Expressed in [[International System of Units|SI units]], the unit of measurement is [[Volts]]/[[second]], (but usually is measured by Volts/\u03bcsec).\n\nElectronic circuits may specify minimum or maximum limits on the slew rates for their inputs or outputs, with these limits only valid under some set of given conditions (e.g. output loading). When given for the output of a circuit, such as an amplifier, the slew rate specification guarantees that the speed of the output signal transition will be at least the given minimum, or at most the given maximum. When applied to the input of a circuit, it instead indicates that the external driving circuitry needs to meet those limits in order to guarantee the correct operation of the receiving device. If these limits are violated, some error might occur and correct operation is no longer guaranteed. For example, when the input to a digital circuit is driven too slowly, the digital input value registered by the circuit may oscillate between 0 and 1 during the signal transition.<ref>http://www.microsemi.com/document-portal/doc_view/130021-ac161-using-schmitt-triggers-for-low-slew-rate-input-app-note</ref> In other cases, a ''maximum'' slew rate is specified<ref>http://www.nxp.com/documents/user_manual/UM10204.pdf revision 6, pg 48: the Fast-mode and Fast-mode Plus minimum rise/fall times effectively become a maximum slew rate limit.</ref> in order to limit the high frequency content present in the signal, thereby preventing such undesirable effects as ringing or radiated EMI.<ref>http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1224734</ref>\n\nIn amplifiers, limitations in slew rate capability can give rise to non-linear effects. For a [[sinusoidal]] waveform not to be subject to slew rate limitation, the slew rate capability (in volts per second) at all points in an [[amplifier]] must satisfy the following condition:\n:<math>\\mathrm{SR} \\ge 2\\pi f V_{\\mathrm{pk}}, </math>\n\nwhere ''f'' is the operating frequency, and <math>V_{\\mathrm{pk}}</math> is the peak amplitude of the waveform.\n\nIn [[mechanics]] the '''slew rate''' is given in [[dimensional analysis|dimensions]] 1/''T'' and is associated with the change in position over time of an object which orbits around the observer.  Slew rate can also be measured in degrees per second.\n\n==Definition==\nThe slew rate of an electronic circuit is defined as the rate of change of the [[voltage]] per unit time. Slew rate is usually expressed in units of [[volt|V]]/[[microsecond|&micro;s]].\n\n: <math>\\mathrm{SR} = \\max\\left(\\left|\\frac{dv_\\mathrm{out}(t)}{dt}\\right|\\right)</math>\n\nwhere <math>v_\\mathrm{out}(t)</math> is the output produced by the amplifier as a function of time ''t''.\n\n==Measurement==\nThe slew rate can be measured using a function generator (usually square wave) and an oscilloscope. The slew rate is the same, regardless of whether feedback is considered.\n\n==Slew rate limiting in amplifiers==\nThere are slight differences between different amplifier designs in how the slewing phenomenon occurs.  However, the general principles are the same as in this illustration.\n\nThe input stage of modern amplifiers is usually a [[differential amplifier]] with a [[transconductance]] characteristic.  This means the input stage takes a [[differential signaling|differential]] input voltage and produces an output [[Electric current|current]] into the second stage.\n\nThe transconductance is typically very high \u2014 this is where the large open loop gain of the amplifier is generated.  This also means that a fairly small input voltage can cause the input stage to [[Saturation (magnetic)|saturate]].  In [[Saturation (magnetic)|saturation]], the stage produces a nearly constant output current.\n\nThe second stage of modern power amplifiers is, among other things, where [[frequency compensation]] is accomplished.  The [[low-pass filter|low pass]] characteristic of this stage approximates an [[integrator]].  A constant current input will therefore produce a linearly increasing output.  If the second stage has an effective input [[capacitance]] <math>C</math> and voltage gain <math>A_{2}</math>, then slew rate in this example can be expressed as:\n\n: <math>\\mathrm{SR} = \\frac{I_\\mathrm{sat}}{C}A_2</math>\n\nwhere <math>I_\\mathrm{sat}</math> is the output current of the first stage in saturation.\n\nSlew rate helps us identify the maximum input frequency and amplitude applicable to the amplifier such that the output is not significantly distorted. Thus it becomes imperative to check the datasheet for the device's slew rate before using it for high-frequency applications.\n\n==Musical applications==\n\nIn electronic musical instruments, slew circuitry or software functions are used deliberately to provide a [[portamento]] (also called ''glide'' or ''lag'') feature, where an initial digital value or analog control voltage is slowly transitioned to a new value over a period of time.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.onmyphd.com/?p=slew.rate Slew-rate explanation with interactive example and detailed calculation for a standard opamp circuit]\n* [http://www.analog.com/library/analogdialogue/archives/43-09/edch%201%20op%20amps.pdf Linear Circuit Design Chapter 1: Op Amps]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Slew Rate}}\n[[Category:Electrical parameters]]\n[[Category:Temporal rates]]"}]}}}}
