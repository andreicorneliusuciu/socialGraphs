The result of this application of a weight function is a '''weighted sum''' or [[weighted average]]. Weight functions occur frequently in [[statistics]] and [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], and are closely related to the concept of a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]].  Weight functions can be employed in both discrete and continuous settings. They can be used to construct systems of calculus called \"weighted calculus\"<ref>Jane Grossman, Michael Grossman, Robert Katz.

The weight function <math>w(a) := 1</math> corresponds to the ''unweighted'' situation in which all elements have equal weight.  One can then apply this weight to various concepts.\n\nIf the function <math>\\scriptstyle f\\colon A \\to {\\Bbb R}</math> is a [[real number|real]]-valued [[mathematical function|function]], then the ''unweighted [[summation|sum]] of <math>f</math> on '''<math>A</math>''''' is defined as\n\n:<math>\\sum_{a \\in A} f(a);</math>\n\nbut given a ''weight function'' <math>\\scriptstyle w\\colon A \\to {\\Bbb R}^+</math>, the '''weighted sum''' or [[conical combination]] is defined as\n\n:<math>\\sum_{a \\in A} f(a) w(a).</math>\n\nOne common application of weighted sums arises in [[numerical integration]].\n\nIf ''B'' is a [[finite set|finite]] subset of ''A'', one can replace the unweighted [[cardinality]] ''|B|'' of ''B'' by the ''weighted cardinality'' \n\n:<math>\\sum_{a \\in B} w(a).</math>\n\nIf ''A'' is a [[finite set|finite]] non-empty set, one can replace the unweighted [[mean]] or [[average]] \n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{|A|} \\sum_{a \\in A} f(a)</math>\n\nby the [[weighted mean]] or [[weighted average]] \n\n:<math> \\frac{\\sum_{a \\in A} f(a) w(a)}{\\sum_{a \\in A} w(a)}.</math>\n\nIn this case only the ''relative'' weights are relevant.\n\n=== Statistics ===\nWeighted means are commonly used in [[statistics]] to compensate for the presence of [[Bias_(statistics)|bias]].  For a quantity  <math>f</math> measured multiple independent times <math>f_i</math> with [[variance]] <math>\\scriptstyle\\sigma^2_i</math>, the best estimate of the signal is obtained \nby averaging all the measurements with weight <math>\\scriptstyle w_i=\\frac 1 {\\sigma_i^2}</math>, and\nthe resulting variance is smaller than each of the independent measurements\n<math>\\scriptstyle\\sigma^2=1/\\sum w_i</math>. The [[maximum likelihood]] method weights the difference between fit and data using the same weights <math>w_i</math>.\n\nThe [[expected value]] of a random variable is the weighted average of the possible values it might take on, with the weights being the respective [[probability|probabilities]]. More generally, the expected value of a function of a random variable is the probability-weighted average of the values the function takes on for each possible value of the random variable.\n\nIn [[linear regression|regressions]] in which the [[dependent variable]] is assumed to be affected by both current and lagged (past) values of the [[independent variable]], a [[distributed lag]] function is estimated, this function being a weighted average of the current and various lagged independent variable values. Similarly, a [[moving average model]] specifies an evolving variable as a weighted average of current and various lagged values of a random variable.\n\n=== Mechanics ===\nThe terminology ''weight function'' arises from [[mechanics]]: if one has a collection of ''<math>n</math>'' objects on a [[lever]], with weights <math>\\scriptstyle w_1, \\ldots, w_n</math> (where [[weight]] is now interpreted in the physical sense) and locations :<math>\\scriptstyle\\boldsymbol{x}_1,\\dotsc,\\boldsymbol{x}_n</math>, then the lever will be in balance if the [[Lever|fulcrum]] of the lever is at the [[center of mass]] \n\n:<math>\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i \\boldsymbol{x}_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i},</math>\n\nwhich is also the weighted average of the positions <math>\\scriptstyle\\boldsymbol{x}_i</math>.\n\n== Continuous weights ==\nIn the continuous setting, a weight is a positive [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] such as <math>w(x) \\, dx</math> on some [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] <math>\\Omega</math>,which is typically a [[subset]] of a [[Euclidean space]] <math>\\scriptstyle{\\Bbb R}^n</math>, for instance <math>\\Omega</math> could be an [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] <math>[a,b]</math>.  Here <math>dx</math> is [[Lebesgue measure]] and <math>\\scriptstyle w\\colon \\Omega \\to \\R^+</math> is a non-negative [[measurable]] [[mathematical function|function]].  In this context, the weight function <math>w(x)</math> is sometimes referred to as a [[density]].\n\n=== General definition ===\nIf <math>f\\colon \\Omega \\to {\\Bbb R}</math> is a [[real number|real]]-valued [[mathematical function|function]], then the ''unweighted'' [[integral]]\n\n:<math>\\int_\\Omega f(x)\\ dx</math>\n\ncan be generalized to the ''weighted integral'' \n\n:<math>\\int_\\Omega f(x) w(x)\\, dx</math>\n\nNote that one may need to require <math>f</math> to be [[absolutely integrable function|absolutely integrable]] with respect to the weight <math>w(x) \\, dx</math> in order for this integral to be finite.\n\n=== Weighted volume ===\nIf ''E'' is a subset of <math>\\Omega</math>, then the [[volume]] vol(''E'') of ''E'' can be generalized to the ''weighted volume'' \n:<math> \\int_E w(x)\\ dx,</math>\n\n=== Weighted average ===\nIf <math>\\Omega</math> has finite non-zero weighted volume, then we can replace the unweighted [[average]] \n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{vol}(\\Omega)} \\int_\\Omega f(x)\\ dx</math>\n\nby the '''weighted average''' \n\n:<math> \\frac{\\int_\\Omega f(x)\\ w(x) dx}{\\int_\\Omega w(x)\\ dx}</math>\n\n=== Bilinear form ===\nIf <math> f\\colon \\Omega \\to {\\Bbb R}</math> and <math> g\\colon \\Omega \\to {\\Bbb R}</math> are two functions, one can generalize the unweighted [[bilinear form]] \n\n:<math>\\langle f, g \\rangle := \\int_\\Omega f(x) g(x)\\ dx</math>\n\nto a weighted bilinear form \n\n:<math>\\langle f, g \\rangle := \\int_\\Omega f(x) g(x)\\ w(x)\\ dx.</math>\n\nSee the entry on [[orthogonal polynomials]] for examples of weighted [[orthogonal functions]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Center of mass]]\n* [[Numerical integration]]\n* [[Orthogonality]]\n* [[Weighted mean]]\n* [[Kernel (statistics)]]\n* [[Measure (mathematics)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Weight Function}}\n[[Category:Mathematical analysis]]\n[[Category:Measure theory]]\n[[Category:Combinatorial optimization]]\n[[Category:Functional analysis]]\n[[Category:Types of functions]]"}]}}}}
