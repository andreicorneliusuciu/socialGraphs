For flow around [[Bluff body|bluff bodies]], drag is most often dominating, and then the qualifier \"parasitic\" is meaningless.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Form drag, skin friction and interference drag on bluff bodies are not coined as being elements of \"parasitic drag\", but directly as elements of drag.\n\nFurther, lift-induced drag is only relevant when [[wing]]s or a [[lifting body]] are present, and is therefore usually discussed either in the aviation perspective of drag, or in the design of either semi-planing or [[planing hull]]s. [[Wave drag]] occurs when a solid object is moving through a fluid at or near the [[speed of sound]] in that fluid\u2014or in case there is a freely-moving fluid surface with [[ocean surface wave|surface waves]] radiating from the object, e.g. from a ship.\n\n[[File:Drag coefficient on a sphere vs. Reynolds number - main trends.svg|right|thumb|Drag coefficient ''C''<sub>d</sub> for a sphere as a function of [[Reynolds number]] ''Re'', as obtained from laboratory experiments. The dark line is for a sphere with a smooth surface, while the lighter line is for the case of a rough surface.]]\nDrag depends on the properties of the fluid and on the size, shape, and speed of the object. One way to express this is by means of the [[drag equation]]:\n:<math>F_D\\, =\\, \\tfrac12\\, \\rho\\, v^2\\, C_D\\, A</math>\nwhere\n:''<math>F_D</math>'' is the '''drag force''',\n:<math>\\rho</math> is the [[density]] of the fluid,<ref>Note that for [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]], the air density can be found using the [[barometric formula]].

At low <math>R_e</math>, <math>C_D</math> is asymptotically proportional to <math>R_e^{-1}</math>, which means that the drag is proportional to the speed. At high <math>R_e</math>, <math>C_D</math> is more or less constant. The graph to the right shows how <math>C_D</math> varies with <math>R_e</math> for the case of a sphere.\n\nFor high velocities (or more precisely, at high [[Reynolds number]]) drag will vary as the square of [[velocity]]. Thus, the resultant power needed to overcome this drag will vary as the cube of velocity. The standard equation for drag is one half <math>C_D</math> multiplied by the fluid [[mass density]], the [[cross sectional area]] of the specified item, and the square of the velocity.\n\n== Drag at high velocity ==\n{{main|Drag equation}}\n[[File:194144main 022 drag.ogg|thumb|320px|Explanation of drag by [[NASA]].]]\nAs mentioned, the [[drag equation]] with a constant drag coefficient gives the force experienced by an object moving through a [[fluid]] at relatively large velocity (i.e. high [[Reynolds number]], Re&nbsp;>&nbsp;~1000). This is also called ''quadratic drag''. The equation is attributed to [[Lord Rayleigh]], who originally used ''L''<sup>2</sup> in place of ''A'' (''L'' being some length).\n\n:<math>F_D\\, =\\, \\tfrac12\\, \\rho\\, v^2\\, C_d\\, A,</math>\n<sup>[[Drag equation#Derivation|see derivation]]</sup>\n\nThe reference area ''A'' is often [[orthographic projection]] of the object\u2014on a plane perpendicular to the direction of motion\u2014e.g. for objects with a simple shape, such as a sphere, this is the [[cross section (geometry)|cross sectional]] area. Sometimes different reference areas are given for the same object in which case a drag coefficient corresponding to each of these different areas must be given.\n\nIn case of a wing, comparison of the drag to the [[Lift (force)|lift force]] is easiest when the reference areas are the same, since then the ratio of drag to lift force is just the ratio of drag to [[lift coefficient]].<ref>[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/sized.html ''Size effects on drag''], from NASA Glenn Research Center.</ref> Therefore, the reference for a wing is often the lifting area (\"wing area\") rather than the frontal area.<ref>[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/geom.html ''Wing geometry definitions''], from NASA Glenn Research Center.</ref>\n\nFor an object with a smooth surface, and non-fixed [[flow separation|separation point]]s\u2014like a sphere or circular cylinder\u2014the drag coefficient may vary with Reynolds number ''R<sub>e</sub>'', even up to very high values (''R<sub>e</sub>'' of the [[order of magnitude|order]] 10<sup>7</sup>).\n<ref>{{cite journal | last=Roshko | first=Anatol | title=Experiments on the flow past a circular cylinder at very high Reynolds number | journal=Journal of Fluid Mechanics | volume=10 | issue=3 | year=1961 | pages=345\u2013356 | doi=10.1017/S0022112061000950 |bibcode = 1961JFM....10..345R }}</ref>\n<ref name=Batch341>Batchelor (1967), p. 341.</ref>\nFor an object with well-defined fixed separation points, like a circular disk with its plane normal to the flow direction, the drag coefficient is constant for ''R<sub>e</sub>''&nbsp;>&nbsp;3,500.<ref name=Batch341/>\nFurther the drag coefficient ''C<sub>d</sub>'' is, in general, a function of the orientation of the flow with respect to the object (apart from symmetrical objects like a sphere).\n\n=== Power ===\n\nThe [[power (physics)|power]] required to overcome the aerodynamic drag is given by:\n\n::<math> P_d = \\mathbf{F}_d \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = \\tfrac12 \\rho v^3 A C_d</math>\n\nNote that the power needed to push an object through a fluid increases as the cube of the velocity.

Since power is the rate of doing work, four times the work done in half the time requires eight times the power.\n\n=== Velocity of a falling object ===\n{{main|Terminal velocity}}\n[[File:Speed vs time for objects with drag.png|right|800px|thumb|An object falling through viscous medium accelerates quickly towards its terminal speed, approaching gradually as the speed gets nearer to the terminal speed.  Whether the object experiences turbulent or laminar drag changes the characteristic shape of the graph with turbulent flow resulting in a constant acceleration for a larger fraction of its accelerating time.]]\nThe velocity as a function of time for an object falling through a non-dense medium, and released at zero relative-velocity ''v''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 at time ''t''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, is roughly given by a function involving a [[hyperbolic tangent]] (tanh):\n\n::<math> v(t) = \\sqrt{ \\frac{2mg}{\\rho A C_d} } \\tanh \\left(t \\sqrt{\\frac{g \\rho C_d A}{2 m}} \\right). \\,</math>\n\nThe hyperbolic tangent has a [[Limit of a function|limit]] value of one, for large time ''t''.

For example, for a human body (<math> \\mathbf{} d </math> ~ 0.6 m) <math> \\mathbf{} v_t </math> ~ 70&nbsp;m/s, for a small animal like a cat (<math> \\mathbf{} d </math> ~ 0.2 m) <math> \\mathbf{} v_t </math> ~ 40&nbsp;m/s, for a small bird (<math> \\mathbf{} d </math> ~ 0.05 m) <math> \\mathbf{} v_t </math> ~ 20&nbsp;m/s, for an insect (<math> \\mathbf{} d </math> ~ 0.01 m) <math> \\mathbf{} v_t </math> ~ 9&nbsp;m/s, and so on. Terminal velocity for very small objects (pollen, etc.) at low Reynolds numbers is determined by Stokes law.\n\nTerminal velocity is higher for larger creatures, and thus potentially more deadly.  A creature such as a mouse falling at its terminal velocity is much more likely to survive impact with the ground than a human falling at its terminal velocity.  A small animal such as a [[cricket (insect)|cricket]] impacting at its terminal velocity will probably be unharmed. This, combined with the relative ratio of limb cross-sectional area vs. body mass (commonly referred to as the [[Square-cube law]]), explains why very small animals can fall from a large height and not be harmed.<ref>Haldane, J.B.S., [http://irl.cs.ucla.edu/papers/right-size.html \"On Being the Right Size\"]</ref>\n\n== Very low Reynolds numbers: Stokes' drag ==\n[[File:Inclinedthrow.gif|thumb|400px|[[Trajectory|Trajectories]] of three objects thrown at the same angle (70\u00b0).

In this case, the force of drag is approximately proportional to velocity, but opposite in direction.

(1975) ''Aerodynamics'' Fig 5.24. Pitman Publishing Limited, London. ISBN 0-273-01120-0</ref><ref>Hurt, H. H. (1965) ''Aerodynamics for Naval Aviators'', Figure 1.30, NAVWEPS 00-80T-80</ref>]]\n'''Lift-induced drag''' (also called '''induced drag''') is drag which occurs as the result of the creation of [[lift (force)|lift]] on a three-dimensional [[lifting body]], such as the [[wing]] or fuselage of an airplane. Induced drag consists of two primary components, including drag due to the creation of vortices ('''vortex drag''') and the presence of additional viscous drag ('''lift-induced viscous drag'''). The vortices in the flow-field, present in the wake of a lifting body, derive from the turbulent mixing of air of varying pressure on the upper and lower surfaces of the body, which is a necessary condition for the creation of [[lift (force)|lift]].\n\nWith other parameters remaining the same, as the [[lift (force)|lift]] generated by a body increases, so does the lift-induced drag. For an aircraft in flight, this means that as the [[angle of attack]], and therefore the [[lift coefficient]], increases to the point of stall, so does the lift-induced drag. At the onset of [[Stall (flight)|stall]], lift is abruptly decreased, as is lift-induced drag, but viscous pressure drag, a component of parasite drag, increases due to the formation of turbulent unattached flow on the surface of the body.\n\n=== Parasitic drag ===\n{{main|parasitic drag}}\n\n'''Parasitic drag''' (also called '''parasite drag''') is drag caused by moving a solid object through a fluid. Parasitic drag is made up of multiple components including viscous pressure drag ('''form drag'''), and drag due to surface roughness ('''skin friction drag'''). Additionally, the presence of multiple bodies in relative proximity may incur so called '''interference drag''', which is sometimes described as a component of parasitic drag.\n\nIn aviation, [[induced drag]] tends to be greater at lower speeds because a high [[angle of attack]] is required to maintain lift, creating more drag. However, as speed increases the induced drag becomes much less, but parasitic drag increases because the fluid is flowing more quickly around protruding objects increasing friction or drag. At even higher speeds in the [[transonic]], [[wave drag]] enters the picture. Each of these forms of drag changes in proportion to the others based on speed. The combined overall drag curve therefore shows a minimum at some airspeed - an aircraft flying at this speed will be at or close to its optimal efficiency. Pilots will use this speed to maximize [[Endurance (aircraft)|endurance]] (minimum fuel consumption), or maximize [[Glide ratio|gliding range]] in the event of an engine failure.\n\n=== Power curve in aviation ===\n[[File:Drag curves for aircraft in flight.svg|right|thumb|The ''power curve'': form and induced drag ''vs.'' airspeed]]\n\nThe interaction of parasitic and induced drag ''vs.'' airspeed can be plotted as a characteristic curve, illustrated here. In aviation, this is often referred to as the ''power curve'', and is important to pilots because it shows that, below a certain airspeed, maintaining airspeed counterintuitively requires ''more'' thrust as speed decreases, rather than less. The consequences of being \"behind the curve\" in flight are important and are taught as part of pilot training. At the subsonic airspeeds where the \"U\" shape of this curve is significant, wave drag has not yet become a factor, and so it is not shown in the curve.\n\n=== Wave drag in transonic and supersonic flow ===\n[[File:Qualitive variation of cd with mach number.png|thumb|right|Qualitative variation in Cd factor with Mach number for aircraft]]\n{{main|wave drag}}\n'''Wave drag''' (also called '''compressibility drag''') is drag which is created by the presence of a body moving at high speed through a compressible fluid. In [[aerodynamics]], Wave drag consists of multiple components depending on the speed regime of the flight.\n\nIn transonic flight (Mach numbers greater than about 0.8 and less than about 1.4), wave drag is the result of the formation of shockwaves on the body, formed when areas of local supersonic (Mach number greater than 1.0) flow are created. In practice, supersonic flow occurs on bodies traveling well below the speed of sound, as the local speed of air on a body increases when it accelerates over the body, in this case above Mach 1.0. However, full supersonic flow over the vehicle will not develop until well past Mach 1.0. Aircraft flying at transonic speed often incur wave drag through the normal course of operation. In transonic flight, wave drag is commonly referred to as '''transonic compressibility drag'''. Transonic compressibility drag increases significantly as the speed of flight increases towards Mach 1.0, dominating other forms of drag at these speeds.\n\nIn supersonic flight (Mach numbers greater than 1.0), '''wave drag''' is the result of shockwaves present on the body, typically '''oblique shockwaves''' formed at the leading and trailing edges of the body. In highly supersonic flows, or in bodies with turning angles sufficiently large, '''unattached shockwaves''', or '''bow waves''' will instead form. Additionally, local areas of transonic flow behind the initial shockwave may occur at lower supersonic speeds, and can lead to the development of additional, smaller shockwaves present on the surfaces of other lifting bodies, similar to those found in transonic flows. In supersonic flow regimes, '''wave drag''' is commonly separated into two components, '''supersonic lift-dependent wave drag''' and '''supersonic volume-dependent wave drag'''.\n\nThe closed form solution for the minimum wave drag of a body of revolution with a fixed length was found by Sears and Haack, and is known as the '''Sears-Haack Distribution'''. Similarly, for a fixed volume, the shape for minimum wave drag is the '''Von Karman Ogive'''.\n\n[[Busemann's Biplane]] is not, in principle, subject to wave drag at all when operated at its design speed, but is incapable of generating lift.\n\n==d'Alembert's paradox==\n{{main|d'Alembert's paradox}}\n\nIn 1752 [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]] proved that [[potential flow]], the 18th century state-of-the-art [[inviscid flow]] theory amenable to mathematical solutions, resulted in the prediction of zero drag.  This was in contradiction with experimental evidence, and became known as d'Alembert's paradox.  In the 19th century the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]] for the description of [[viscosity|viscous]] flow were developed by [[Adh\u00e9mar Jean Claude Barr\u00e9 de Saint-Venant|Saint-Venant]], [[Claude-Louis Navier|Navier]] and [[George Gabriel Stokes|Stokes]].  Stokes derived the drag around a sphere at very low [[Reynolds number]]s, the result of which is called [[Stokes' law]].<ref name=Batchelor>Batchelor (2000), pp. 337\u2013343.</ref>\n\nIn the limit of high Reynolds numbers, the Navier\u2013Stokes equations approach the inviscid [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]], of which the potential-flow solutions considered by d'Alembert are solutions.  However, all experiments at high Reynolds numbers showed there is drag. Attempts to construct inviscid [[steady flow]] solutions to the Euler equations, other than the potential flow solutions, did not result in realistic results.<ref name=Batchelor/>\n\nThe notion of [[boundary layer]]s\u2014introduced by [[Ludwig Prandtl|Prandtl]] in 1904, founded on both theory and experiments\u2014explained the causes of drag at high Reynolds numbers.  The boundary layer is the thin layer of fluid close to the object's boundary, where viscous effects remain important even when the viscosity is very small (or equivalently the Reynolds number is very large).<ref name=Batchelor/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{colbegin|2}}\n* [[Added mass]]\n* [[Aerodynamic force]]\n* [[Angle of attack]]\n* [[Boundary layer]]\n* [[Coand\u0103 effect]]\n* [[Drag crisis]]\n* [[Drag coefficient]]\n* [[Drag equation]]\n* [[Gravity drag]]\n* [[Keulegan\u2013Carpenter number]]\n* [[Morison equation]]\n* [[Nose cone design]]\n* [[Parasitic drag]]\n* [[Ram pressure]]\n* [[Reynolds number]]\n* [[Stall (fluid mechanics)]]\n* [[Stokes' law]]\n* [[Terminal velocity]]\n* [[Windage]]\n\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*{{cite book | author=French, A.
