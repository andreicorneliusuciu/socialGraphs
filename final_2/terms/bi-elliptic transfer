The magnitude of the required delta-v for this burn is:\n\n:<math>\\Delta v_1 = \\sqrt{ \\frac{2 \\mu}{r_0} - \\frac{\\mu}{a_1}} - \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{r_0}} </math>\n\nWhen the apoapsis of the first transfer ellipse is reached at a distance <math>r_b</math> from the primary, a second prograde burn (mark 2) raises the periapsis to match the radius of the target circular orbit, putting the spacecraft on a second elliptic trajectory (orange half ellipse). The magnitude of the required delta-v for the second burn is:\n\n:<math>\\Delta v_2 = \\sqrt{ \\frac{2 \\mu}{r_b} - \\frac{\\mu}{a_2}} - \\sqrt{ \\frac{2 \\mu}{r_b} - \\frac{\\mu}{a_1}} </math>\n\nLastly, when the final circular orbit with radius <math>r_f</math> is reached, a [[Retrograde and prograde motion|''retrograde'']] burn (mark 3) circularizes the trajectory into the final target orbit  (red circle). The final retrograde burn requires a delta-v of magnitude:\n\n:<math>\\Delta v_3 = \\sqrt{ \\frac{2 \\mu}{r_f} - \\frac{\\mu}{a_2}} - \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{r_f}} </math>\n\nIf <math>r_b=r_f</math>, then the maneuver reduces to a Hohmann transfer (in that case <math>\\Delta v_3</math> can be verified to become zero). Thus the bi-elliptic transfer constitutes a more general class of orbital transfers, of which the Hohmann transfer is a special two-impulse case.\n\n[[File:Bi-parabolicTransfer.pdf|thumb|A bi-parabolic transfer from a low circular starting orbit (dark blue), to a higher circular orbit (red).]]\nThe maximum savings possible can be computed by assuming that <math>r_b=\\infty</math>, in which case the total <math>\\Delta v</math> simplifies to <math>\\left(\\sqrt 2 - 1\\right) \\left(\\sqrt{\\mu/r_0} + \\sqrt{\\mu/r_f}\\right)</math>.\n\nIn this case one also speaks of a ''bi-parabolic'' transfer because the two transfer trajectories no longer are ellipses but [[Parabolic orbit|parabola]]. The transfer time increases to infinity too.\n\n===Transfer time===\nLike the Hohmann transfer, both transfer orbits used in the bi-elliptic transfer constitute exactly one half of an elliptic orbit. This means that the time required to execute each phase of the transfer is half the orbital period of each transfer ellipse.\n\nUsing the equation for the [[orbital period]] and the notation from above:\n\n:<math>T = 2 \\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{a^3}{\\mu}}</math>\n\nThe total transfer time <math>t</math> is the sum of the time required for each half orbit. Therefore:\n\n:<math>t_1 = \\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{a_1^3}{\\mu}} \\quad and \\quad t_2 = \\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2^3}{\\mu}}</math>\n\nAnd finally:\n\n:<math>t = t_1 + t_2 \\;</math>\n\n== Comparison with the Hohmann transfer ==\n\n=== Delta-v ===\n[[File:ComparisonComparisonZoom.pdf|thumb|Delta-v requirements (normed with <math>v_1</math>) for four maneuvers between the two same circular orbits depending on the radius ratio <math>\\tfrac{r_2}{r_1}</math>.]]\n\nThe figure on the right shows the Delta-v needed for a transfer between a circular orbit with radius <math>r_1</math> and a circular orbit with radius <math>r_2</math>.\n\n<math>\\Delta v</math> is normed with the initial velocity <math>v_1</math>, to make the comparison general.

It even becomes infinite for the bi-parabolic transfer limiting case.\n\nThe Hohmann transfer takes less than half of the time because there is just one half transfer ellipse, to be precise\n\n: <math> t=\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{a^3}{\\mu}}</math>\n\n==Example==\nTo transfer from a circular low Earth orbit with ''r''<sub>0</sub>=6700&nbsp;km to a new circular orbit with ''r''<sub>1</sub>=93800&nbsp;km using a [[Hohmann transfer orbit]] requires a \u0394v of 2825.02+1308.70=4133.72&nbsp;m/s. However, because ''r''<sub>1</sub>=14''r''<sub>0</sub>&thinsp;&gt;11.94''r''<sub>0</sub>, it is possible to do better with a bi-elliptic transfer. If the spaceship first accelerated 3061.04&nbsp;m/s, thus achieving an elliptic orbit with apogee at ''r''<sub>2</sub>=40''r''<sub>0</sub>=268000&nbsp;km, then at apogee accelerated another 608.825&nbsp;m/s to a new orbit with perigee at ''r''<sub>1</sub>=93800&nbsp;km, and finally at perigee of this second transfer orbit decelerated by 447.662&nbsp;m/s, entering the final circular orbit, then the total \u0394v would be only 4117.53&nbsp;m/s, which is 16.19&nbsp;m/s (0.4%) less.\n\nThe \u0394v saving could be further improved by increasing the intermediate apogee, at the expense of longer transfer time. For example, an apogee of 75.8''r''<sub>0</sub>=507,688&nbsp;km (1.3 times the distance to the Moon) would result in a 1% \u0394v saving over a Hohmann transfer, but a transit time of 17 days. As an impractical extreme example, an apogee of 1757''r''<sub>0</sub>=11,770,000&nbsp;km (30 times the distance to the Moon) would result in a 2% \u0394v saving over a Hohmann transfer, but the transfer would require 4.5 years (and, in practice, be perturbed by the gravitational effects of other solar system bodies). For comparison, the Hohmann transfer requires 15 hours and 34 minutes.\n\n{| class='wikitable'\n|+ \u0394v for various orbital transfers\n!  Type       !! Hohmann ||colspan=4| Bi-elliptic \n|-\n!

This yields a higher contribution to the [[specific orbital energy]] and, due to the [[Oberth effect]], is responsible for the net reduction in required delta-v.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Spaceflight}}\n*[[Delta-v budget]]\n*[[Oberth effect]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{orbits}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bi-Elliptic Transfer}}\n[[Category:Astrodynamics]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft propulsion]]\n[[Category:Orbital maneuvers]]"}]}}}}
