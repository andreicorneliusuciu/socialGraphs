When a dielectric is placed in an external [[electric field]], its molecules gain [[electric dipole moment]] and the dielectric is said to be polarized. The electric dipole moment induced per unit volume of the dielectric material is called the electric polarization of the dielectric.<ref name=\"Gri07\">''Introduction to Electrodynamics'' (3rd Edition), D.J.

Parker, 1994, ISBN 0-07-051400-3</ref>\n\nPolarization density also describes how a material responds to an applied electric field as well as the way the material changes the electric field, and can be used to calculate the forces that result from those interactions. It can be compared to [[magnetization]], which is the measure of the corresponding response of a material to a [[magnetic field]] in [[magnetism]]. The [[SI]] unit of measure is [[coulomb]]s per square meter, and polarization density is represented by a vector '''P'''.<ref name=\"Enc94\" />\n\n==Definition==\n\nAn external electric field that is applied to a dielectric material, causes a displacement of bound charged elements. These are elements which are bound to molecules and are not free to move around the material. Positive charged elements are displaced in the direction of the field, and negative charged elements are displaced opposite to the direction of the field. The molecules may remain neutral in charge, yet an electric dipole moment forms.<ref name=\"Irodov\">[[Igor Irodov|Irodov, I.E.]] (1986). ''Basic Laws of Electromagnetism''.

Note that \u03c7 is just a scalar. This is a particular case due to the ''isotropy'' of the dielectric.\n\nTaking into account this relation between '''P''' and '''E''', equation (3) becomes:<ref name=\"Irodov\" />\n\n:{{oiint|preintegral=<math>-Q_b  =  \\chi\\varepsilon_0\\  </math>|intsubscpt=<math>{\\scriptstyle S}</math> |integrand=<math>\\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{A}</math>}}\n\nThe expression in the integral is [[Gauss's law]] for the field '''E''' which yields the total charge, both free <math>(Q_f)</math> and bound <math>(Q_b)</math>, in the volume ''V'' enclosed by ''S''.<ref name=\"Irodov\" /> Therefore,\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n-Q_b &= \\chi Q_{\\mathrm{total}}\\\\\n&= \\chi (Q_f + Q_b)\\\\\nQ_b &= -\\frac{\\chi}{1+ \\chi}Q_f,\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhich can be written in terms of free charge and bound charge densities (by considering the relationship between the charges, their volume charge densities and the given volume):\n\n:<math>\\rho_b = -\\frac{\\chi}{1+ \\chi}\\rho_f</math>\n\nSince within a homogeneous dielectric there can be no free charges <math>(\\rho_f = 0)</math>, by the last equation it follows that there is no bulk bound charge in the material <math>(\\rho_b = 0)</math>.

The case of an anisotropic dielectric medium is described by the field of [[crystal optics]].\n\nAs in most electromagnetism, this relation deals with macroscopic averages of the fields and dipole density, so that one has a continuum approximation of the dielectric materials that neglects atomic-scale behaviors. The [[polarizability]] of individual particles in the medium can be related to the average susceptibility and polarization density by the [[Clausius-Mossotti relation]].\n\nIn general, the susceptibility is a function of the [[frequency]] \u03c9 of the applied field.  When the field is an arbitrary function of time ''t'', the polarization is a [[convolution]] of the [[continuous Fourier transform|Fourier transform]] of \u03c7(\u03c9) with the '''E'''(''t'').  This reflects the fact that the dipoles in the material cannot respond instantaneously to the applied field, and [[causality]] considerations lead to the [[Kramers\u2013Kronig relation]]s.\n\nIf the polarization '''P''' is not linearly proportional to the electric field '''E''', the medium is termed ''nonlinear'' and is described by the field of [[nonlinear optics]].  To a good approximation (for sufficiently weak fields, assuming no permanent dipole moments are present), '''P''' is usually given by a [[Taylor series]] in '''E''' whose coefficients are the nonlinear susceptibilities:\n\n:<math>\\frac{P_i}{\\epsilon_0} = \\sum_j  \\chi^{(1)}_{ij} E_j  +  \\sum_{jk} \\chi_{ijk}^{(2)} E_j E_k + \\sum_{jk\\ell} \\chi_{ijk\\ell}^{(3)} E_j E_k E_\\ell  + \\cdots \\!</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\chi^{(1)}</math> is the linear susceptibility, <math>\\chi^{(2)}</math> is the second-order susceptibility (describing phenomena such as the [[Pockels effect]], [[optical rectification]] and [[second-harmonic generation]]), and <math>\\chi^{(3)}</math> is the third-order susceptibility (describing third-order effects such as the [[Kerr effect]] and electric field-induced optical rectification).\n\nIn [[ferroelectric]] materials, there is no one-to-one correspondence between '''P''' and '''E''' at all because of [[hysteresis]].\n\n==Polarization density in Maxwell's equations==\n\nThe behavior of [[electric fields]] ('''E''' and '''D'''), [[magnetic field]]s ('''B''', '''H'''),  [[charge density]] (\u03c1) and [[current density]] ('''J''') are described by [[Maxwell's equations#.22Microscopic.22 versus .22macroscopic.22|Maxwell's equations in matter]].\n\n===Relations between E, D and P===\n\nIn terms of volume charge densities, the '''free''' charge density <math>\\rho_f</math> is given by\n\n:<math>\\rho_f = \\rho - \\rho_b</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\rho</math> is the total charge density. By considering the relationship of each of the terms of the above equation to the divergence of their corresponding fields (of the [[electric displacement field]] '''D''', '''E''' and '''P''' in that order), this can be written as:<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Saleh | first = B.E.A. | last2 = Teich  | first2 = M.C.\n  | title = Fundamentals of Photonics  | publisher = [[John Wiley & Sons|Wiley]]   | year = 2007  | location = Hoboken, NJ\n  | pages = 154  | isbn = 978-0-471-35832-9}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{D} = \\varepsilon_0\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{P}.</math>\n\nHere ''\u03b5<sub>0</sub>'' is the [[electric permittivity]] of empty space.

(a) A solid crystal. (b) By pairing the positive and negative charges in a certain way, the crystal appears to have an upward polarization. (c) By pairing the charges differently, the crystal appears to have a downward polarization.]]\nThe polarization inside a solid is not, in general, uniquely defined: It depends on which electrons are paired up with which nuclei.<ref name=Respa>{{cite journal |last=Resta |first=Raffaele |year=1994 |title=Macroscopic polarization in crystalline dielectrics: the geometric phase approach |journal=Rev. Mod. Phys. |volume=66 |pages=899 |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.66.899 |url=http://inside.mines.edu/~zhiwu/research/papers/E04_berry2.pdf|bibcode = 1994RvMP...66..899R }} See also: [http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~dhv/talks/rahman.pdf  D Vanderbilt, ''Berry phases and Curvatures in Electronic Structure Theory''], an introductory-level powerpoint.</ref> (See figure.) In other words, two people, Alice and Bob, looking at the same solid, may calculate different values of '''P''', and neither of them will be wrong. Alice and Bob will agree on the microscopic electric field '''E''' in the solid, but disagree on the value of the displacement field <math>\\mathbf{D}=\\varepsilon_0 \\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{P}</math>. They will both find that Gauss's law is correct (<math>\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{D}= \\rho_f</math>), but they will disagree on the value of <math>\\rho_f</math> at the surfaces of the crystal. For example, if Alice interprets the bulk solid to consist of dipoles with positive ions above and negative ions below, but the real crystal has negative ions as the topmost surface, then Alice will say that there is a negative free charge at the topmost surface. (She might view this as a type of [[surface reconstruction]]).\n\nOn the other hand, even though the value of '''P''' is not uniquely defined in a bulk solid, ''variations'' in '''P''' ''are'' uniquely defined.<ref name=Respa/> If the crystal is gradually changed from one structure to another, there will be a current inside each unit cell, due to the motion of nuclei and electrons. This current results in a macroscopic transfer of charge from one side of the crystal to the other, and therefore it can be measured with an ammeter (like any other current) when wires are attached to the opposite sides of the crystal. The time-integral of the current is proportional to the change in '''P'''. The current can be calculated in computer simulations (such as [[density functional theory]]); the formula for the integrated current turns out to be a type of [[Berry's phase]].<ref name=Respa/>\n\nThe non-uniqueness of '''P''' is not problematic, because every measurable consequence of '''P''' is in fact a consequence of a continuous change in '''P'''.<ref name=Respa/> For example, when a material is put in an electric field '''E''', which ramps up from zero to a finite value, the material's electronic and ionic positions slightly shift. This changes '''P''', and the result is [[electric susceptibility]] (and hence [[permittivity]]). As another example, when some crystals are heated, their electronic and ionic positions slightly shift, changing '''P'''. The result is [[pyroelectricity]]. In all cases, the properties of interest are associated with a ''change'' in '''P'''.\n\nEven though the polarization is ''in principle'' non-unique, in practice it is often (not always) defined by convention in a specific, unique way. For example, in a perfectly [[centrosymmetric]] crystal, '''P''' is usually defined by convention to be exactly zero. As another example, in a [[ferroelectric]] crystal, there is typically a [[centrosymmetric]] configuration above the [[Curie temperature]], and '''P''' is defined there by convention to be zero. As the crystal is cooled below the Curie temperature, it shifts gradually into a more and more non-centrosymmetric configuration. Since gradual changes in '''P''' are uniquely defined, this convention gives a unique value of '''P''' for the ferroelectric crystal, even below its Curie temperature.\n\nAnother problem in the definition of '''P''' is related to the arbitrary choice of the \"unit volume\", or more precisely to the system's ''scale''\n.<ref name=\"def_P_M_Maxwell_eqs\"/>\nFor example, at ''microscopic'' scale a plasma can be regarded as a gas of ''free'' charges,\nthus '''P''' should be zero. On the contrary, at a ''macroscopic'' scale the same plasma\ncan be described as a continuous medium, exhibiting a permittivity <math>\\scriptstyle \\varepsilon(\\omega) \\neq 1</math>\nand thus a net polarization '''P'''<math>\\scriptstyle \\neq \\mathbf{0}</math>.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Crystal structure]]\n*[[Electret]]\n*[[Polarization (disambiguation)]]\n\n==References and notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Electric and magnetic fields in matter]]"}]}}}}
