It is also defined as a material's resistance to [[fracture]] when [[stress (physics)|stressed]].\n\nToughness requires a balance of [[Strength of materials|strength]] and [[ductility]].<ref name=NDT/>\n\n==Mathematical definition==\nToughness can be determined by [[Integration (mathematics)|integrating]] the [[stress-strain curve]].<ref name=NDT/> It is the energy of mechanical deformation per unit volume prior to fracture. The explicit mathematical description is:\n\n: <math> \\tfrac{\\mbox{energy}}{\\mbox{volume}} = \\int_{0}^{\\epsilon_f} \\sigma\\, d\\epsilon </math>\n\nwhere\n* <math> \\epsilon_{} </math> is strain\n* <math> \\epsilon_f </math> is the strain upon failure\n* <math> \\sigma </math> is stress\n\nAnother definition is the ability to absorb [[mechanical energy]] up to the point of failure. The area under the stress-strain curve is called toughness.\n\nIf the upper limit of integration up to the yield point is restricted, the energy absorbed per unit volume is known as the [[Resilience (materials science)|modulus of resilience]]. Mathematically, the modulus of resilience can be expressed by the product of the square of the yield stress divided by two times the Young's modulus of elasticity. That is,\n: Modulus of resilience = {{sfrac|Yield stress<sup>2</sup>|2 (Young's modulus)}}\n\n==Toughness tests==\nThe toughness of a material can be measured using a small specimen of that material. A typical testing machine uses a pendulum to strike the specimen and deform it. The height from which the pendulum fell, minus the height to which it rose after deforming the specimen, multiplied by the weight of the pendulum is a measure of the energy absorbed by the specimen as it was deformed during the impact with the pendulum. The [[Charpy impact test|Charpy]] and [[Izod impact strength test|Izod impact tests]] are typical measures of toughness.\n\n==Unit of toughness==\nTensile toughness (or, ''deformation energy'', ''U''<sub>T</sub>) is measured in units of [[joule]] per [[cubic metre]] (J\u00b7m<sup>\u22123</sup>) in the [[SI]] system and inch-[[pound-force]] per [[cubic inch]] (in\u00b7lbf\u00b7in<sup>\u22123</sup>) in [[US customary units]].<br />\n1.00&nbsp;N\u00b7m.m<sup>\u22123</sup> \u2243 {{gaps|0.000|145}}&nbsp;in\u00b7{{lbf}}\u00b7in<sup>\u22123</sup> and 1.00&nbsp;in\u00b7{{lbf}}\u00b7in<sup>\u22123</sup> \u2243 6.89&nbsp;kN\u00b7m.m<sup>\u22123</sup>.\n\nIn the [[SI]] system, the unit of tensile toughness can be easily calculated by using area underneath the stress\u2013strain (''\u03c3''\u2013''\u03b5'') curve, which gives tensile toughness value, as given below:<ref>{{cite journal|author=O.Balkan and H.Demirer|title=Polym.

Toughness is related to the area under the stress-strain curve. In order to be tough, a material must be both strong and ductile. For example, brittle materials (like ceramics) that are strong but with limited ductility are not tough; conversely, very ductile materials with low strengths are also not tough. To be tough, a material should withstand both high stresses and high strains. Generally speaking, strength indicates how much force the material can support, while toughness indicates how much energy a material can absorb before rupturing.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Fracture toughness]]\n* [[Graph toughness]]\n* [[Hardness]]\n* [[Impact (mechanics)]]\n* [[Resilience (materials science)|Resilience]]\n* [[Shock (mechanics)]]\n* [[Tablet hardness testing]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Continuum mechanics]]\n[[Category:Materials science]]\n[[Category:Physical quantities]]"}]}}}}
