Common [[vernacular]] extended from their computing and telecommunication meanings and refers specifically to an [[Internet connection]]. Lastly, in the area of human interaction and conversation, discussions taking place during a business meeting are \"online\", while issues that do not concern all participants of the meeting should be \"taken offline\"\u2014continued outside of the meeting.\n\n==Definitions==\nIn computer technology and [[telecommunication]], '''online''' and '''offline''' are defined by [[Federal Standard 1037C]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015|www.rrworld.info = }} They are states or conditions of a \"device or equipment\" or of a \"[[functional unit]]\". To be considered online, one of the following may apply to a system: it is under the direct control of another device; it is under the direct control of the [[system]] with which it is associated; or it is available for immediate use on demand by the system without human intervention.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nIn contrast, a device that is offline meets none of these criteria (e.g., its main power source is disconnected or turned off, or it is off-power).\n\nThe [[Oxford dictionary]] defines \"online\" (sometimes also referenced as \"On the Line\") as \"controlled by or connected to a computer\" and as an activity or service which is \"available on or performed using the Internet or other computer network\".<ref name=ox>{{cite web|title=online|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/online|website=Dictionary of British and World English|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=31 January 2015}}</ref>  The term is utilized within terms such as these: \"[[online identity]]\", \"[[online predator]]\", \"[[online gambling]]\", \"[[online shopping]]\", \"[[online banking]]\", and \"[[E-learning|online learning]]\". The online context is given to other words by the prefixes \"cyber\" and \"e\", as in the words \"[[cyberspace]]\", \"[[cybercrime]]\", \"[[email]]\", and \"[[ecommerce]]\".<ref name=thesau>{{cite web|title=Synonyms of online in English:|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english-thesaurus/online|website=Oxford Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=31 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Antecedents==\nDuring the 19th century, the term \"on line\" was commonly used in both the railroad and telegraph industries. For railroads, a signal box would send a messages down the line (track), via a telegraph line (cable), indicating the track's status: \"Train on line\" or \"Line clear\".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nEcKAAAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA33&dq=%22train+on+line%22 |title=Great Britain Railways: Accidents. Court of Inquiry Reports |publisher= |author=Great Britain Board of Trade |year=1874 |page=33 |accessdate=April 8, 2015}}</ref> Telegraph linemen would refer to sending current through a line as \"direct on line\" or \"battery on line\";<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A4A3AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA172&dq=%22on+line%22+telegraph |title=Journal of the Society of Telegraph Engineers: Including Original Communications on Telegraphy and Electrical Science, Volume 8 |publisher= |author=Society of Telegraph Engineers |year=1879 |page=172 |accessdate=April 8, 2015}}</ref> or they may refer to a problem with the circuit as being \"on line\", as opposed to the power source or end-point equipment.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yxgAAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA47&dq=%22on+line%22+telegraph+battery |title=The practical telegraphist and guide to the telegraph service |publisher= |author=William Lynd |year=1885 |page=47 |accessdate=April 8, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n\n==={{anchor|Offline mail}}Offline email===\nOne example of a common use of these concepts with [[email]] is a [[mail user agent]] (MUA) that can be instructed to be in either online or offline states.  One such MUA is [[Microsoft Outlook]]. When online it will attempt to connect to mail servers (to check for new mail at regular intervals, for example), and when offline it will not attempt to make any such connection. The online or offline state of the MUA does not necessarily reflect the connection status between the computer on which it is running and the [[Internet]].  That is, the computer itself may be online\u2014connected to Internet via a [[cable modem]] or other means\u2014while Outlook is kept offline by the user, so that it makes no attempt to send or to receive messages. Similarly, a computer may be configured to employ a [[dial-up Internet access|dial-up connection]] on demand (as when an application such as Outlook attempts to make connection to a server), but the user may not wish for Outlook to trigger that call whenever it is configured to check for mail.<ref name=\"Mann\">{{cite book|pages=76&ndash;77|title=How to Do Everything with Microsoft Office Outlook 2003|author=Bill Mann|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|year=2003|isbn=0-07-223070-3}}</ref>\n\n===Offline media playing===\nAnother example of the use of these concepts is [[digital audio]] technology. A tape recorder, [[digital audio editor]], or other device that is online is one whose clock is under the control of the clock of a synchronization master device. When the sync master commences playback, the online device automatically synchronizes itself to the master and commences playing from the same point in the recording. A device that is offline uses no external clock reference and relies upon its own internal clock. When a large number of devices are connected to a sync master it is often convenient, if one wants to hear just the output of one single device, to take it offline because, if the device is played back online, all synchronized devices have to locate the playback point and wait for each other device to be in synchronization.<ref>{{cite book|title=Audiopro Home Recording Course: A Comprehensive Multimedia Audio Recording Text|author=Bill Gibson|pages=155|year=1998|publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=0-87288-715-4}}</ref> (For related discussion, see [[MIDI timecode]], [[word sync]], and recording system synchronization.)\n\n===Offline browsing===\n{{main|Offline browsing}}\nA third example of a common use of these concepts is a [[web browser]] that can be instructed to be in either online or offline states. The browser attempts to fetch pages from servers while only in the online state. In the offline state, users can perform '''offline browsing''', where pages can be browsed using local copies of those pages that have previously been downloaded while in the online state. This can be useful when the computer is offline and connection to the Internet is impossible or undesirable. The pages are downloaded either implicitly into the web browser's own [[browser cache|cache]] as a result of prior online browsing by the user or explicitly by a browser configured to keep local copies of certain web pages, which are updated when the browser is in the online state, either by checking that the local copies are up-to-date at regular intervals or by checking that the local copies are up-to-date whenever the browser is switched to the online state. One such web browser capable of being explicitly configured to download pages for offline browsing is [[Internet Explorer]]. When pages are added to the Favourites list, they can be marked to be \"available for offline browsing\". Internet Explorer will download to local copies both the marked page and, optionally, all of the pages that it links to. In Internet Explorer version 6, the level of direct and indirect links, the maximum amount of local disc space allowed to be consumed, and the schedule on which local copies are checked to see whether they are up-to-date, are configurable for each individual Favourites entry.<ref>{{cite book|title=Good Web Guide|author=Arabella Dymoke|year=2004|publisher=The Good Web Guide Ltd|isbn=1-903282-46-2|pages=17|chapter=an a to z of internet terms}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Wireless Computing and Networking|author=Paul Heltzel|chapter=Wireless Road Tricks|year=2002|publisher=Alpha Books|isbn=0-02-864287-2|pages=205}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Internet Companion: The Easy Australian Guide|author1=Glen Waller  |author2=Vanessa Waller |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2000|publisher=UNSW Press|isbn=0-86840-499-3|pages=110&ndash;112}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Configuring and Troubleshooting Windows XP Professional|author=Brian Barber|year=2001|publisher=Syngress Publishing|isbn=1-928994-80-6|pages=285&ndash;389|chapter=Configuring Internet Technologies}}</ref>\n\nFor communities that lack adequate Internet connectivity\u2014such as developing countries, rural areas, and prisons\u2014offline information stores such as the [[eGranary]] Digital Library (a collection of approximately thirty million educational resources from more than two thousand web sites and hundreds of CD-ROMs) provide offline access to information.  Numerous organizations have developed, or are developing, flash memory chips with collections of educational materials for offline use in smartphones, tablets, and laptops.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n===Offline storage===\nLikewise, [[offline storage]] is [[computer data storage]] that is not \"available for immediate use on demand by the system without human intervention.\" Additionally, an otherwise online system that is powered down may be considered offline.\n\n===Offline messages===\nWith the growing communication tools and media, the words offline and online are used very frequently. If a person is active over a messaging tool and is able to accept the messages it is termed as online message and if the person is not available and the message is left to view when the person is back, it is termed as offline message. In the same context, the person's availability is termed as online and non availability is termed as offline\n\n==Generalizations==\nOnline and offline distinctions have been generalized from computing and telecommunication into the field of human interpersonal relationships. The distinction between what is considered online and what is considered offline has become a subject of study in the field of [[sociology]].<ref name=Slater>{{cite book|chapter=Social Relationships and Identity On-line and Off-line|title=Handbook of New Media: Social Shaping and Consequences of ICTs|editors=Leah, Sonia, Lievrouw, and Livingstone|author=Don Slater|pages=533&ndash;543|year=2002|publisher=Sage Publications Inc|isbn=0-7619-6510-6}}</ref>\n\nThe distinction between online and offline is conventionally seen as the distinction between [[computer-mediated communication]] and [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]] communication (e.g., [[face time]]), respectively. Online is virtuality or [[cyberspace]], and offline is reality (i.e., [[Real life (reality)|Real life]] or [[meatspace]]). Slater states that this distinction is \"obviously far too simple\".<ref name=Slater /> To support his argument that the distinctions in relationships are more complex than a simple dichotomy of online versus offline, he observes that some people draw no distinction between an online relationship, such as indulging in [[cybersex]], and an offline relationship, such as being [[pen pal]]s.  He argues that even the [[telephone]] can be regarded as an online experience in some circumstances, and that the blurring of the distinctions between the uses of various technologies (such as [[personal digital assistant|PDA]] versus [[mobile phone]], [[Internet television]] versus [[Internet]], and [[telephone]] versus [[Voice over Internet Protocol]]) has made it \"impossible to use the term ''online'' meaningfully in the sense that was employed by the first generation of Internet research\".<ref name=Slater />\n\nSlater asserts that there are legal and regulatory pressures to reduce the distinction between online and offline, with a \"general tendency to assimilate online to offline and erase the distinction,\" stressing, however, that this does not mean that online relationships are being reduced to ''pre-existing'' offline relationships. He conjectures that greater legal status may be assigned to online relationships (pointing out that contractual relationships, such as business transactions, online are already seen as just as \"real\" as their offline counterparts), although he states it to be hard to imagine courts awarding [[palimony]] to people who have had a purely online sexual relationship. He also conjectures that an online/offline distinction may be seen by people as \"rather quaint and not quite comprehensible\" within 10 years.<ref name=Slater />\n\nThis distinction between ''online'' and ''offline'' is sometimes inverted, with online concepts being used to define and to explain offline activities, rather than (as per the conventions of the [[desktop metaphor]] with its desktops, trash cans, folders, and so forth) the other way around. Several cartoons appearing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' have satirized this. One includes [[Saint Peter]] asking for a username and a password before admitting a man into Heaven. Another illustrates \"the off-line store\" where \"All items are actual size!\", shoppers may \"Take it home as soon as you pay for it!\", and \"Merchandise may be handled prior to purchase!\"<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Introduction|title=Evolve: Succeeding in the digital culture of tomorrow|author=Rosabeth Moss Kanter|year=2001|publisher=Harvard Business School|isbn=1-57851-439-8}}</ref><ref>[http://executiveeducation.wharton.upenn.edu/ebuzz/0508/images/cartoon2.jpg The \"off-line store\" cartoon from ''The New Yorker'']</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Wiktionary|offline|online|come online}}\n{{div col| cols=2}}\n*[[Computer networking]]\n*[[NLS (computer system)|NLS]], or the \"oN-Line System\"\n*[[Offline reader]]\n*[[On the fly#Computer usage|On the fly \u00a7 Computer usage]]\n*[[Online algorithm]]\n*[[Online algorithm|Online and offline algorithms]]\n*[[Online editing]] and [[offline editing]] \u2013 the online/offline distinction in [[video editing]]\n*[[Online game]]s\n*[[Online identity]]\n*[[Online (magazine)|''Online'' (magazine)]]\n*[[Online volunteering]]\n*[[Open access (publishing)]]\n*[[Reputation]]\n*[[Website mirroring software]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist | 30em}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{FS1037C MS188}}\n{{refend}}\n\n[[Category:Computer jargon]]\n[[Category:Internet terminology]]"}]}}}}
