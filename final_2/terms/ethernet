As with other [[IEEE 802]] LANs, each Ethernet station is given a 48-bit [[MAC address]]. The MAC addresses are used to specify both the destination and the source of each data packet. Ethernet establishes link level connections, which can be defined using both the destination and source addresses. On reception of a transmission, the receiver uses the destination address to determine whether the transmission is relevant to the station or should be ignored. Network interfaces normally do not accept packets addressed to other Ethernet stations. Adapters come programmed with a globally unique address.{{Efn|In some cases, the factory-assigned address can be overridden, either to avoid an address change when an adapter is replaced or to use locally administered addresses.}}\n\nAn [[EtherType]] field in each frame is used by the operating system on the receiving station to select the appropriate protocol module (e.g., an [[Internet Protocol]] version such as [[IPv4]]).

A scheme known as [[carrier sense multiple access with collision detection]] (CSMA/CD) governed the way the computers shared the channel. This scheme was simpler than the competing [[token ring]] or [[token bus]] technologies.{{Efn|In a CSMA/CD system packets must be large enough to guarantee that the leading edge of the propagating wave of the message gets to all parts of the medium and back again before the transmitter stops transmitting, guaranteeing that [[collisions]] (two or more packets initiated within a window of time that forced them to overlap) are discovered. As a result, the minimum packet size and the physical medium's total length are closely linked.}} Computers are connected to an [[Attachment Unit Interface]] (AUI) [[transceiver]], which is in turn connected to the cable (with [[thin Ethernet]] the transceiver is integrated into the network adapter). While a simple passive wire is highly reliable for small networks, it is not reliable for large extended networks, where damage to the wire in a single place, or a single bad connector, can make the whole Ethernet segment unusable.{{Efn|Multipoint systems are also prone to strange failure modes when an electrical discontinuity reflects the signal in such a manner that some nodes would work properly, while others work slowly because of excessive retries or not at all. See [[standing wave]] for an explanation. These could be much more difficult to diagnose than a complete failure of the segment.}}\n\nThrough the first half of the 1980s, Ethernet's [[10BASE5]] implementation used a coaxial cable {{convert|0.375|in}} in diameter, later called \"thick Ethernet\" or \"thicknet\". Its successor, [[10BASE2]], called \"thin Ethernet\" or \"thinnet\", used the [[RG-58]] coaxial cable.

They corrupt transmitted data and require stations to retransmit. The lost data and retransmissions reduce throughput. In the worst case where multiple active hosts connected with maximum allowed cable length attempt to transmit many short frames, excessive collisions can reduce throughput dramatically. However, a [[Xerox]] report in 1980 studied performance of an existing Ethernet installation under both normal and artificially generated heavy load.

In this topology, collisions are only possible if station and switch attempt to communicate with each other at the same time, and collisions are limited to this link. Furthermore, the [[10BASE-T]] standard introduced a [[full duplex]] mode of operation which has become extremely common. In full duplex, switch and station can communicate with each other simultaneously, and therefore modern Ethernets are completely collision-free.\n\n===Repeaters and hubs===\n[[Image:Network card.jpg|thumb|A 1990s [[network card|network interface card]] supporting both [[coaxial cable]]-based [[10BASE2]] ([[BNC connector]], left) and twisted pair-based [[Ethernet over twisted pair|10BASE-T]] ([[8P8C]] connector, right)]]{{Main article|Ethernet hub}}\nFor signal degradation and timing reasons, coaxial [[Ethernet segment]]s have a restricted size.

In 1987 [[SynOptics]] introduced the first twisted-pair Ethernet at 10&nbsp;Mbit/s in a star-wired cabling topology with a central hub, later called [[LattisNet]].<ref name=VonBurg2003/><ref>\n   {{cite book\n   |title = Ethernet; The Definitive Guide\n   |publisher=O'Reilly\n   |author=Spurgeon, Charles E.\n   |year = 2000\n   |isbn = 1-56592-660-9\n   |series = Nutshell Handbook\n   |page = 29\n   |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MRChaUQr0Q0C&pg=PA20&lpg=PA20&dq=synoptics+unshielded+twisted+pair#v=onepage&q=synoptics&f=false\n   }}\n</ref><ref>\n   {{cite book\n   | title = The Triumph of Ethernet: technological communities and the battle for the LAN standard\n   | author=Urs von Burg\n   | publisher=Stanford University Press |year= 2001\n   |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ooBqdIXIqbwC&pg=PA175\n   | isbn = 0-8047-4094-1\n   | page = 175\n   }}\n</ref> These evolved into 10BASE-T, which was designed for point-to-point links only, and all termination was built into the device. This changed repeaters from a specialist device used at the center of large networks to a device that every twisted pair-based network with more than two machines had to use. The tree structure that resulted from this made Ethernet networks easier to maintain by preventing most faults with one peer or its associated cable from affecting other devices on the network.\n\nDespite the physical star topology and the presence of separate transmit and receive channels in the twisted pair and fiber media, repeater-based Ethernet networks still use half-duplex and CSMA/CD, with only minimal activity by the repeater, primarily generation of the [[jam signal]] in dealing with packet collisions. Every packet is sent to every other port on the repeater, so bandwidth and security problems are not addressed. The total throughput of the repeater is limited to that of a single link, and all links must operate at the same speed.\n\n===Bridging and switching===<!--[[Full-duplex Ethernet]] redirects here-->\n[[File:Network switches.jpg|thumb|[[Patch cable]]s with [[patch field]]s of two Ethernet switches]]\n{{Main article|Ethernet switch|Bridging (networking)|}}\nWhile repeaters can isolate some aspects of [[Ethernet segment]]s, such as cable breakages, they still forward all traffic to all Ethernet devices. This creates practical limits on how many machines can communicate on an Ethernet network. The entire network is one [[collision domain]], and all hosts have to be able to detect collisions anywhere on the network. This limits the number of repeaters between the farthest nodes. Segments joined by repeaters have to all operate at the same speed, making phased-in upgrades impossible.\n\nTo alleviate these problems, bridging was created to communicate at the data link layer while isolating the physical layer. With bridging, only well-formed Ethernet packets are forwarded from one Ethernet segment to another; collisions and packet errors are isolated. At initial startup, Ethernet bridges (and switches) work somewhat like Ethernet repeaters, passing all traffic between segments. By observing the source addresses of incoming frames, the bridge then builds an address table associating addresses to segments. Once an address is learned, the bridge forwards network traffic destined for that address only to the associated segment, improving overall performance. [[broadcasting (networking)|Broadcast]] traffic is still forwarded to all network segments. Bridges also overcome the limits on total segments between two hosts and allow the mixing of speeds, both of which are critical to deployment of [[Fast Ethernet]].\n\nIn 1989, the networking company [[Kalpana (company)|Kalpana]] (acquired by [[Cisco Systems|Cisco Systems, Inc.]] in 1994) introduced their EtherSwitch, the first Ethernet switch.{{Efn|The term ''switch'' was invented by device manufacturers and does not appear in the 802.3 standard.}} This works somewhat differently from an Ethernet bridge, where only the header of the incoming packet is examined before it is either dropped or forwarded to another segment.  This greatly reduces the forwarding latency and the processing load on the network device. One drawback of this [[cut-through switching]] method is that packets that have been corrupted are still propagated through the network, so a jabbering station can continue to disrupt the entire network.  The eventual remedy for this was a return to the original [[store and forward]] approach of bridging, where the packet would be read into a buffer on the switch in its entirety, verified against its checksum and then forwarded, but using more powerful [[application-specific integrated circuit]]s. Hence, the bridging is then done in hardware, allowing packets to be forwarded at full wire speed.\n\nWhen a twisted pair or fiber link segment is used and neither end is connected to a repeater, [[full-duplex]] Ethernet becomes possible over that segment.  In full-duplex mode, both devices can transmit and receive to and from each other at the same time, and there is no collision domain.  This doubles the aggregate bandwidth of the link and is sometimes advertised as double the link speed (for example, 200&nbsp;Mbit/s).{{Efn|This is misleading, as performance will double only if traffic patterns are symmetrical.}} The elimination of the collision domain for these connections also means that all the link's bandwidth can be used by the two devices on that segment and that segment length is not limited by the need for correct collision detection.\n\nSince packets are typically delivered only to the port they are intended for, traffic on a switched Ethernet is less public than on shared-medium Ethernet. <span id=\"switch_vulnerabilities\">Despite this, switched Ethernet should still be regarded as an insecure network technology, because it is easy to subvert switched Ethernet systems by means such as [[ARP spoofing]] and [[MAC flooding]].</span>\n\nThe bandwidth advantages, the improved isolation of devices from each other, the ability to easily mix different speeds of devices and the elimination of the chaining limits inherent in non-switched Ethernet have made switched Ethernet the dominant network technology.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cisco.com/en/US/solutions/collateral/ns340/ns394/ns74/ns149/net_business_benefit09186a00800c92b9_ps6600_Products_White_Paper.html |quote=Respondents were first asked about their current and planned desktop LAN attachment standards.
