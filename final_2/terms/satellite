Such objects are sometimes called '''artificial satellites''' to distinguish them from [[natural satellite]]s such as Earth's [[Moon]].\n\nThe world's first artificial satellite, the [[Sputnik 1]], was launched by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1957. Since then, thousands of satellites have been launched into orbit around the [[Earth]]. Some satellites, notably [[space station]]s, have been launched in parts and assembled in orbit. Artificial satellites originate from more than 40 countries and have used the satellite launching capabilities of ten nations. About a thousand satellites are currently operational, whereas thousands of unused satellites and satellite fragments orbit the Earth as [[space debris]]. A few [[space probe]]s have been placed into orbit around other bodies and become artificial satellites to the Moon, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[4 Vesta|Vesta]], [[433 Eros|Eros]], [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/press/2015/march/nasa-spacecraft-becomes-first-to-orbit-a-dwarf-planet/#.VPtPWbYrvcs|title=NASA Spacecraft Becomes First to Orbit a Dwarf Planet|work=NASA}}</ref> and the [[Sun]].\n\nSatellites are used for a large number of purposes. Common types include military and civilian Earth observation satellites, [[communications satellite]]s, [[navigation satellites]], [[weather satellites]], and [[research satellites]]. Space stations and human [[spacecraft]] in orbit are also satellites. Satellite orbits vary greatly, depending on the purpose of the satellite, and are classified in a number of ways. Well-known (overlapping) classes include [[low Earth orbit]], [[polar orbit]], and [[geostationary orbit]].\n\nAbout 6,600 satellites have been launched. The latest estimates are that 3,600 remain in orbit.<ref name=AP-Rising-11-13>{{cite news|last=Rising |first=David |title=Satellite hits Atlantic \u2014 but what about next one? |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2022236028_apxfallingsatellite.html |newspaper=Seattle Times |date=11 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112013308/http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2022236028_apxfallingsatellite.html |archivedate=2013-11-12 }}</ref>  Of those, about 1,000 are operational;<ref name=ESA>{{cite web | title=Global Experts Agree Action Needed on Space Debris | url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Debris/Global_experts_agree_action_needed_on_space_debris | work= | publisher=European Space Agency | date=25 April 2013 | deadurl=no | archiveurl= | archivedate= }}</ref><ref name=UCS-SatDB>{{cite web | title=UCS Satellite Database | url=http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear_weapons_and_global_security/space_weapons/technical_issues/ucs-satellite-database.html | work=UCS Satellite Database | publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists | date= | deadurl=no | archiveurl= | archivedate= | accessdate=2013-11-12 }}</ref> the rest have lived out their useful lives and are part of the [[space debris]].

Usually the [[launch vehicle]] itself is a rocket lifting off from a [[launch pad]] on land. In a minority of cases satellites are launched at sea (from a [[Submarine-based launch vehicle|submarine]] or a [[Sea Launch|mobile maritime platform]]) or aboard a plane (see [[air launch to orbit]]).\n\nSatellites are usually semi-independent computer-controlled systems. Satellite subsystems attend many tasks, such as power generation, [[Spacecraft thermal control|thermal control]], telemetry, [[attitude control]] and orbit control.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early conceptions ===\n\"[[Newton's cannonball]]\", presented as a \"thought experiment\" in ''[[A Treatise of the System of the World]]'', by [[Isaac Newton]] was the first published mathematical study of the possibility of an artificial satellite.\n\nThe first fictional depiction of a satellite being launched into orbit is a [[short story]] by [[Edward Everett Hale]], ''[[The Brick Moon]]''.

This became known as [[Project Vanguard]]. On July 31, the Soviets announced that they intended to launch a satellite by the fall of 1957.\n\nFollowing pressure by the [[American Rocket Society]], the [[National Science Foundation]], and the International Geophysical Year, military interest picked up and in early 1955 the Army and Navy were working on [[Project Orbiter]], two competing programs: the army's which involved using a [[Jupiter-C IRBM|Jupiter C rocket]], and the civilian/Navy Vanguard Rocket, to launch a satellite. At first, they failed: initial preference was given to the Vanguard program, whose first attempt at orbiting a satellite resulted in the explosion of the launch vehicle on national television. But finally, three months after Sputnik 2, the project succeeded; [[Explorer 1]] became the United States' first artificial satellite on January 31, 1958.<ref>{{cite news | title=50th anniversary of first U.S. satellite launch celebrated | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/01/30/state/n151715S68.DTL | agency=[[Associated Press]] | first=Alicia | last=Chang | work= | publisher=SFGate | date=30 January 2008 | deadurl=yes | archivedate=2008-02-01 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201193510/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/01/30/state/n151715S68.DTL }}</ref>\n\nIn June 1961, three-and-a-half years after the launch of Sputnik 1, the Air Force used resources of the [[United States Space Surveillance Network]] to catalog 115 Earth-orbiting satellites.<ref>{{cite web | first=David S.

These orbits occur at a radius of 24,360 [[gigametre|Gm]] (0.1628 [[Astronomical unit|AU]]) around the Sun, a little less than half of the [[orbital radius]] of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].\n\n===Special classifications===\n* '''[[Sun-synchronous orbit]]''': An orbit which combines altitude and inclination in such a way that the satellite passes over any given point of the planets' surface at the same local [[solar time]]. Such an orbit can place a satellite in constant sunlight and is useful for [[Satellite imagery|imaging]], [[spy satellite|spy]], and [[weather satellite]]s.\n* '''[[Moon orbit]]''': The [[Orbital parameters|orbital characteristics]] of Earth's Moon.

See asteroids [[3753 Cruithne|3753]] (Cruithne) and [[2002 AA29|2002 AA<sub>29</sub>]].\n* '''[[Exo-orbit]]''': A maneuver where a spacecraft approaches the height of orbit but lacks the velocity to sustain it.\n** '''[[Suborbital spaceflight]]''': A synonym for exo-orbit.\n* '''[[Lunar transfer orbit]] (LTO)'''\n* '''[[Prograde orbit]]''': An orbit with an inclination of less than 90\u00b0. Or rather, an orbit that is in the same direction as the rotation of the primary.\n* '''[[Retrograde orbit]]''': An orbit with an inclination of more than 90\u00b0. Or rather, an orbit counter to the direction of rotation of the planet. Apart from those in [[sun-synchronous orbit]], few satellites are launched into retrograde orbit because the quantity of fuel required to launch them is much greater than for a prograde orbit. This is because when the rocket starts out on the ground, it already has an eastward component of velocity equal to the rotational velocity of the planet at its launch [[latitude]].\n*'''[[Halo orbit]]''' and '''[[Lissajous orbit]]''': Orbits \"around\" [[Lagrangian point]]s.\n\n==Satellite subsystems==\nThe satellite's functional versatility is imbedded within its technical components and its operations characteristics. Looking at the \"anatomy\" of a typical satellite, one discovers two modules.<ref name=Grant&Meadows /> Note that some novel architectural concepts such as [[Fractionated spacecraft]] somewhat upset this taxonomy.\n\n===Spacecraft bus or service module===\nThe [[Spacecraft bus|bus module]] consists of the following subsystems:\n\n====Structural subsystem====\nThe structural subsystem provides the mechanical base structure with adequate stiffness to withstand stress and vibrations experienced during launch, maintain [[structural integrity]] and stability while on station in orbit, and shields the satellite from extreme temperature changes and [[micro-meteorite]] damage.\n\n====Telemetry subsystem====\nThe [[telemetry]] subsystem (aka Command and Data Handling, C&DH) monitors the on-board equipment operations, transmits equipment operation data to the earth control station, and receives the earth control station's commands to perform equipment operation adjustments.\n\n====Power subsystem====\nThe power subsystem consists of solar panels to convert solar energy into electrical power, regulation and distribution functions, and batteries that store power and supply the satellite when it passes into the Earth's shadow. Nuclear power sources ([[Radioisotope thermoelectric generator]] have also been used in several successful satellite programs including the [[Nimbus program]] (1964\u20131978).<ref>{{cite web | title=Radioisotope-based Nuclear Power Strategy for Exploration Systems Development | url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/schmidtstaif06.pdf | format=PDF | first=George | last=Schmidt | first2=Mike | last2=Houts | work=STAIF Nuclear Symposium | publisher=[[Marshall Space Flight Center]] | date=16 February 2006 | deadurl=no | archiveurl= | archivedate= }}</ref>\n\n====Thermal control subsystem====\n{{Main article|Spacecraft thermal control}}\nThe thermal control subsystem helps protect electronic equipment from extreme temperatures due to intense sunlight or the lack of sun exposure on different sides of the satellite's body (e.g. [[Optical Solar Reflector]])\n\n====Attitude and orbit control subsystem====\n{{Main article|Attitude control|Spacecraft propulsion}}\nThe attitude and orbit control subsystem consists of sensors to measure vehicle orientation; control laws embedded in the flight software; and actuators (reaction wheels, [[Spacecraft propulsion|thrusters]]) to apply the [[torque]]s and forces needed to re-orient the vehicle to a desired attitude, keep the satellite in the correct orbital position and keep antennas positioning in the right directions.\n\n===Communication payload===\nThe second major module is the communication payload, which is made up of transponders. A transponder is capable of :\n* Receiving [[uplink]]ed radio signals from earth satellite transmission stations (antennas).\n* Amplifying received radio signals\n* Sorting the input signals and directing the output signals through input/output signal [[multiplexer]]s to the proper [[downlink]] antennas for retransmission to earth satellite receiving stations (antennas).\n\n==End of life==\nWhen satellites reach the end of their mission, satellite operators have the option of de-orbiting the satellite, leaving the satellite in its current orbit or moving the satellite to a [[graveyard orbit]]. Historically, due to budgetary constraints at the beginning of satellite missions, satellites were rarely designed to be de-orbited. One example of this practice is the satellite [[Vanguard 1]]. Launched in 1958, [[Vanguard 1]], the 4th manmade satellite put in Geocentric orbit, was still in orbit as of August 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://169.253.2.103/oes/search/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.display |title=U.S. Space Objects Registry |work= |publisher= |date= }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nInstead of being de-orbited, most satellites are either left in their current orbit or moved to a [[graveyard orbit]].<ref>\n{{cite web \n| url=http://www.tethers.com/OrbitalDebris.html\n| title=Conventional Disposal Method: Rockets and Graveyard Orbits | work= \n| publisher=Tethers | date= | deadurl=no | archiveurl= | archivedate= }}</ref> As of 2002, the FCC requires all geostationary satellites to commit to moving to a graveyard orbit at the end of their operational life prior to launch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/spacenews/businessmonday_040628.html |title=FCC Enters Orbital Debris Debate |work= |publisher=Space.com |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724183455/http://www.space.com/spacenews/businessmonday_040628.html |archivedate=2009-07-24 }}</ref> In cases of uncontrolled de-orbiting, the major variable is the [[solar flux]], and the minor variables the components and form factors of the satellite itself, and the gravitational perturbations generated by the Sun and the Moon (as well as those exercised by large mountain ranges, whether above or below sea level).

It is common for Earth stations to transmit at the wrong time or on the wrong frequency in commercial satellite space, and dual-illuminate the transponder, rendering the frequency unusable. Satellite operators now have sophisticated monitoring that enables them to pinpoint the source of any carrier and manage the transponder space effectively. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\n==Satellite services==\n{{Div col||30em}}\n* [[Satellite crop monitoring]]\n* [[Satellite Internet access]]\n* [[Satellite navigation]]\n* [[Satellite phone]]\n* [[Satellite radio]]\n* [[Satellite television]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal| Spaceflight }}\n{{Div col||30em}}\n*[[2009 satellite collision]]\n*[[Atmospheric satellite]]\n*[[Fractionated spacecraft]]\n*[[Imagery intelligence]]\n*[[International Designator]]\n*[[List of communications satellite firsts]]\n*[[List of Earth observation satellites]]\n*[[List of passive satellites]]\n*[[Satellite Catalog Number]]\n*[[Satellite formation flying]]\n*[[Satellite watching]]\n*[[Space exploration]]\n*[[Space probe]]\n*[[Spaceport]] (including list of spaceports)\n*[[U.S. space exploration history on U.S. stamps|Satellites on stamps]]\n*[[USA-193]] (2008 American anti-satellite missile test)\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{commons category|Satellites}}\n* {{dmoz|Business/Telecommunications/Services/Wireless/Satellite/|Satellite}}\n* [http://en.satellite.tracks.free.fr/ Satellite Ground Tracks] Real time satellite tracks (Full catalog of satellite orbit). {{en icon}} {{de icon}} {{es icon}} {{fr icon}} {{it icon}} {{pt icon}} {{zh icon}}\n* [http://www.n2yo.com/ Real Time Satellite Tracking] provides real-time tracks for about 17000 satellites, as well as 5-day predictions of visibility\n* [http://www.heavens-above.com/ Heavens Above] provides 10-day predictions of satellite visibility\n* [http://www.satflare.com/ Satflare] tracks in real time all the satellites orbiting the Earth\n* [http://www.vega.org.uk/video/programme/12 'Eyes in the Sky' Free video by the Vega Science Trust and the BBC/OU] Satellites and their implications over the last 50 years.\n{{Space-based meteorological observation}}\n{{Spaceflight}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Satellites| ]]\n[[Category:Meteorological data and networks]]\n[[Category:Remote sensing]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Unmanned spacecraft]]"}]}}}}
