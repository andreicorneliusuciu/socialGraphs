When the fluid is forced through a tube, the particles which compose the fluid generally move more quickly near the tube's axis and more slowly near its walls; therefore some [[stress (physics)|stress]] (such as a [[pressure]] difference between the two ends of the tube) is needed to overcome the friction between particle layers to keep the fluid moving. For a given velocity pattern, the stress required is proportional to the fluid's viscosity.\n\nA fluid that has no resistance to shear stress is known as an ''ideal'' or ''inviscid'' fluid. Zero viscosity is observed only at [[cryogenics|very low temperatures]] in [[Superfluidity|superfluids]]. Otherwise, all fluids have positive viscosity, and are technically said to be viscous or viscid.  In common parlance, however, a liquid is said to be ''viscous'' if its viscosity is substantially greater than that of water, and may be described as ''mobile'' if the viscosity is noticeably less than water. A fluid with a relatively high viscosity, such as [[pitch (resin)|pitch]], may appear to be a [[solid]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"viscosity\" is derived from the [[Latin]] \"''{{lang|la|viscum}}''\", meaning [[mistletoe]] and also a viscous [[glue]] made from mistletoe berries.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=viscous |title=viscous |website=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2010-09-14}}</ref>\n\n==Definition==\n\n=== Dynamic (shear) viscosity {{anchor|Dynamic viscosity}} ===\n[[File:Laminar shear.svg|thumb|right|320px|Laminar shear of fluid between two plates. Friction between the fluid and the moving boundaries causes the fluid to shear. The force required for this action is a measure of the fluid's viscosity.]]\n[[File:Laminar shear flow.svg|thumb|right|320px|In a general parallel flow (such as could occur in a straight pipe), the shear stress is proportional to the gradient of the velocity]]\n\nThe dynamic (shear) viscosity of a fluid expresses its resistance to shearing flows, where adjacent layers move parallel to each other with different speeds. It can be defined through the idealized situation known as a [[Couette flow]], where a layer of fluid is trapped between two horizontal plates, one fixed and one moving horizontally at constant speed <math>u</math>. This fluid has to be homogeneous in the layer and at different shear stresses. (The plates are assumed to be very large, so that one need not consider what happens near their edges.)\n\nIf the speed of the top plate is small enough, the fluid particles will move [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to it, and their speed will vary [[linear function|linearly]] from zero at the bottom to {{mvar|u}} at the top.  Each layer of fluid will move faster than the one just below it, and friction between them will give rise to a [[force (physics)|force]] resisting their relative motion.  In particular, the fluid will apply on the top plate a force in the direction opposite to its motion, and an equal but opposite one to the bottom plate. An external force is therefore required in order to keep the top plate moving at constant speed.\n\nThe magnitude {{mvar|F}} of this force is found to be proportional to the speed {{mvar|u}} and the area {{mvar|A}} of each plate, and inversely proportional to their separation {{mvar|y}}: \n:<math> F=\\mu A \\frac{u}{y}.</math>\nThe proportionality factor {{mvar|\u03bc}} in this formula is the viscosity (specifically, the ''dynamic viscosity'') of the fluid.\n\nThe ratio {{mvar|{{sfrac|u|y}}}} is called the ''rate of shear deformation'' or ''[[shear velocity]]'', and is the [[derivative]] of the fluid speed in the direction [[perpendicular]] to the plates.  [[Isaac Newton]] expressed the viscous forces by the [[differential equation]]\n:<math>\\tau=\\mu \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y},</math>\nwhere {{math|1=''\u03c4'' = ''{{sfrac|F|A}}''}}, and {{math|{{sfrac|\u2202''u''|\u2202''y''}}}} is the local shear velocity.  This formula assumes that the flow is moving along parallel lines and the {{mvar|y}}-axis, perpendicular to the flow, points in the direction of maximum shear velocity.  This equation can be used where the velocity does not vary linearly with {{mvar|y}}, such as in fluid flowing through a pipe.\n\nUse of the [[mu (letter)|Greek letter mu]] ({{mvar|\u03bc}}) for the dynamic stress viscosity is common among mechanical and chemical engineers, as well as physicists.<ref>{{cite book|last=Streeter|first=Victor Lyle|last2=Wylie|first2=E.

It is usually denoted by the [[Nu (letter)|Greek letter nu]] ({{mvar|\u03bd}}). \n: <math>\\nu = \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho}</math>\nIt is a convenient concept when analyzing the [[Reynolds number]], which expresses the ratio of the [[inertia]]l forces to the viscous forces:\n: <math>\\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{\\rho u L}{\\mu} = \\frac{uL}{\\nu} ,</math>\nwhere {{mvar|L}} is a typical length scale in the system.\n\n=== Bulk viscosity ===\nWhen a [[compressible fluid]] is compressed or expanded evenly, without shear, it may still exhibit a form of internal friction that resists its flow. These forces are related to the rate of compression or expansion by a factor called the [[volume viscosity]], bulk viscosity or second viscosity.\n\nThe bulk viscosity is important only when the fluid is being rapidly compressed or expanded, such as in [[sound]] and [[shock wave]]s.  Bulk viscosity explains the loss of energy in those waves, as described by [[Stokes' law (sound attenuation)|Stokes' law of sound attenuation]].\n\n===Viscosity tensor===\n{{Main|Viscous stress tensor}}\n\nIn general, the [[stress (mechanics)|stresses]] within a flow can be attributed partly to the [[deformation (mechanics)|deformation]] of the material from some rest state ([[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] stress), and partly to the [[strain rate|rate of change of the deformation]] over time (viscous stress).  In a fluid, by definition, the elastic stress includes only the [[hydrostatic pressure]].\n\nIn very general terms, the fluid's viscosity is the relation between the strain rate and the viscous stress.  In the [[Newtonian fluid]] model, the relationship is by definition a linear map, described by a viscosity tensor that, multiplied by the [[strain rate tensor]] (which is the [[gradient]] of the flow's velocity), gives the viscous stress tensor.\n\nThe viscosity tensor has nine independent [[degrees of freedom]] in general. For [[isotropic]] Newtonian fluids, these can be reduced to two independent parameters. The most usual decomposition yields the stress viscosity {{mvar|\u03bc}} and the bulk viscosity {{mvar|\u03c3}}.\n\n==Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids==\n[[File:Viscous regimes chart.png|thumb|right|320px|Viscosity, the slope of each line, varies among materials]]\n\nNewton's law of viscosity is a [[constitutive equation]] (like [[Hooke's law]], [[Fick's law]], [[Ohm's law]]): it is not a fundamental law of nature but an approximation that holds in some materials and fails in others.\n\nA fluid that behaves according to Newton's law, with a viscosity {{mvar|\u03bc}} that is independent of the stress, is said to be [[Newtonian fluid|Newtonian]].  [[Gas]]es, [[water]], and many common liquids can be considered Newtonian in ordinary conditions and contexts.  There are many [[non-Newtonian fluid]]s that significantly deviate from that law in some way or other. For example:\n\n*[[Shear thickening|Shear-thickening]] liquids, whose viscosity increases with the rate of shear strain.\n*[[Shear thinning|Shear-thinning]] liquids, whose viscosity decreases with the rate of shear strain.\n*[[Thixotropic]] liquids, that become less viscous over time when shaken, agitated, or otherwise stressed.\n*[[Rheopectic]] liquids, that become more viscous over time when shaken, agitated, or otherwise stressed.\n*[[Bingham plastic]]s that behave as a solid at low stresses but flow as a viscous fluid at high stresses.\n\nShear-thinning liquids are very commonly, but misleadingly, described as thixotropic.\n\nEven for a Newtonian fluid, the viscosity usually depends on its composition and temperature.  For gases and other [[compressible fluid]]s, it depends on temperature and varies very slowly with pressure.\n\nThe viscosity of some fluids may depend on other factors. A [[magnetorheological fluid]], for example, becomes thicker when subjected to a [[magnetic field]], possibly to the point of behaving like a solid.\n\n==Viscosity in solids==\nThe viscous forces that arise during fluid flow must not be confused with the [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] forces that arise in a solid in response to shear, compression or extension stresses.  While in the latter the stress is proportional to the ''amount'' of shear deformation, in a fluid it is proportional to the ''rate'' of deformation over time.  (For this reason, [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] used the term ''fugitive elasticity'' for fluid viscosity.)\n\nHowever, many liquids (including water) will briefly react like elastic solids when subjected to sudden stress. Conversely, many \"solids\" (even [[granite]]) will flow like liquids, albeit very slowly, even under arbitrarily small stress.<ref>{{cite journal\n |last = Kumagai\n |first = Naoichi\n |first2=Sadao |last2=Sasajima |first3=Hidebumi |last3=Ito\n |title = Long-term Creep of Rocks: Results with Large Specimens Obtained in about 20 Years and Those with Small Specimens in about 3 Years\n |journal = Journal of the Society of Materials Science (Japan)\n |volume = 27\n |issue = 293\n |pages = 157\u2013161\n |publisher = Japan Energy Society\n |url = https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ja&u=http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110002299397/&sa=X&oi=translate&resnum=4&ct=result&prev=/search%3Fq%3DIto%2BHidebumi%26hl%3Den\n |date = 15 February 1978\n |accessdate = 2008-06-16}}</ref>  Such materials are therefore best described as possessing both elasticity (reaction to deformation) and viscosity (reaction to rate of deformation); that is, being [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]].\n\nIndeed, some authors have claimed that [[amorphous solid]]s, such as [[glass]] and many [[polymers]], are actually liquids with a very high viscosity (greater than 10<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Pa\u00b7s).\n<!--<ref>[http://web.umr.edu/~brow/PDF_viscosity.pdf The Properties of Glass ], page 6, retrieved on August 1, 2007</ref>--><ref name=r1>{{cite web|url=http://physics.info/viscosity/|work=The Physics Hypertextbook| last=Elert|first=Glenn|title=Viscosity}}</ref> However, other authors dispute this hypothesis, claiming instead that there is some threshold for the stress, below which most solids will not flow at all,<ref>{{cite web|last = Gibbs\n|first = Philip\n|title = Is Glass a Liquid or a Solid?\n|url = http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/Glass/glass.html\n|accessdate = 2007-07-31}}</ref> and that alleged instances of glass flow in window panes of old buildings are due to the crude manufacturing process of older eras rather than to the viscosity of glass.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ed066p994|url=http://dwb.unl.edu/Teacher/NSF/C01/C01Links/www.ualberta.ca/~bderksen/windowpane.html|title=Antique windowpanes and the flow of supercooled liquids|date=1989|last1=Plumb|first1=Robert C.|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|volume=66|issue=12|pages=994|bibcode = 1989JChEd..66..994P }}</ref>\n\nViscoelastic solids may exhibit both shear viscosity and bulk viscosity.

The fluids without a constant viscosity ([[non-Newtonian fluid]]s) cannot be described by a single number. Non-Newtonian fluids exhibit a variety of different correlations between shear stress and shear rate.\n\nOne of the most common instruments for measuring kinematic viscosity is the glass capillary viscometer.\n\nIn [[coating]] industries, viscosity may be measured with a cup in which the [[efflux time]] is measured.  There are several sorts of cup \u2013 such as the [[Zahn cup]] and the [[Ford viscosity cup]] \u2013 with usage of each type varying mainly according to the industry. The efflux time can also be converted to kinematic viscosities (centistokes, cSt) through the conversion equations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.byk.com/fileadmin/BYK/downloads/support-downloads/instruments/theory/physical-properties/en/Intro_Viscosity.pdf|title=Viscosity|publisher=BYK-Gardner}}</ref>\n\nAlso used in coatings, a Stormer viscometer uses load-based rotation in order to determine viscosity. The viscosity is reported in Krebs units (KU), which are unique to Stormer viscometers.\n\nVibrating viscometers can also be used to measure viscosity. These models such as the ''Dynatrol'' use vibration rather than rotation to measure viscosity.\n\n''Extensional viscosity'' can be measured with various [[rheometer]]s that apply [[extensional stress]].\n\n[[Volume viscosity]] can be measured with an [[acoustic rheometer]].\n\n[[Apparent viscosity]] is a calculation derived from tests performed on [[drilling fluid]] used in oil or gas well development.

The [[poiseuille]], which is rarely used, is equivalent to the [[pascal (unit)|pascal]] [[second]] (Pa\u00b7s), or (N\u00b7s)/m<sup>2</sup>, or kg/(m\u00b7s). If a [[fluid]] is placed between two plates with distance one [[meter]], and one plate is pushed sideways with a [[shear stress]] of one [[pascal (unit)|pascal]], and it moves at {{mvar|x}} meters per [[second]], then it has viscosity of {{math|{{sfrac|1|''x''}}}} pascal seconds. For example, water at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C has a viscosity of  1.002&nbsp;mPa\u00b7s, while a typical motor oil could have a viscosity of about 250&nbsp;mPa\u00b7s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Serway |first=Raymond A. | title=Physics for Scientists & Engineers|edition=4th| publisher=Saunders College Publishing| date=1996|isbn=0-03-005932-1}}</ref>  The units used in practice are either Pa\u00b7s and its submultiples or the cgs poise referred to below, and its submultiples.\n\nThe [[cgs]] [[physical unit]] for dynamic viscosity, the ''[[poise]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/goldbook/P04705.html#search=%22poise%20iupac%22 |title=IUPAC definition of the Poise |accessdate=2010-09-14}}</ref> (P), is also named after Jean Poiseuille.

It is therefore used in [[dimensionless number]]s which compare the ratio of the diffusivities.\n\n===Fluidity===\nThe [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of viscosity is ''fluidity'', usually symbolized by {{math|1=''\u03c6'' = {{sfrac|1|''\u03bc''}}}} or {{math|1=''F'' = {{sfrac|1|''\u03bc''}}}}, depending on the convention used, measured in ''reciprocal poise'' (P<sup>\u22121</sup>, or [[centimetre|cm]]\u00b7[[second|s]]\u00b7[[gram|g]]<sup>\u22121</sup>), sometimes called the ''rhe''. ''Fluidity'' is seldom used in [[engineering]] practice.\n\nThe concept of fluidity can be used to determine the viscosity of an [[ideal solution]].

The internal friction (the viscosity) of the gas is determined by the probability a particle of layer A enters layer B with a corresponding transfer of momentum. Maxwell's calculations show that the viscosity coefficient is proportional to the density, the mean free path, and the mean velocity of the atoms. On the other hand, the ''mean free path'' is inversely proportional to the density. So an increase in density due to an increase in pressure doesn't result in any change in viscosity.\n\n====Relation to mean free path of diffusing particles====\nIn relation to diffusion, the kinematic viscosity provides a better understanding of the behavior of mass transport of a dilute species. Viscosity is related to shear stress and the rate of shear in a fluid, which illustrates its dependence on the mean free path, {{mvar|\u03bb}}, of the diffusing particles.\n\nFrom [[fluid mechanics]], for a [[Newtonian fluid]], the [[shear stress]], {{mvar|\u03c4}}, on a unit area moving parallel to itself, is found to be proportional to the rate of change of velocity with distance perpendicular to the unit area:\n\n:<math>\\tau = \\mu \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u_x}{\\mathrm{d}y}</math>\n\nfor a unit area parallel to the {{mvar|xz}}-plane, moving along the {{mvar|x}} axis. We will derive this formula and show how {{mvar|\u03bc}} is related to {{mvar|\u03bb}}.\n\nInterpreting shear stress as the time rate of change of [[momentum]], {{mvar|p}}, per unit area {{mvar|A}} (rate of momentum flux) of an arbitrary control surface gives\n\n:<math>\\tau = \\frac{\\dot{p}}{A} = \\frac{\\dot{m} \\left\\langle u_x \\right\\rangle}{A}.</math>\n\nwhere {{math|\u27e8''u<sub>x</sub>''\u27e9}} is the average velocity, along the {{mvar|x}}-axis, of fluid molecules hitting the unit area, with respect to the unit area and {{mvar|\u1e41}} is the rate of fluid mass hitting the surface.\n\nBy making simplified assumption that the velocity of the molecules depends linearly on the distance they are coming from, the mean velocity depends linearly on the mean distance:\n\n<math>\\left\\langle u_x \\right\\rangle = \\lambda\\frac{\\mathrm{d}u_x}{\\mathrm{d}y}</math>.\n\nFurther manipulation will show,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Lectures on geophysical fluid dynamics|first=R.&nbsp;L.|last=Salmon|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=1998|isbn=0-19-510808-6|page=23\u201326}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\begin{align} \\dot{m} &= \\rho \\bar{u} A \\\\ \\tau &= \\underbrace{\\rho \\bar{u} \\lambda}_{\\mu} \\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u_x}{\\mathrm{d}y} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\nu = \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho} =  \\bar{u} \\lambda, \\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere\n:{{mvar|\u03c1}} is the density of the fluid,\n:{{mvar|\u016b}} is the [[root mean square]] molecular speed: {{math|1=''\u016b'' = {{sqrt|\u27e8''u''<sup>2</sup>\u27e9}}}},\n:{{mvar|\u03bc}} is the dynamic viscosity.\nNote, that the mean free path itself typically depends (inversely) on the density.\n\n====Effect of temperature on the viscosity of a gas====\nSutherland's formula can be used to derive the dynamic viscosity of an [[ideal gas]] as a function of the temperature:<ref>{{cite book|last=Smits|first=Alexander J.|last2=Dussauge|first2=Jean-Paul|date=2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oRx6U4T8zcIC&pg=PA46|title=Turbulent shear layers in supersonic flow|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|ISBN=0-387-26140-0|page=46}}</ref>\n\n:<math> \\mu = \\mu_0 \\frac {T_0+C} {T + C} \\left (\\frac {T} {T_0} \\right )^\\frac32.</math>\n\nThis in turn is equal to\n\n:<math>\\mu = \\lambda \\frac{T^\\frac32}{T+C},</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>\\lambda = \\frac{\\mu_0\\left(T_0+C\\right)}{T_0^\\frac32}</math>\n\nis a constant for the gas.\n\nin Sutherland's formula:\n*{{mvar|\u03bc}} = dynamic viscosity (Pa\u00b7s or \u03bcPa\u00b7s) at input temperature {{mvar|T}},\n*{{math|''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub>}} = reference viscosity (in the same units as {{mvar|\u03bc}}) at reference temperature {{math|''T''<sub>0</sub>}},\n*{{mvar|T}} = input temperature (K),\n*{{math|''T''<sub>0</sub>}} = reference temperature (K),\n*{{mvar|C}} = Sutherland's constant for the gaseous material in question.\n\nValid for temperatures between {{nowrap|0 < {{mvar|T}} < 555 K}} with an error due to pressure less than 10% below 3.45&nbsp;MPa.\n\nAccording to Sutherland's formula, if the absolute temperature is less than {{mvar|C}}, the relative change in viscosity for a small change in temperature is greater than the relative change in the absolute temperature, but it is smaller when {{mvar|T}} is above {{mvar|C}}. The kinematic viscosity though always increases faster than the temperature (that is, {{math|{{sfrac|d log(''\u03bd'')|d log(''T'')}}}} is greater than 1).\n\nSutherland's constant, reference values and {{mvar|\u03bb}} values for some gases:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n|- bgcolor=\"#efefef\"\n!
