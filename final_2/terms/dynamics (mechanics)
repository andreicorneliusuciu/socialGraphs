[[Isaac Newton]] defined the fundamental [[physical laws]] which govern dynamics in physics, especially his [[second law of motion]].\n\n==Principles==\nGenerally speaking, researchers involved in dynamics study how a physical system might develop or alter over time and study the causes of those changes.  In addition,  Newton established the fundamental physical laws which govern dynamics in physics. By studying his system of mechanics, dynamics can be understood. In particular, dynamics is mostly related to Newton's second law of motion. However, all three laws of motion are taken into account because these are interrelated in any given observation or experiment.\n\n==Linear and rotational dynamics==\nThe study of dynamics falls under two categories: linear and rotational.  Linear dynamics pertains to objects moving in a line and involves such quantities as [[force]], [[mass]]/[[inertia#Mass and inertia|inertia]], [[displacement (vector)|displacement]] (in units of distance), [[velocity]] (distance per unit time), [[acceleration]] (distance per unit of time squared) and [[momentum]] (mass times unit of velocity).  Rotational dynamics pertains to objects that are rotating or moving in a curved path and involves such quantities as [[torque]], [[moment of inertia]]/[[rotational inertia]], [[angular displacement]] (in radians or less often, degrees), [[angular velocity]] (radians per unit time), [[angular acceleration]] (radians per unit of time squared) and [[angular momentum]] (moment of inertia times unit of angular velocity).  Very often, objects exhibit linear and rotational motion.\n\nFor classical [[electromagnetism]], it is [[Maxwell's equations]] that describe the dynamics. And the dynamics of classical systems involving both mechanics and electromagnetism are described by the combination of Newton's laws, Maxwell's equations, and the [[Lorentz force]].\n\n==Force==\n{{Main|Force}}\nFrom Newton, force can be defined as an exertion or [[pressure]] which can cause an object to [[accelerate]]. The concept of force is used to describe an influence which causes a [[free body]] (object) to accelerate. It can be a push or a pull, which causes an object to change direction, have new [[velocity]], or to [[deformation (mechanics)|deform]] temporarily or permanently. Generally speaking, force causes an object's [[Motion (physics)|state of motion]] to change.<ref name=Phys-tut-force>{{cite web| last =Goc| first =Roman| title =Force in Physics |date=2005 |origyear= 2004 copyright date  |url =http://www.staff.amu.edu.pl/~romangoc/M3-1-force-physics.html |format= Physics tutorial  | accessdate =2010-02-18}}</ref>\n\n==Newton's laws==\n{{Main|Newton's laws of motion}}\n\nNewton described force as the ability to cause a mass to accelerate. His three laws can be summarized as follows:\n# '''First law''': If there is no net force on an object, then its [[velocity]] is constant. The object is either at rest (if its velocity is equal to zero), or it moves with constant speed in a single direction.<ref name=first-law-shaums>{{Cite book| last = Browne| first =Michael E.| title =Schaum's outline of theory and problems of physics for engineering and science| publisher = McGraw-Hill Companies| date =July 1999| format =Series: Schaum's Outline Series| pages =58| url =https://books.google.com/?id=5gURYN4vFx4C&pg=PA58&dq=newton's+first+law+of+motion&q=newton's%20first%20law%20of%20motion| isbn =978-0-07-008498-8}}</ref><ref name=first-law-dmmy>{{Cite book| last = Holzner| first = Steven | title =Physics for Dummies| publisher =Wiley, John & Sons, Incorporated| date =December 2005| pages =64| url =https://books.google.com/?id=FrRNO6t51DMC&pg=PA64&dq=Newton's+laws+of+motion&cd=8#v=onepage&q=Newton's%20laws%20of%20motion| isbn =978-0-7645-5433-9}}</ref>\n# '''Second law''': The rate of change of linear momentum '''P''' of an object is equal to the net force '''F'''<sub>net</sub>, i.e., d'''P'''/dt = '''F'''<sub>net</sub>.<!-- Note #1: Object do not necessarily move in the direction of the net force....e.g. objects moving in a circle. Note #2: Beware! Both the acceleration and momentum formulations of Newton's second law are valid ''only'' for constant-mass systems. This is covered in the discussion below and in multiple references given. -->\n#  '''Third law''': When a first body exerts a force '''F'''<sub>1</sub> on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force '''F'''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;= &minus;'''F'''<sub>1</sub> on the first body. This means that '''F'''<sub>1</sub> and '''F'''<sub>2</sub> are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n\nNewton's Laws of Motion are valid only in an inertial frame of reference\n\n==See also==\n*[[Multibody dynamics]]\n*[[Rigid body dynamics]]\n*[[Analytical dynamics]]\n\n== References ==\n{{wikibooks|School of Engineering/Dynamics}}\n{{Wikiversity|Topic:Dynamics}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite web|author=Swagatam |year=25 March 2010 |title=Calculating Engineering Dynamics Using Newton's Laws |url=http://www.brighthub.com/engineering/mechanical/articles/111610.aspx |work=[[Bright Hub]] |accessdate=2010-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412013636/http://www.brighthub.com/engineering/mechanical/articles/111610.aspx |archivedate=April 12, 2011 }} \n*{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=C.
