This can be made much smaller than a [[discrete circuit]] made from independent [[electronic component]]s - a modern chip may have several billion [[transistor]]s in an area the size of a human fingernail.  Over the past half century, the size, speed, and capacity of chips has increased enormously, driven by technical advances that allow more and more transistors on chips of the same size.  These advances, roughly following [[Moore's law]], allow a computer chip of 2016 to have millions of times the capacity and thousands of times the speed of the computer chips of the early 1970s.  Integrated circuits are used in virtually all electronic equipment today and have revolutionized the world of [[electronics]]. [[Computer]]s, [[mobile phone]]s, and other digital [[home appliance]]s are now inextricable parts of the structure of modern societies, made possible by the low cost of ICs.\n\nICs were made possible by experimental discoveries showing that [[semiconductor device]]s could perform the functions of [[vacuum tube]]s and by mid-20th-century technology advancements in [[semiconductor device fabrication]]. The integration of large numbers of tiny [[transistor]]s into a small chip was an enormous improvement over the manual assembly of circuits using discrete [[electronic component]]s. The integrated circuit's [[mass production]] capability, reliability and building-block approach to [[Integrated circuit design|circuit design]] ensured the rapid adoption of standardized integrated circuits in place of designs using discrete transistors.\n\nICs have two main advantages over [[discrete circuit]]s: cost and performance. Cost is low because the chips, with all their components, are printed as a unit by [[photolithography]] rather than being constructed one transistor at a time. Furthermore, packaged ICs use much less material than discrete circuits. Performance is high because the IC's components switch quickly and consume little power (compared to their discrete counterparts) because of their small size and close proximity. Over the years, transistor sizes have decreased from 10s of microns in the early 1970s to around 14 nanometers in 2014<ref>{{cite web|title=Ultra-fast, energy-sipping devices powered by Intel|url=http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/silicon-innovations/intel-14nm-technology.html|publisher=Intel}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2454288/intel-shipping-broadwell-but-next-gen-skylake-chip-could-slip.html|title=Intel shipping Broadwell, but next-gen Skylake chip could slip|first=Mark |last=Hachman|work=[[PC World]] |date=July 15, 2014}}</ref> with a corresponding million-fold increase in transistors per unit area.

Jacobi disclosed small and cheap [[hearing aid]]s as typical industrial applications of his patent. An immediate commercial use of his patent has not been reported.\n\nThe idea of the integrated circuit was conceived by [[Geoffrey Dummer|Geoffrey W.A. Dummer]] (1909\u20132002), a radar scientist working for the [[Royal Radar Establishment]] of the British [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]. Dummer presented the idea to the public at the Symposium on Progress in Quality Electronic Components in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington,&nbsp;D.C.]] on 7 May 1952.<ref>[http://www.epn-online.com/page/22909/the-hapless-tale-of-geoffrey-dummer-this-is-the-sad-.html \"The Hapless Tale of Geoffrey Dummer\"], (n.d.), (HTML), ''Electronic Product News'', accessed 8 July 2008.</ref> He gave many symposia publicly to propagate his ideas, and unsuccessfully attempted to build such a circuit in 1956.\n\nA precursor idea to the IC was to create small ceramic squares (wafers), each containing a single miniaturized component. Components could then be integrated and wired into a bidimensional or tridimensional compact grid. This idea, which seemed very promising in 1957, was proposed to the US Army by [[Jack Kilby]] and led to the short-lived Micromodule Program (similar to 1951's [[Project Tinkertoy]]).<ref>George Rostky, (n. d.), [http://www.eetimes.com/special/special_issues/millennium/milestones/kilby.html \"Micromodules: the ultimate package\"], (HTML), ''EE Times'', accessed 8 July 2008.</ref> However, as the project was gaining momentum, Kilby came up with a new, revolutionary design: the&nbsp;IC.\n\n[[File:Kilby solid circuit.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jack Kilby]]'s original integrated circuit]]\n\nNewly employed by [[Texas Instruments]], Kilby recorded his initial ideas concerning the integrated circuit in July 1958, successfully demonstrating the first working integrated example on 12 September 1958.<ref name=\"TIJackBuilt\">[http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/kilbyctr/jackbuilt.shtml ''The Chip that Jack Built''], (c. 2008), (HTML), Texas Instruments, Retrieved 29 May 2008.</ref> In his patent application of 6 February 1959,<ref>Jack S.

Noyce's design was made of [[silicon]], whereas Kilby's chip was made of [[germanium]]. Noyce credited [[Kurt Lehovec]] of [[Robert C. Sprague (inventor)|Sprague Electric]] for the principle of [[p\u2013n junction isolation|p\u2013n&nbsp;junction isolation]], a key concept behind the&nbsp;IC.<ref>Kurt Lehovec's patent on the isolation p\u2013n&nbsp;junction: {{US patent|3029366}} granted on 10 April 1962, filed 22 April 1959.

The technology was developed by Italian physicist [[Federico Faggin]] in 1968, who later joined Intel in order to develop the very first single-chip Central Processing Unit (CPU) ([[Intel 4004]]), for which he received the [[National Medal of Technology and Innovation]] in 2010.\n\n== Advances in integrated circuits ==\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2012}}\nAdvances in IC technology, primarily smaller features and larger chips, have allowed the number of transistors in an integrated circuit to double every two years, a trend known as [[Moore's law]]. This increased capacity has been used to decrease cost and increase functionality.  In general, as the feature size shrinks, almost every aspect of an IC's operation improves.  The cost per transistor and the [[low-power electronics|switching power consumption]] per transistor go down, while the memory capacity and [[clock rate|speed]] go up, through the relationships defined by [[Dennard scaling]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Davari, Bijan, Robert H.

This process, and the expected progress over the next few years, was described for many years by the [[International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors]] (ITRS).  The final ITRS was issued in 2016, and it is being replaced by the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems.<ref>{{cite web |title=International Roadmap for Devices and Systems |publisher=IEEE |year=2016 |url=http://rebootingcomputing.ieee.org/images/files/pdf/rc_irds.pdf}}</ref>\n\nInitially, ICs were strictly electronic devices.  The success of ICs has led to the integration of other technologies, in the attempt to obtain the same advantages of small size and low cost. These technologies include mechanical devices, optics, and sensors.\n*Very small mechanical devices driven by electricity can be integrated onto chips, using a technology known as [[microelectromechanical systems]]. These devices were developed in the late 1980s<ref>{{cite conference |title=A decade of MEMS and its future |author=H.

The main process steps are supplemented by doping and cleaning.\n\n[[Monocrystalline silicon|Mono-crystal silicon]] [[wafer (electronics)|wafers]] (or for special applications, [[silicon on sapphire]] or gallium arsenide wafers) are used as the ''substrate''. [[Photolithography]] is used to mark different areas of the substrate to be [[Doping (Semiconductors)|doped]] or to have polysilicon, insulators or metal (typically aluminium or copper) tracks deposited on them.\n* Integrated circuits are composed of many overlapping layers, each defined by photolithography, and normally shown in different colors. Some layers mark where various dopants are diffused into the substrate (called diffusion layers), some define where additional ions are implanted (implant layers), some define the conductors (polysilicon or metal layers), and some define the connections between the conducting layers (via or contact layers). All components are constructed from a specific combination of these layers.\n* In a self-aligned [[CMOS]] process, a [[transistor]] is formed wherever the gate layer (polysilicon or metal) crosses a diffusion layer.\n* [[capacitor|Capacitive structures]], in form very much like the parallel conducting plates of a traditional electrical capacitor, are formed according to the area of the \"plates\", with insulating material between the plates. Capacitors of a wide range of sizes are common on ICs.\n* Meandering stripes of varying lengths are sometimes used to form on-chip [[resistor]]s, though most logic circuits do not need any resistors. The ratio of the length of the resistive structure to its width, combined with its sheet resistivity, determines the resistance.\n* More rarely, [[inductor|inductive structures]] can be built as tiny on-chip coils, or simulated by [[gyrator]]s.\n\nSince a CMOS device only draws current on the ''transition'' between [[boolean algebra (logic)|logic]] [[State (computer science)|states]], CMOS devices consume much less current than [[bipolar transistor|bipolar]] devices.\n\nA [[random-access memory]] is the most regular type of integrated circuit; the highest density devices are thus memories; but even a [[microprocessor]] will have memory on the chip. (See the regular array structure at the bottom of the first image.) Although the structures are intricate \u2013 with widths which have been shrinking for decades \u2013 the layers remain much thinner than the device widths. The layers of material are fabricated much like a photographic process, although light [[wave]]s in the [[visible spectrum]] cannot be used to \"expose\" a layer of material, as they would be too large for the features. Thus [[photon]]s of higher frequencies (typically [[ultraviolet]]) are used to create the patterns for each layer. Because each feature is so small, [[electron microscope]]s are essential tools for a [[industrial process|process]] engineer who might be [[debugging]] a fabrication process.\n\nEach device is tested before packaging using automated test equipment (ATE), in a process known as [[wafer testing]], or wafer probing. The wafer is then cut into rectangular blocks, each of which is called a ''die''. Each good [[die (integrated circuit)|die]] (plural ''dice'', ''dies'', or ''die'') is then connected into a package using aluminium (or gold) [[bond wire]]s which are [[Thermosonic bonding|thermosonically bonded]]<ref>Coucoulas, A., http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hot_Work_Ultrasonic_(Thermosonic)_Bonding_549-556.pdf [https://sites.google.com/site/hotworkultrasonicbonding/ \"Hot Work Ultrasonic Bonding \u2013 A Method Of Facilitating Metal Flow By Restoration Processes\"], Proc. 20th IEEE Electronic Components Conf.

[[Thermosonic bonding]] was first introduced by A. Coucoulas which provided a reliable means of forming these vital electrical  connections to the outside world. After packaging, the devices go through final testing on the same or similar ATE used during wafer probing. [[Industrial CT scanning]] can also be used. Test cost can account for over 25% of the cost of fabrication on lower-cost products, but can be negligible on low-yielding, larger, or higher-cost devices.\n\nAs of 2016, a [[Semiconductor fabrication plant|fabrication facility]] (commonly known as a ''semiconductor fab'') can cost over US$8 billion to construct.<ref>{{cite web |title=How Intel Makes a Chip |date=June 9, 2016 |author=Max Chafkin and Ian King |publisher=Bloomburg Businessweek |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-09/how-intel-makes-a-chip}}</ref> The cost of a fabrication facility rises over time ([[Rock's law]]) because much of the operation is automated.

The next step, to 10 nm devices, is expected in 2017.<ref>{{cite web |title=10 nm Fab Watch |author=Mark Lapedus |publisher=Semiconductor Engineering |url=http://semiengineering.com/10nm-fab-watch/ |date=May 21, 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Copper interconnect]]s where copper wiring replaces aluminium for interconnects.\n* [[Low-K]] dielectric insulators.\n* [[Silicon on insulator]] (SOI).\n* [[Strained silicon]] in a process used by [[IBM]] known as [[strained silicon directly on insulator]] (SSDOI).\n* [[Multigate device]]s such as tri-gate transistors being manufactured by [[Intel]] from 2011 in their 22&nbsp;nm process.\n\n=== Packaging ===\n{{Main article|Integrated circuit packaging}}\n[[File:RUS-IC.JPG|right|thumb|A Soviet MSI nMOS chip made in 1977, part of a four-chip calculator set designed in 1970<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.155la3.ru/k145_3.htm#k145hk1 | title = 145 series ICs (in Russian) | accessdate=22 April 2012 }}</ref>]]\n\nThe earliest integrated circuits were packaged in ceramic [[Flatpack (electronics)|flat packs]], which continued to be used by the military for their reliability and small size for many years. Commercial circuit packaging quickly moved to the [[dual in-line package]] (DIP), first in ceramic and later in plastic. In the 1980s pin counts of VLSI circuits exceeded the practical limit for DIP packaging, leading to [[pin grid array]] (PGA) and [[leadless chip carrier]] (LCC) packages. [[Surface mount]] packaging appeared in the early 1980s and became popular in the late 1980s, using finer lead pitch with leads formed as either gull-wing or J-lead, as exemplified by the [[small-outline integrated circuit]] (SOIC) package \u2013 a carrier which occupies an area about 30\u201350% less than an equivalent DIP and is typically 70% thinner. This package has \"gull wing\" leads protruding from the two long sides and a lead spacing of 0.050&nbsp;inches.\n\nIn the late 1990s, [[PQFP|plastic quad flat pack]] (PQFP) and [[thin small-outline package]] (TSOP) packages became the most common for high pin count devices, though PGA packages are still often used for high-end [[microprocessor]]s. Intel and AMD are currently transitioning from PGA packages on high-end microprocessors to [[land grid array]] (LGA) packages.\n\n[[Ball grid array]] (BGA) packages have existed since the 1970s. [[Flip chip|Flip-chip Ball Grid Array]] packages, which allow for much higher pin count than other package types, were developed in the 1990s. In an FCBGA package the die is mounted upside-down (flipped) and connects to the package balls via a package substrate that is similar to a printed-circuit board rather than by wires. FCBGA packages allow an array of input-output signals (called Area-I/O) to be distributed over the entire die rather than being confined to the die periphery.\n\nTraces going out of the die, through the package, and into the [[printed circuit board]] have very different electrical properties, compared to on-chip signals. They require special design techniques and need much more electric power than signals confined to the chip itself.\n\nWhen multiple dies are put in one package, the result is a [[System in Package]], or SiP. A [[Multi-Chip Module]], or MCM, is created by combining multiple dies on a small substrate often made of ceramic. The distinction between a big MCM and a small printed circuit board is sometimes fuzzy.\n\n=== Chip labeling and manufacture date ===\nMost integrated circuits are large enough to include identifying information. Four common sections are the manufacturer's name or logo, the part number, a part production batch number and serial number, and a four-digit date-code to identify when the chip was manufactured. Extremely small [[surface mount technology]] parts often bear only a number used in a manufacturer's lookup table to find the chip characteristics.\n\nThe manufacturing date is commonly represented as a two-digit year followed by a two-digit week code, such that a part bearing the code 8341 was manufactured in week 41 of 1983, or approximately in October 1983.\n\n== Intellectual property ==\n{{Main article|Integrated circuit layout design protection}}\n\nThe possibility of copying by photographing each layer of an integrated circuit and preparing [[photomasks]] for its production on the basis of the photographs obtained is a reason for the introduction of legislation for the protection of layout-designs. The [[Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984]] established intellectual property protection for photomasks used to produce integrated circuits.<ref name=\"USC-circ100\">{{cite web|title=Federal Statutory Protection for Mask Works|url=https://copyright.gov/circs/circ100.pdf|website=United States Copyright Office|publisher=United States Copyright Office|accessdate=22 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nA diplomatic conference was held at Washington, D.C., in 1989, which adopted a [[Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of Integrated Circuits]] (IPIC Treaty).\n\nThe Treaty on Intellectual Property in respect of Integrated Circuits, also called Washington Treaty or IPIC Treaty (signed at Washington on 26 May 1989) is currently not in force, but was partially integrated into the [[TRIPS]] agreement.<ref>On Jan. 1, 1995, the ''Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights'' (TRIPs) (Annex 1C to the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement), went into force.

Korea passed the ''Act Concerning the Layout-Design of Semiconductor Integrated Circuits''</ref>\n\n== Other developments ==\n\nFuture developments seem to follow the [[multi-core]] multi-microprocessor paradigm, already used by Intel and AMD multi-core processors. Rapport Inc. and IBM started shipping the [[Kilocore|KC256]] in 2006, a 256-core microprocessor. Intel, as recently as February\u2013August 2011, unveiled a prototype, \"not for commercial sale\" chip that bears 80 cores. Each core is capable of handling its own task independently of the others. This is in response to the [[heat-versus-speed limit]] that is about to be reached using [[CMOS|existing transistor technology]] (see: [[thermal design power]]). This design provides a new challenge to chip programming. [[Parallel programming language]]s such as the open-source [[X10 (programming language)|X10]] programming language are designed to assist with this task.<ref>Biever, C. \"Chip revolution poses problems for programmers\", New Scientist (Vol 193, Number 2594)</ref>\n== Generations of ICs==\nIn the early days of simple integrated circuits, the technology's large scale limited each chip to only a few transistors, and the low degree of integration meant the design process was relatively simple.

Early digital circuits containing tens of transistors provided a few logic gates, and early linear ICs such as the [[Plessey]] SL201 or the [[Philips]] TAA320 had as few as two transistors. The number of transistors in an integrated circuit has increased dramatically since then. The term \"large scale integration\" (LSI) was first used by [[IBM]] scientist [[Rolf Landauer]] when describing the theoretical concept;{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} that term gave rise to the terms \"small-scale integration\" (SSI), \"medium-scale integration\" (MSI), \"very-large-scale integration\" (VLSI), and \"ultra-large-scale integration\" (ULSI). The early integrated circuits were SSI.\n\nSSI circuits were crucial to early [[aerospace]] projects, and aerospace projects helped inspire development of the technology. Both the [[Minuteman missile]] and [[Apollo program]] needed lightweight digital computers for their inertial guidance systems. Although the [[Apollo guidance computer]] led and motivated integrated-circuit technology,<ref>{{cite book |last=Mindell |first=David A. |title=Digital Apollo: Human and Machine in Spaceflight |year=2008 |publisher=The MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-13497-2}}</ref> it was the Minuteman missile that forced it into mass-production. The Minuteman missile program and various other Navy programs accounted for the total $4 million integrated circuit market in 1962, and by 1968, U.S. Government space and defense spending still accounted for 37% of the $312 million total production. The demand by the U.S. Government supported the nascent integrated circuit market until costs fell enough to allow firms to penetrate the industrial, and eventually, the consumer markets. The average price per integrated circuit dropped from $50.00 in 1962 to $2.33 in 1968.<ref>{{cite book| last = Ginzberg| first = Eli| title = Economic impact of large public programs: the NASA Experience| year = 1976| publisher = Olympus Publishing Company| isbn = 0-913420-68-9| page = 57 }}</ref> Integrated circuits began to appear in consumer products by the turn of the decade, a typical application being [[Frequency modulation|FM]] inter-carrier sound processing in television receivers.\n\nThe first MOS chips were small-scale integration chips for [[NASA]] satellites.<ref name=\"forging\" />\n\nThe next step in the development of integrated circuits, taken in the late 1960s, introduced devices which contained hundreds of transistors on each chip, called \"medium-scale integration\" (MSI).\n\nIn 1964, [[Frank Wanlass]] demonstrated a single-chip 16-bit shift register he designed, with an incredible (at the time) 120 transistors on a single chip.<ref name=\"forging\">\n{{cite book\n | title = We were burning: Japanese entrepreneurs and the forging of the electronic age\n | author = Bob Johnstone\n | publisher = Basic Books\n | year = 1999\n | isbn = 978-0-465-09118-8\n | pages = 47\u201348\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PE1bQS9VpWoC&pg=PA47\n }}</ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.eecs.umich.edu/eecs/about/articles/2007/Boysel.html\n| title = Making Your First Million (and other tips for aspiring entrepreneurs)\n| author = Lee Boysel\n| date = 2007-10-12\n| work = U.

However, modern VLSI devices contain so many transistors, layers, interconnections, and other features that it is no longer feasible to check the masks or do the original design by hand. The engineer depends on computer programs and other hardware aids to do most of this work.<ref>\nC. F.

True LSI circuits, approaching 10,000 transistors, began to be produced around 1974, for computer main memories and second-generation microprocessors.\n\nSome SSI and MSI chips, like [[discrete transistor]]s,  are still mass-produced, both to maintain old equipment and build new devices that require only a few gates.

The development started with hundreds of thousands of transistors in the early 1980s, and continues beyond ten billion transistors as of 2016.\n\nMultiple developments were required to achieve this increased density. Manufacturers moved to smaller design rules and cleaner fabrication facilities, so that they could make chips with more transistors and maintain adequate yield. The path of process improvements was summarized by the [[International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors]] (ITRS). [[Electronic design automation|Design tools]] improved enough to make it practical to finish these designs in a reasonable time. The more energy-efficient [[CMOS]] replaced [[NMOS logic|NMOS]] and [[PMOS logic|PMOS]], avoiding a prohibitive increase in power consumption.\n\nIn 1986 the first one-megabit [[Random-access memory|RAM]] chips were introduced, containing more than one million transistors.
