The effectiveness of a seal is dependent on adhesion in the case of [[sealant]]s and compression in the case of [[gasket]]s.\n\nA stationary seal may also be referred to as 'packing'.\n\nSeal types:\n*[[Induction sealing]] or cap sealing\n*[[Sealant|Adhesive, sealant]]\n*[[Bodok seal]], a specialized gas sealing washer for medical applications\n*[[Bonded seal]], also  known as [[Dowty Group|Dowty]] seal or Dowty washer.
