X terminals enjoyed a period of popularity in the early 1990s when they offered a lower [[total cost of ownership]] alternative to a full [[Unix]] [[workstation]].\n\nAn X terminal runs an [[X server]]. (In X, the usage of \"client\" and \"server\" is from the viewpoint of the programs: the X server supplies a screen, keyboard, mouse and touchscreen to client applications.) This connects to an [[X display manager (program type)|X display manager]] (introduced in X11R3) running on a central machine, using [[XDMCP]] (X Display Manager Control Protocol, introduced in X11R4).<ref>{{Citation | first1 = Linda | last1 = Mui | first2 = Eric | last2 = Pearce | title = X Window System | volume = 8: X Window System Administrator's Guide for X11 Release 4 and Release 5 | edition = 3rd | publisher = O'Reilly & Associates | date = July 1993 | format = softcover | ISBN = 0-937175-83-8}}.</ref>{{Page needed |date=October 2015}}\n\n[[Thin client]]s have somewhat supplanted X terminals in that they are equipped with added [[flash memory]] and software for communication with [[remote desktop software|remote desktop]] protocols. \n\n==Vendors==\nIn the early 1990s, several vendors introduced X terminals including [[Network Computing Devices]] (NCD), Gipsi, [[HP X-Terminals|Hewlett Packard]] (HP), [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC, later absorbed by HP), [[IBM]], [[Samsung]]<ref>{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nzsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT39 | title = InfoWorld | date = 28 May 1990}}.</ref> and [[Tektronix]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Corcoran |first=Cate |year=1992 |title= Study shows 115 percent increase in X terminal sales for 1991 |journal=InfoWorld |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=26 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9T0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA26&dq=x-terminal&cd=3#v=onepage&q=&f=false |quote= Network Computing Devices dominated the market...
