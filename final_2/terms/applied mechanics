Applied mechanics describes the ''response of bodies (solids and fluids) or systems of bodies to external [[force]]s''. Some examples of ''mechanical systems'' include the flow of a [[liquid]] under [[pressure]], the fracture of a [[solid]] from an applied force, or the vibration of an ear in response to [[sound]]. A practitioner of the discipline is known as a '''[[mechanician]]'''. \n\nEngineering mechanics describes the behavior of a body, in either a beginning state of rest or of motion, subjected to the action of forces.<ref>''Engineering Mechanics (statics and dynamics)'' - Dr.N.Kottiswaran ISBN 978-81-908993-3-8 \n</ref> Applied mechanics, bridges the gap between physical theory and its application to [[technology]].  It is used in many fields of [[engineering]], especially [[mechanical engineering]]. In this context, it is commonly referred to as '''engineering mechanics'''. Much of modern engineering mechanics is based on [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]] while the modern \npractice of their application can be traced back to [[Stephen Timoshenko]], who is said to be the father of modern engineering mechanics.\n\nWithin the theoretical sciences, applied mechanics is useful in formulating new ideas and theories, discovering and interpreting phenomena, and developing experimental and computational tools. In the application of the [[natural science]]s, mechanics was said to be complemented by [[thermodynamics]], the study of heat and more generally [[energy]], and [[electromechanics]], the study of [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]].<ref>''Thermodynamics - and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances''. Lewis, G. and M. Randall (1923)</ref>\n\n==Applied mechanics in practice==\nThe advances and research in Applied Mechanics has wide application in many fields of study. Some of the specialties that put the subject into practice are [[Mechanical Engineering]], [[Construction Engineering]], [[Materials Science and Engineering]], [[Aerospace Engineering]], [[Chemical Engineering]], [[Electrical Engineering]], [[Nuclear Engineering]], [[Structural engineering]] and [[Bioengineering]] Prof. S. Marichamy said that \"Mechanics is the study of bodies which are in motion or rest condition under the action of Forces\"\n\n==Major topics of applied mechanics==\n{{colbegin|2}}\n* [[Acoustics]]\n* [[Analytical mechanics]]\n* [[Computational mechanics]]\n* [[Contact mechanics]]\n* [[Continuum mechanics]]\n* [[Dynamics (mechanics)]]\n* [[Elasticity (physics)]]\n* [[Experimental mechanics]]\n* [[Fatigue (material)]]\n* [[Finite element method]]\n* [[Fluid mechanics]]\n* [[Fracture mechanics]]\n* [[Laws of Mechanics]]\n* [[Mechanics of materials]]\n* [[Mechanics of structures]]\n* [[Rock mechanics]]\n* [[Rotordynamics]]\n* [[Solid mechanics]]\n* [[Soil mechanics]]\n* [[Stress wave]]s\n* [[Viscoelasticity]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Examples of applications==\n*[[Civil engineering]]\n*[[Mechanical Engineering]]\n*[[Nuclear engineering]]\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin|2}}\n* [[Biomechanics]]\n* [[Geomechanics]]\n* [[Mechanicians]]\n* [[Mechanics]]\n* [[Physics]]\n* [[Principle of moments]]\n* [[Structural analysis]]\n* [[Kinetics (physics)]]\n* [[Kinematics]]\n* [[Dynamics (physics)]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Jacob Pieter Den Hartog|J.P.
