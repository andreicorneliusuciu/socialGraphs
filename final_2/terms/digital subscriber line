In telecommunications marketing, the term DSL is widely understood to mean [[asymmetric digital subscriber line]] (ADSL), the most commonly installed DSL technology, for [[Internet access]]. DSL service can be delivered simultaneously with [[Plain old telephone service|wired telephone service]] on the same telephone line. This is possible because DSL uses higher [[frequency band]]s for data. On the customer premises, a [[DSL filter]] on each non-DSL outlet blocks any high-frequency interference to enable simultaneous use of the voice and DSL services.\n\nThe [[bit rate]] of consumer DSL services typically ranges from 256&nbsp;kbit/s to over 100&nbsp;Mbit/s in the direction to the customer ([[downstream (networking)|downstream]]), depending on DSL technology, line conditions, and service-level implementation. Bit rates of 1&nbsp;Gbit/s have been reached in trials,<ref>[http://gizmodo.com/the-next-generation-of-dsl-can-pump-1gbps-through-coppe-1484256467 The Next Generation of DSL Can Pump 1Gbps Through Copper Phone Lines], Gizmodo, 18 December 2013, Andrew Tarantola</ref> but most homes are likely to be limited to 500-800 Mbit/s.  In ADSL, the data throughput in the [[upstream (networking)|upstream]] direction (the direction to the service provider) is lower, hence the designation of ''asymmetric'' service. In [[symmetric digital subscriber line]] (SDSL) services, the downstream and upstream data rates are equal. Researchers at [[Bell Labs]] have reached speeds of 10 [[Gbit/s]], while delivering 1 Gbit/s symmetrical broadband access services using traditional copper telephone lines. These higher speeds are lab results, however.<ref>[http://phys.org/news/2014-07-alcatel-lucent-broadband-copper.html Alcatel-Lucent sets broadband speed record using copper], Phys.org, 10 July 2014, Nancy Owano</ref><ref>[http://www.engadget.com/2014/07/10/alcatel-lucent-broadband-copper-world-record/ Researchers get record broadband speeds out of old-school copper wire], Engadget, 10 July 2014, Matt Brian</ref> A 2012 survey found that \"DSL continues to be the dominant technology for broadband access\" with 364.1 million subscribers worldwide.\n\n==History==\nFor a long time it was thought that it was not possible to operate a conventional phone-line beyond low-speed limits (typically under 9600 bit/s). In the 1950s, ordinary twisted-pair telephone-cable often carried four megahertz (MHz) television signals between studios, suggesting that such lines would allow transmitting many megabits per second. One such circuit in the [[UK]] ran some ten miles (16&nbsp;km) between the [[BBC]] studios in [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]] and the [[Pontop Pike transmitting station]]. It was able to give the studios a low quality cue feed but not one suitable for transmission.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} However, these cables had other impairments besides [[Gaussian noise]], preventing such rates from becoming practical in the field.\n\nThe 1980s saw the development of techniques for [[broadband]] communications that allowed the limit to be greatly extended. A patent was filed in 1979 for the use of existing telephone wires for both telephones and data terminals that were connected to a remote computer via a digital data carrier system.<ref>{{cite web |title= Audio and full duplex digital data carrier system |author1=John E.

ADSL supports two modes of transport\u2014fast channel and [[Bit-interleaving|interleaved channel]]. Fast channel is preferred for [[streaming multimedia]], where an occasional ''dropped [[bit]]'' is acceptable, but lags are less so. Interleaved channel works better for file transfers, where the delivered data must be error-free but latency (time delay) incurred by the retransmission of error-containing packets is acceptable.\n\nConsumer-oriented ADSL was designed to operate on existing lines already conditioned for [[Basic Rate Interface]] ISDN services, which itself is a digital [[circuit switching]] service (non-IP), though most [[incumbent local exchange carrier]]s (ILECs) provision [[Rate-Adaptive Digital Subscriber Line]] (RADSL) to work on virtually any available copper pair facility, whether conditioned for BRI or not.\nEngineers developed high speed DSL facilities such as [[High bit rate Digital Subscriber Line]] (HDSL) and [[Symmetric Digital Subscriber Line]] (SDSL) to provision traditional [[Digital Signal 1]] (DS1) services over standard copper pair facilities.\n\nOlder ADSL standards delivered 8 [[Mbit/s]] to the customer over about {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} of [[unshielded twisted pair|unshielded twisted-pair]] copper wire. Newer variants improved these rates. Distances greater than {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} significantly reduce the [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] usable on the wires, thus reducing the data rate. But [[ADSL loop extender]]s increase these distances by repeating the signal, allowing the LEC to deliver DSL speeds to any distance.<ref>[http://www.strowger.com Infinite Reach ADSL]</ref>\n\n[[File:Lantiq XWAY VRX288 V1.1.png|thumb|DSL [[System on a chip|SoC]]]]\nUntil the late 1990s, the cost of [[digital signal processor]]s for DSL was prohibitive. All types of DSL employ highly complex [[digital signal processing]] algorithms to overcome the inherent limitations of the existing [[twisted pair]] wires. Due to the advancements of [[very-large-scale integration]] (VLSI) technology, the cost of the equipment associated with a DSL deployment lowered significantly. The two main pieces of equipment are a [[digital subscriber line access multiplexer]] (DSLAM) at one end and a [[DSL modem]] at the other end.\n\nA DSL connection can be deployed over existing cable. Such deployment, even including equipment, is much cheaper than installing a new, high-bandwidth [[fiber-optic]] cable over the same route and distance. This is true both for ADSL and SDSL variations. The commercial success of DSL and similar technologies largely reflects the advances made in [[electronics]] over the decades that have increased performance and reduced costs even while digging trenches in the ground for new cables (copper or fiber optic) remains expensive.\n\nIn the case of ADSL, competition in Internet access caused subscription fees to drop significantly over the years, thus making ADSL more economical than dial up access. Telephone companies were pressured into moving to ADSL largely due to competition from cable companies, which use [[DOCSIS cable modem]] technology to achieve similar speeds. Demand for high bandwidth applications, such as video and file sharing, also contributed to popularize ADSL technology.\n\nEarly DSL service required a dedicated [[dry loop]], but when the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) required ILECs to lease their lines to competing DSL service providers, shared-line DSL became available. Also known as DSL over [[Unbundled Network Element]], this unbundling of services allows a single subscriber to receive two separate services from two separate providers on one cable pair. The DSL service provider's equipment is co-located in the same central office (telephone exchange) as that of the ILEC supplying the customer's pre-existing voice service. The subscriber's circuit is rewired to interface with hardware supplied by the ILEC which combines a DSL frequency and POTS signals on a single copper pair facility.\n\nBy 2012 some carriers in the United States reported that DSL remote terminals with fiber [[backhaul (telecommunications)|backhaul]] are replacing older ADSL systems.<ref>[http://gigaom.com/2012/04/24/the-dsl-death-march-continues/ DSL Death March Continues] by Om Malik, Apr 24, 2012, Gigaom.com</ref>\n\n==Operation==\nTelephones are connected to the [[telephone exchange]] via a [[local loop]], which is a physical pair of wires. The local loop was originally intended mostly for the transmission of speech, encompassing an audio frequency range of 300 to 3400 [[hertz]] ([[voiceband]] or [[commercial bandwidth]]). However, as long-distance [[Trunking|trunk]]s were gradually converted from analog to digital operation, the idea of being able to pass data through the local loop (by utilizing frequencies above the voiceband) took hold, ultimately leading to DSL.\n\nThe [[local loop]] connecting the telephone exchange to most subscribers has the capability of carrying frequencies well beyond the 3.4&nbsp;kHz upper limit of [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]]. Depending on the length and quality of the loop, the upper limit can be tens of megahertz. DSL takes advantage of this unused [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of the local loop by creating 4312.5&nbsp;Hz wide channels starting between 10 and 100&nbsp;kHz, depending on how the system is configured. Allocation of channels continues at higher and higher frequencies (up to 1.1&nbsp;MHz for ADSL) until new channels are deemed unusable. Each channel is evaluated for usability in much the same way an [[analog signal|analog]] modem would on a POTS connection. More usable channels equates to more available bandwidth, which is why distance and line quality are a factor (the higher frequencies used by DSL travel only short distances). The pool of usable channels is then split into two different frequency bands for [[upstream (networking)|upstream]] and [[downstream (networking)|downstream]] traffic, based on a preconfigured ratio. This segregation reduces interference. Once the channel groups have been established, the individual [[channel (communications)|channel]]s are [[Channel bonding|bonded]] into a pair of virtual circuits, one in each direction. Like analog modems, DSL [[transceiver]]s constantly monitor the quality of each channel and will add or remove them from service depending on whether they are usable. Once upstream and downstream circuits are established, a [[subscriber]] can connect to a service such as an [[Internet service provider]] or other network services, like a corporate MPLS network.\n\nThe underlying technology of transport across DSL facilities uses high-frequency [[sinusoidal]] [[carrier wave]] modulation, which is an analog signal transmission. A DSL circuit terminates at each end in a [[modem]] which modulates patterns of [[Binary digit|bits]] into certain high-frequency impulses for transmission to the opposing modem. Signals received from the far-end modem are demodulated to yield a corresponding bit pattern that the modem retransmits, in digital form, to its interfaced equipment, such as a computer, router, switch, etc.\n\nUnlike traditional dial-up modems, which modulate bits into signals in the 300\u20133400&nbsp;Hz baseband (voice service), DSL modems modulate frequencies from 4000&nbsp;Hz to as high as 4&nbsp;MHz. This frequency band separation enables DSL service and [[plain old telephone service]] (POTS) to coexist on the same copper pair facility. On the subscriber's end of the circuit, inline [[low-pass]] [[DSL filter]]s (splitters) are installed on each telephone to filter the high-frequency signals that would otherwise be heard as hiss, but pass voice frequencies. Conversely, [[high-pass filter]]s already incorporated in the circuitry of DSL modems filter out voice frequencies. Although ADSL and RADSL modulations do not use the voice-frequency band, nonlinear elements in the phone could otherwise generate audible intermodulation and may impair the operation of the data modem in the absence of high-pass filters.\n[[File:T-DSL Modem.jpg|thumb|right|A DSL modem]]\n\nBecause DSL operates above the 3.4&nbsp;kHz voice limit, it cannot pass through a [[Loading coil|load coil]], which is an inductive coil that is designed to counteract loss caused by shunt capacitance (capacitance between the two wires of the twisted pair). Load coils are commonly set at regular intervals in lines placed only for POTS. A DSL signal cannot pass through a properly installed and working load coil, while voice service cannot be maintained past a certain distance without such coils. Therefore, some areas that are within range for DSL service are disqualified from eligibility because of load coil placement. Because of this, phone companies endeavor to remove load coils on copper loops that can operate without them, and by conditioning other lines to avoid them through the use of fiber to the neighborhood or node ([[FTTN]]).\n\nMost residential and small-office DSL implementations reserve low frequencies for POTS, so that (with suitable filters and/or splitters) the existing voice service continues to operate independent of the DSL service. Thus POTS-based communications, including [[Fax|fax machines]] and analog modems, can share the wires with DSL. Only one DSL modem can use the [[subscriber line]] at a time. The standard way to let multiple computers share a DSL connection uses a [[Router (computing)|router]] that establishes a connection between the DSL modem and a local [[Ethernet]], [[Power line communication|Powerline]], or [[Wi-Fi]] network on the customer's premises.\n\nThe theoretical foundations of DSL, like much of [[communication]] technology, can be traced back to [[Claude Shannon]]'s seminal 1948 paper: ''[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]''. Generally, higher bit rate transmissions require a wider frequency band, though the ratio of [[bit rate]] to [[symbol rate]] and thus to bandwidth are not linear due to significant innovations in [[digital signal processing]] and [[Digital modulation#Digital modulation methods|digital modulation methods]].\n\n===Naked DSL===\n{{Globalize/US|section|date=November 2010}}\nA [[naked DSL]] (also known as standalone or [[dry loop]] DSL) is a way of providing DSL services without a [[PSTN]] ([[analog signal|analogue]] [[telephony]]) service. It is useful when the customer does not need the traditional [[telephony]] voice service because voice service is received either on top of the DSL services (usually [[Voice over IP|VoIP]]) or through another network ([[mobile telephony]]).\n\nIt is also commonly called a \"UNE\" (for [[Unbundled Network Element]]) in the United States; in Australia it is known as a \"ULL\" (Unconditioned Local Loop);<ref>[http://whirlpool.net.au/wiki/ull ULL (Unconditioned Local Loop)].

The telephone company connects the other end of the line to a [[DSLAM]], which concentrates a large number of individual DSL connections into a single box. The location of the DSLAM depends on the telco, but it cannot be located too far from the user because of [[attenuation]] between the DSLAM and the user's DSL modem. It is common for a few residential blocks to be connected to one DSLAM.\n\nThe accompanying figure is a schematic of a simple DSL connection (in blue). The right side shows a DSLAM residing in the telephone company's central office. The left side shows the customer premises equipment with an optional router.  This router manages a local area network (LAN) off of which are connected some number of PCs. With many service providers, the customer may opt for a modem which contains a wireless router. This option (within the dashed bubble) often simplifies the connection.\n[[File:Dsl schematic.svg|thumb|center|600px|DSL Connection schematic]]\n\n[[File:Outdoor DSLAM.JPG|thumb|Example of a DSLAM from 2006]]\n\n===Exchange equipment===\nAt the exchange, a [[digital subscriber line access multiplexer]] (DSLAM) [[Electrical termination|terminate]]s the DSL circuits and aggregates them, where they are [[handoff|handed off]] to other networking transports. In the case of ADSL, the voice component is also separated at this step, either by a filter integrated in the DSLAM or by a specialized filtering equipment installed before it. The DSLAM terminates all connections and recovers the original digital information.\n\n===Customer equipment===\nThe customer end of the connection consists of a terminal adaptor or \"[[DSL modem]]\". This converts data between the digital signals used by computers and the [[voltage]] signal of a suitable frequency range which is then applied to the phone line.\n[[File:Dsl modem schematic.svg|thumb|center|400px|DSL Modem schematic]]\n\nIn some DSL variations (for example, [[HDSL]]), the terminal adapter connects directly to the computer via a serial interface, using protocols such as [[ethernet]] or [[V.35 (recommendation)|V.35]]. In other cases (particularly ADSL), it is common for the customer equipment to be integrated with higher level functionality, such as routing, firewalling, or other application-specific hardware and software. In this case, the equipment is referred to as a \"gateway\".\n\nMost DSL technologies require installation of appropriate filters to separate, or \"split\", the DSL signal from the low-frequency voice signal. The separation can take place either at the [[demarcation point]], or with filters installed at the telephone outlets inside the customer premises. Each way has its practical and economic limitations.\n\nWhen the DSL modem powers up it goes through a series of steps to establish connections. The actual process varies from modem to modem but generally involves the following steps:\n# The DSL transceiver performs a self-test.\n# The DSL transceiver then attempts to [[synchronize]] with the DSLAM. Data can only come into the computer when the DSLAM and the modem are synchronized. The synchronization process is relatively quick (in the range of seconds) but is very complex, involving extensive tests that allow both sides of the connection to optimize the performance according to the characteristics of the line in use. External, or standalone modem units have an indicator labeled \"CD\", \"DSL\", or \"LINK\", which can be used to tell if the modem is synchronized. During synchronization the light flashes; when synchronized, the light stays lit, usually with a green color.\n# The DSL transceiver checks the connection between the DSL transceiver and the computer. For residential variations of DSL, this is usually the [[Ethernet]] (RJ-45) port or a [[USB]] port; in rare models, a [[FireWire]] port is used. Older DSL modems sported a native ATM interface (usually, a 25&nbsp;Mbit/s [[serial interface]]). Also, some variations of DSL (such as SDSL) use synchronous serial connections.\n\nModern DSL [[Gateway (telecommunications)|gateways]] have more functionality and usually go through an initialization procedure very similar to a PC [[boot up]]. The system image is loaded from the [[flash memory]]; the system boots, synchronizes the DSL connection and establishes the IP connection between the local network and the service provider, using protocols such as [[DHCP]] or [[PPPoE]]. (According to a 2007 book, the PPPoE method far outweighed DHCP in terms of deployment on DSL lines, and [[Password authentication protocol|PAP]] was the predominant form of subscriber authentication used in such circumstances.)<ref name=\"GoldenDedieu2007b\">{{cite book|author1=Philip Golden|author2=Herv\u00e9 Dedieu|author3=Krista S.

In a bridged configuration, the group of subscriber computers effectively connect into a single subnet. The earliest implementations used [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]] to provide network details such as the [[IP address]] to the subscriber equipment, with [[authentication]] via [[MAC address]] or an assigned host name. Later implementations often use [[Point-to-Point Protocol]] (PPP) to authenticate with a user ID and password, and to provide network details ([[Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet]] (PPPoE) or [[Point-to-Point Protocol over ATM]] (PPPoA)).\n\n==Transmission methods==\nTransmission methods vary by market, region, carrier, and equipment.\n* 2B1Q: [[Two-binary, one-quaternary]], used for IDSL and HDSL\n* CAP: [[Carrierless Amplitude Phase Modulation]] - deprecated in 1996 for ADSL, used for HDSL\n* [[TC-PAM]]: Trellis Coded Pulse Amplitude Modulation, used for [[HDSL2]] and [[SHDSL]]\n* DMT: [[Discrete multitone modulation]], the most common kind, also known as OFDM ([[Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing]])\n\n==DSL technologies==\nDSL technologies (sometimes summarized as '''xDSL''') include:\n*[[Symmetric digital subscriber line]] (SDSL), umbrella term for xDSL where the bitrate is equal in both directions.\n**[[ISDN digital subscriber line]] (IDSL), ISDN based technology that provides a bitrate equivalent to two ISDN bearer and one data channel, 144&nbsp;kbit/s symmetric over one pair\n**[[High bit rate digital subscriber line]] (HDSL), ITU-T G.991.1, the first DSL technology that used a higher frequency spectrum than ISDN, 1,544&nbsp;kbit/s and 2,048&nbsp;kbit/s symmetric services, either on 2 or 3 pairs at 784&nbsp;kbit/s each, 2 pairs at 1,168&nbsp;kbit/s each, or one pair at 2,320&nbsp;kbit/s\n**[[High bit rate digital subscriber line 2|High bit rate digital subscriber line 2/4]] (HDSL2, HDSL4), ANSI, 1,544&nbsp;kbit/s symmetric over one pair (HDSL2) or two pairs (HDSL4)\n**[[Symmetric digital subscriber line]] (SDSL), specific proprietary technology, up to 1,544&nbsp;kbit/s symmetric over one pair\n**[[Single-pair high-speed digital subscriber line]] (G.SHDSL), ITU-T G.991.2, standardized successor of HDSL and proprietary SDSL, up to 5,696&nbsp;kbit/s per pair, up to four pairs\n*[[Asymmetric digital subscriber line]] (ADSL), umbrella term for xDSL where the bitrate is greater in one direction than the other.\n**[[ANSI T1.413 Issue 2]], up to 8&nbsp;Mbit/s and 1&nbsp;Mbit/s\n**[[G.992.1|G.dmt]], ITU-T G.992.1, up to 10&nbsp;Mbit/s and 1&nbsp;Mbit/s\n**[[G.992.2|G.lite]], ITU-T G.992.2, more noise and attenuation resistant than G.dmt, up to 1,536&nbsp;kbit/s and 512&nbsp;kbit/s\n**[[Asymmetric digital subscriber line 2]] (ADSL2), ITU-T G.992.3, up to 12&nbsp;Mbit/s and 3.5&nbsp;Mbit/s\n**[[Asymmetric digital subscriber line 2 plus]] (ADSL2+), ITU-T G.992.5, up to 24&nbsp;Mbit/s and 3.5&nbsp;Mbit/s\n**[[Very-high-bit-rate digital subscriber line]] (VDSL), ITU-T G.993.1, up to 52&nbsp;Mbit/s and 16&nbsp;Mbit/s\n**[[Very-high-bit-rate digital subscriber line 2]] (VDSL2), ITU-T G.993.2, an improved version of VDSL, compatible with ADSL2+, sum of both directions up to 200&nbsp;Mbit/s.
