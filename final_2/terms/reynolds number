The concept was introduced by [[George Gabriel Stokes]] in 1851,<ref name=\"Stokes 1851\" /> but the Reynolds number was named by Arnold Sommerfeld in 1908<ref name=\"Sommerfeld 1908\" /> after [[Osborne Reynolds]] (1842\u20131912), who popularized its use in 1883.<ref name=\"Reynolds 1883\" /><ref name=\"Rott 1990\" />\n\nThe Reynolds number is defined as<ref name=\"Sommerfeld 1908\" />\n\n:<math> \n    \\mathrm{Re}\n    = \\frac{\\rho v L}{\\mu} \n</math>\n\nwhere:\n* {{math|''[[Rho (letter)|\u03c1]]''}} is the [[density]] of the fluid ([[SI units]]: kg/m<sup>3</sup>)\n* {{math|'''v'''}} is a characteristic velocity of the fluid with respect to the object (m/s)\n* {{math|''L''}} is a characteristic linear dimension  (m)\n* {{math|''[[Mu (letter)|\u03bc]]''}} is the [[dynamic viscosity]] of the [[fluid]] (Pa\u00b7s or N\u00b7s/m<sup>2</sup> or kg/(m\u00b7s)).\n\nThe Reynolds number characterizes the [[ratio]] of inertial forces to [[viscous]] forces and consequently quantifies the relative importance of these two types of forces for given flow conditions.<ref name=\"Falkovich\" /> Reynolds numbers frequently arise when performing scaling of fluid dynamics problems, and as such can be used to determine [[dynamic similitude]] between two different cases of fluid flow. They are also used to characterize different flow regimes within a similar fluid, such as [[Laminar flow|laminar]] or [[Turbulence|turbulent flow]]:\n* laminar flow occurs at low Reynolds numbers, where viscous forces are dominant, and is characterized by smooth, constant fluid motion;\n* turbulent flow occurs at high Reynolds numbers and is dominated by inertial forces, which tend to produce chaotic [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]], [[Vortex|vortices]] and other flow instabilities.\n\nIn practice, matching the Reynolds number is not on its own sufficient to guarantee similitude. Fluid flow is generally chaotic, and very small changes to shape and surface roughness can result in very different flows. Nevertheless, Reynolds numbers are a very important guide and are widely used.\n\nReynolds number interpretation has been extended into the area of arbitrary [[complex systems]] as well: financial flows,<ref name=\"CornelisLos\"/> nonlinear networks,<ref name=\"skam\">{{cite journal|last=Kamenshchikov|first=Sergey |title=Extended Prigogine Theorem: Method for Universal Characterization of Complex System Evolution|journal=Chaos and Complexity Letters|year=2013|volume=8|pages=63\u201371|url=https://www.novapublishers.com/catalog/downloadOA.php?order=1&access=true|issue=1}}</ref> etc. In the latter case an artificial viscosity is reduced to nonlinear mechanism of energy distribution in [[complex network]] media. Reynolds number then represents a basic control parameter which expresses a balance between injected and dissipated energy flows for open boundary system. It has been shown <ref name=\"skam\"/> that Reynolds critical regime separates two types of phase space motion: accelerator (attractor) and decelerator. High Reynolds number leads to a chaotic regime transition only in frame of [[strange attractor]] model.\n\nThe Reynolds number can be defined for several different situations where a fluid is in relative motion to a surface.<ref group=\"n\">The definition of the Reynolds number is not to be confused with the [[Reynolds-averaged Navier\u2013Stokes equations|Reynolds equation]] or lubrication equation.</ref> These definitions generally include the fluid properties of density and viscosity, plus a velocity and a [[characteristic length]] or characteristic dimension. This dimension is a matter of convention&nbsp;\u2013 for example radius and diameter are equally valid to describe spheres or circles, but one is chosen by convention. For aircraft or ships, the length or width can be used. For flow in a pipe or a sphere moving in a fluid the internal diameter is generally used today. Other shapes such as rectangular pipes or non-spherical objects have an ''equivalent diameter'' defined. For fluids of variable density such as compressible gases or fluids of variable viscosity such as [[non-Newtonian fluid]]s, special rules apply. The velocity may also be a matter of convention in some circumstances, notably stirred vessels.

The wetted perimeter for a channel is the total perimeter of all channel walls that are in contact with the flow.<ref name=\"Holman\" /> This means the length of the channel exposed to air is ''not'' included in the wetted perimeter.\n\nFor a circular pipe, the hydraulic diameter is exactly equal to the inside pipe diameter, {{math|''D''}}. That is,\n\n:<math>D_H = D.</math>\n\nFor an annular duct, such as the outer channel in a tube-in-tube [[heat exchanger]], the hydraulic diameter can be shown algebraically to reduce to\n\n:<math>D_{H,\\mathrm{annulus}} = D_o - D_i</math>\n\nwhere\n:{{math|''D{{sub|o}}''}} is the inside diameter of the outside pipe, and\n:{{math|''D{{sub|i}}''}} is the outside diameter of the inside pipe.\n\nFor calculations involving flow in non-circular ducts, the hydraulic diameter can be substituted for the diameter of a circular duct, with reasonable accuracy, if the aspect ratio AR of the duct cross-section remains in the range 1/4 < AR < 4.<ref name=\"Fox 2004\" />\n\n==Flow in a wide duct==\n\nFor a fluid moving between two plane parallel surfaces\u2014where the width is much greater than the space between the plates\u2014then the characteristic dimension is equal to the distance between the plates.<ref name=\"Fox 2004\" />\n\n==Flow in an open channel==\n\nFor flow of liquid with a free surface, the [[hydraulic radius]] must be determined. This is the cross-sectional area of the channel divided by the wetted perimeter. For a semi-circular channel, it is half the radius. For a rectangular channel, the hydraulic radius is the cross-sectional area divided by the wetted perimeter. Some texts then use a characteristic dimension that is four times the hydraulic radius, chosen because it gives the same value of Re for the onset of turbulence as in pipe flow,<ref name=\"Streeter 1962\" /> while others use the hydraulic radius as the characteristic length-scale with consequently different values of Re for transition and turbulent flow.\n\n==Flow around airfoils==\n\nReynolds numbers are used in [[airfoil]] design to (among other things) manage \"Scale Effect\" when computing/comparing characteristics (a tiny wing, scaled to be huge, will perform differently).<ref name=\"Lissaman\" /> Fluid dynamicists define the chord Reynolds number, {{math|''R''}}, like this: {{math|''R'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''Vc''|''\u03bd''}}}} where {{math|''V''}} is the flight speed, {{math|''c''}} is the chord length, and {{math|''\u03bd''}} is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid in which the airfoil operates, which is {{val|1.460e-5|u=m<sup>2</sup>/s}} for the atmosphere at [[sea level]].<ref>{{cite web|last=ISO|title=International Standard Atmosphere|url=http://www-mdp.eng.cam.ac.uk/web/library/enginfo/aerothermal_dvd_only/aero/atmos/atmos.html|publisher=eng.cam.ac.uk}}</ref> In some special studies a characteristic length other than chord may be used; rare is the \"span Reynolds number\" which is not to be confused with spanwise stations on a wing where chord is still used.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Uwe Ehrenstein |author2=Christophe Eloy |title=Skin friction on a moving wall and its implications for swimming animals |url=https://www.irphe.fr/~eloy/PDF/JFM2013b.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=11 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Object in a fluid==\nThe Reynolds number for an object in a fluid, called the particle Reynolds number and often denoted {{math|Re{{sub|p}}}}, is important when considering the nature of the surrounding flow, whether or not [[vortex shedding]] will occur, and its fall velocity.\n\n===In viscous fluids===\n\n{{unreferenced section|date = February 2014}}\n[[File:Stokes sphere.svg|thumb|right|200px|Creeping flow past a sphere: [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|streamlines]], drag force {{math|''F''<sub>d</sub>}} and force by gravity {{math|''F''<sub>g</sub>}}.]]\nWhere the viscosity is naturally high, such as polymer solutions and polymer melts, flow is normally laminar. The Reynolds number is very small and [[Stokes' Law]] can be used to measure the [[viscosity]] of the fluid. Spheres are allowed to fall through the fluid and they reach the [[terminal velocity]] quickly, from which the viscosity can be determined.\n\nThe laminar flow of polymer solutions is exploited by animals such as fish and dolphins, who exude viscous solutions from their skin to aid flow over their bodies while swimming. It has been used in yacht racing by owners who want to gain a speed advantage by pumping a polymer solution such as low molecular weight [[polyoxyethylene]] in water, over the wetted surface of the hull.\n\nIt is, however, a problem for mixing of polymers, because turbulence is needed to distribute fine filler (for example) through the material. Inventions such as the \"cavity transfer mixer\" have been developed to produce multiple folds into a moving melt so as to improve [[Mixture|mixing]] efficiency. The device can be fitted onto [[extruder]]s to aid mixing.\n\n===Sphere in a fluid===\n\nFor a sphere in a fluid, the characteristic length-scale is the diameter of the sphere and the characteristic velocity is that of the sphere relative to the fluid some distance away from the sphere, such that the motion of the sphere does not disturb that reference parcel of fluid. The density and viscosity are those belonging to the fluid.<ref name=\"Rhodes 1989\" /> Note that purely laminar flow only exists up to {{math|Re}} = 10 under this definition.\n\nUnder the condition of low {{math|Re}}, the relationship between force and speed of motion is given by [[Stokes' law]].<ref name=\"Dusenbery 2009\" />\n\n===Oblong object in a fluid===\n\nThe equation for an oblong object is identical to that of a sphere, with the object being approximated as an [[ellipsoid]] and the axis of length being chosen as the characteristic length scale. Such considerations are important in natural streams, for example, where there are few perfectly spherical grains. For grains in which measurement of each axis is impractical, sieve diameters are used instead as the characteristic particle length-scale. Both approximations alter the values of the critical Reynolds number.\n\n===Fall velocity===\n\nThe particle Reynolds number is important in determining the fall velocity of a particle. When the particle Reynolds number indicates laminar flow, [[Stokes' law]] can be used to calculate its fall velocity. When the particle Reynolds number indicates turbulent flow, a turbulent drag law must be constructed to model the appropriate settling velocity.\n\n===Packed bed===\nFor fluid flow through a bed, of approximately spherical particles of diameter {{math|''D''}} in contact, if the \"[[porosity|voidage]]\" is {{math|''\u03b5''}} and the \"[[superficial velocity]]\" is {{math|''v<sub>s</sub>''}}, the Reynolds number can be defined as:<ref name=\"Dwivedi 1977\" />\n:<math> \\mathrm{Re} = {{\\rho {\\mathbf v_s} D} \\over {\\mu}}.</math>\nor\n:<math> \\mathrm{Re} = {{\\rho {\\mathbf v_s} D} \\over {\\mu \\varepsilon}}.</math>\nor\n:<math> \\mathrm{Re} = {{\\rho {\\mathbf v_s} D} \\over {\\mu (1-\\varepsilon)}}.</math>\nThe choice of equation depends on the system involved: the first is successful in correlating the data for various types of packed and fludized beds, the second Reynolds number suits for the liquid-phase data, while the third was found successful in correlating the fludized bed data, being first introduced for liquid fluidized bed system.<ref name=\"Dwivedi 1977\" />\n\nLaminar conditions apply up to {{math|Re}} = 10, fully turbulent from {{math|Re}} = 2000.<ref name=\"Rhodes 1989\" />\n\n===Stirred vessel===\nIn a cylindrical vessel stirred by a central rotating paddle, turbine or propeller, the characteristic dimension is the diameter of the agitator {{math|''D''}}. The velocity {{math|''V''}} is {{math|''ND''}} where {{math|''N''}} is the [[angular velocity|rotational speed]]. Then the Reynolds number is:\n\n:<math> \\mathrm{Re} = {{\\rho N D^2} \\over {\\mu}}.</math>\n\n:<math> \\mathrm{Re} = {{\\rho V D} \\over {\\mu}}.</math>\n\nThe system is fully turbulent for values of {{math|Re}} above {{val|10000}}.<ref name=\"Sinnott\" />\n\n==Transition and turbulent flow==\nIn [[boundary layer]] flow over a flat plate, experiments confirm that, after a certain length of flow, a laminar boundary layer will become unstable and turbulent. This instability occurs across different scales and with different fluids, usually when {{math|Re{{sub|''x''}}}} \u2248 {{val|5e5}},<ref name=\"De Witt 1990\" /> where {{math|''x''}} is the distance from the leading edge of the flat plate, and the flow velocity is the [[freestream]] velocity of the fluid outside the boundary layer.\n\nFor flow in a pipe of diameter {{math|''D''}}, experimental observations show that for \"fully developed\" flow,<ref group=\"n\">Full development of the flow occurs as the flow enters the pipe, the boundary layer thickens and then stabilizes after several diameters distance into the pipe.</ref> laminar flow occurs when {{math|Re{{sub|''D''}}}} < 2300 and turbulent flow occurs when {{math|Re{{sub|''D''}}}} > 4000.<ref name=\"Holman 2002-207\" /> In the interval between 2300 and 4000, laminar and turbulent flows are possible and are called \"transition\" flows, depending on other factors, such as pipe roughness and flow uniformity. This result is generalized to non-circular channels using the [[hydraulic diameter]], allowing a transition Reynolds number to be calculated for other shapes of channel.\n\nThese [[laminar-turbulent transition|transition]] Reynolds numbers are also called ''critical Reynolds numbers'', and were studied by Osborne Reynolds around 1895.<ref name=\"Rott 1990\" /> The critical Reynolds number is different for every geometry.<ref name=potter>{{cite book|last=Shih|first=Merle C.

The diagram clearly shows the laminar, transition, and turbulent flow regimes as Reynolds number increases. The nature of pipe flow is strongly dependent on whether the flow is laminar or turbulent.\n\n==Similarity of flows==\n[[File:Reynolds behaviors.png|thumb|Qualitative behaviors of fluid flow over a cylinder depends to a large extent on Reynolds number; similar flow patterns often appear when the shape and Reynolds number is matched, although other parameters like surface roughness have a big effect]]\nIn order for two flows to be similar they must have the same geometry, and have equal Reynolds numbers and [[Euler number (physics)|Euler numbers]]. When comparing fluid behavior at corresponding points in a model and a full-scale flow, the following holds:\n\n:<math> \\mathrm{Re}_\\mathrm{m} = \\mathrm{Re} \\; </math>\n\n: <math> \\mathrm{Eu}_\\mathrm{m} = \\mathrm{Eu} \\; \\quad\\quad \\mbox{i.e.} \\quad {p_\\mathrm{m} \\over \\rho_\\mathrm{m} {v_\\mathrm{m}}^{2}} = {p\\over \\rho v^{2}} \\; , </math>\n\nquantities marked with {{math|m}} concern the flow around the model and the others the actual flow. This allows engineers to perform experiments with reduced models in [[Water tunnel (hydrodynamic)|water channel]]s or [[wind tunnel]]s, and correlate the data to the actual flows, saving on costs during experimentation and on lab time. Note that true dynamic similitude may require matching other [[dimensionless number]]s as well, such as the [[Mach number]] used in [[compressible flow]]s, or the [[Froude number]] that governs open-channel flows. Some flows involve more dimensionless parameters than can be practically satisfied with the available apparatus and fluids, so one is forced to decide which parameters are most important. For experimental flow modeling to be useful, it requires a fair amount of experience and judgement of the engineer.\n\nAn example where the mere Reynolds number is not sufficient for similarity of flows (or even the flow regime \u2013 laminar or turbulent) are bounded flows, i.e. flows that are restricted by walls or other boundaries. A classical example of this is the [[Taylor\u2013Couette flow]], where the dimensionless ratio of radii of bounding cylinders is also important, and many technical applications where these distinctions play an important role.<ref>[http://rheologic.net/en/cfd-simulation-laminar-and-turbulent-flow#disk_diag restricted flow in industry application]</ref><ref>[http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Transition_to_turbulence article about flow restrictions]</ref> Principles of these restrictions were developed by [[Maurice Marie Alfred Couette]] and [[Geoffrey Ingram Taylor]] and developed further by [[Floris Takens]] and [[David Ruelle]].\n\n;Typical values of Reynolds number<ref>{{cite journal |last=Patel |first=V.

The size of the largest scales of fluid motion (sometimes called eddies) are set by the overall geometry of the flow. For instance, in an industrial smoke stack, the largest scales of fluid motion are as big as the diameter of the stack itself. The size of the smallest scales is set by the Reynolds number. As the Reynolds number increases, smaller and smaller scales of the flow are visible. In a smoke stack, the smoke may appear to have many very small velocity perturbations or eddies, in addition to large bulky eddies. In this sense, the Reynolds number is an indicator of the range of scales in the flow. The higher the Reynolds number, the greater the range of scales. The largest eddies will always be the same size; the smallest eddies are determined by the Reynolds number.\n\nWhat is the explanation for this phenomenon? A large Reynolds number indicates that viscous forces are not important at large scales of the flow. With a strong predominance of inertial forces over viscous forces, the largest scales of fluid motion are undamped\u2014there is not enough viscosity to dissipate their motions. The kinetic energy must \"cascade\" from these large scales to progressively smaller scales until a level is reached for which the scale is small enough for viscosity to become important (that is, viscous forces become of the order of inertial ones). It is at these small scales where the dissipation of energy by viscous action finally takes place. The Reynolds number indicates at what scale this viscous dissipation occurs.\n\n==In physiology==\n{{unreferenced section|date= December 2014}}\n[[Poiseuille's law]] on blood circulation in the body is dependent on [[laminar flow]]. In turbulent flow the flow rate is proportional to the square root of the pressure gradient, as opposed to its direct proportionality to pressure gradient in laminar flow.\n\nUsing the definition of the Reynolds number we can see that a large diameter with rapid flow, where the density of the blood is high, tends towards turbulence. Rapid changes in vessel diameter may lead to turbulent flow, for instance when a narrower vessel widens to a larger one. Furthermore, a bulge of [[atheroma]] may be the cause of turbulent flow, where audible turbulence may be detected with a stethoscope.\n\n==Derivation==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}\nThe Reynolds number can be obtained when one uses the [[nondimensional number|nondimensional]] form of the incompressible [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]] for a newtonian fluid expressed in terms of the [[Lagrangian derivative]]:\n:<math>\\rho \\frac{D \\mathbf{v}}{D t} = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v} + \\rho \\mathbf{f}. </math>\n\nEach term in the above equation has the units of a \"body force\" (force per unit volume) with the same dimensions of a density times an acceleration. Each term is thus dependent on the exact measurements of a flow. When one renders the equation nondimensional, that is when we multiply it by a factor with inverse units of the base equation, we obtain a form which does not depend directly on the physical sizes. One possible way to obtain a nondimensional equation is to multiply the whole equation by the following factor:\n:<math> L \\over \\rho V^2 </math>\nwhere:\n* {{math|''V''}} is the mean velocity, {{math|''v''}} or {{math|{{overline|'''v'''}}}}, relative to the fluid (m/s).\n* {{math|''L''}} is the characteristic length (m).\n* {{math|''\u03c1''}} is the fluid density (kg/m<sup>3</sup>).\n\nIf we now set:\n:<math> \\mathbf{v'} = \\frac{\\mathbf{v}}{V},\\ p' = p\\frac{1}{\\rho V^2}, \\ \\mathbf{f'} = \\mathbf{f}\\frac{L}{V^2}, \\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t'} = \\frac{L}{V} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}, \\ \\nabla' = L \\nabla </math>\n\nwe can rewrite the Navier\u2013Stokes equation without dimensions:\n:<math>\\frac{D \\mathbf{v'}}{D t'} = -\\nabla' p' + \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho L V} \\nabla'^2 \\mathbf{v'} + \\mathbf{f'} </math>\n\nwhere the term {{math|{{sfrac|''\u03bc''|''\u03c1LV''}} {{=}} {{sfrac|1|Re}}}}.\n\nFinally, dropping the primes for ease of reading:\n:<math>\\frac{D \\mathbf{v}}{D t} = -\\nabla p + \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{Re}} \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{f}. </math>\n\nThis is why mathematically all Newtonian, incompressible flows with the same Reynolds number are comparable. Notice also, in the above equation, as {{math|Re \u2192 \u221e}} the viscous terms vanish. Thus, high Reynolds number flows are approximately inviscid in the free-stream.\n\n==Relationship to other dimensionless parameters==\nThere are many [[dimensionless numbers in fluid mechanics]]. The Reynolds number measures the ratio of advection and diffusion effects on structures in the velocity field, and is therefore closely related to [[P\u00e9clet number]]s, which measure the ratio of these effects on other fields carried by the flow, for example temperature and magnetic fields. Replacement of the [[Viscosity#Kinematic viscosity|kinematic viscosity]] {{math|''\u03bd'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''\u03bc''|''\u03c1''}}}} in {{math|Re}} by the thermal or magnetic diffusivity results in respectively the thermal P\u00e9clet number and the [[magnetic Reynolds number]]. These are therefore related to {{math|Re}} by products with ratios of diffusivities, namely the [[Prandtl number]] and [[magnetic Prandtl number]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Reynolds transport theorem]]\n* [[Drag coefficient]]\n* [[Deposition (geology)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"Stokes 1851\">{{cite journal |last=Stokes |first=George |authorlink=George Gabriel Stokes |year=1851 |title=On the Effect of the Internal Friction of Fluids on the Motion of Pendulums |journal=[[Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society]] |volume=9 |pages=8\u2013106 |bibcode = 1851TCaPS...9....8S }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Reynolds 1883\">{{cite journal | last = Reynolds | first = Osborne | authorlink = Osborne Reynolds | year = 1883| title = An experimental investigation of the circumstances which determine whether the motion of water shall be direct or sinuous, and of the law of resistance in parallel channels | journal = [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]] | volume = 174 | issue = 0| pages = 935\u2013982 | jstor=109431 | doi = 10.1098/rstl.1883.0029 }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Rott 1990\">{{cite journal |last=Rott |first=N. |title=Note on the history of the Reynolds number |journal=[[Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics]] |volume=22 |issue=1 |year=1990 |pages=1\u201311 |doi=10.1146/annurev.fl.22.010190.000245 |bibcode = 1990AnRFM..22....1R }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Sommerfeld 1908\">{{cite journal |last=Sommerfeld |first=Arnold |authorlink=Arnold Sommerfeld |year=1908 |title=Ein Beitrag zur hydrodynamischen Erkl\u00e4erung der turbulenten Fl\u00fcssigkeitsbeweg\u00fcngen (A Contribution to Hydrodynamic Explanation of Turbulent Fluid Motions) |journal=[[International Congress of Mathematicians ]] |volume=3 |pages=116-124 }}[http://www.mathunion.org/ICM/ICM1908.3/Main/icm1908.3.0116.0124.ocr.pdf]</ref><!--ref name=\"NASA\">[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/BGH/reynolds.html Reynolds Number]</ref-->\n<ref name=\"CornelisLos\">{{cite book |last=Los |first=C. |title=Financial Market Risk: Measurement and Analysis |publisher=Routledge |year=2003 |url=http://www.routledge.com/}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Falkovich\">{{cite book |last=Falkovich |first=G. |title=Fluid Mechanics |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2011 |url=http://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/falkovich/fluid-mechanics}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Lissaman\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.fl.15.010183.001255 |title=Low-Reynolds-Number Airfoils, |author=P.
