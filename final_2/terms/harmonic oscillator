Depending on the friction coefficient, the system can:\n\n* Oscillate with a frequency lower than in the non-damped case, and an [[amplitude]] decreasing with time (''underdamped'' oscillator).\n* Decay to the equilibrium position, without oscillations (''overdamped'' oscillator).\n\nThe boundary solution between an underdamped oscillator and an overdamped oscillator occurs at a particular value of the friction coefficient and is called \"critically damped.\"\n\nIf an external time dependent force is present, the harmonic oscillator is described as a '''driven oscillator'''.\n\nMechanical examples include [[pendulum]]s (with [[Small-angle approximation#Motion of a pendulum|small angles of displacement]]), masses connected to [[spring (device)|spring]]s, and [[acoustics|acoustical system]]s. Other [[#Equivalent systems|analogous systems]] include electrical harmonic oscillators such as [[RLC circuit]]s.  The harmonic oscillator model is very important in physics, because any mass subject to a force in stable equilibrium acts as a harmonic oscillator for small vibrations.  Harmonic oscillators occur widely in nature and are exploited in many manmade devices, such as [[clock]]s and radio circuits.  They are the source of virtually all sinusoidal vibrations and waves.\n\n== Simple harmonic oscillator ==\n{{main|Simple harmonic motion}}\n[[Image:Simple harmonic motion animation.gif|thumb|right|Simple harmonic motion]]\nA simple harmonic oscillator is an oscillator that is neither driven nor [[Damping|damped]]. It consists of a mass ''m'', which experiences a single force, ''F'', which pulls the mass in the direction of the point ''x''=0 and depends only on the mass's position ''x'' and a constant ''k''. Balance of forces ([[Newton's second law]]) for the system is\n\n:<math>F = m a = m \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2x}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} = m\\ddot{x} = -k x. </math>\n\nSolving this [[differential equation]], we find that the motion is described by the function\n\n:<math> x(t) = A\\cos\\left( \\omega t+\\phi\\right), </math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{T}.</math>\n\nThe motion is [[Periodic function|periodic]], repeating itself in a [[sine wave|sinusoidal]] fashion with constant amplitude, ''A''. In addition to its amplitude, the motion of a simple harmonic oscillator is characterized by its [[Frequency|period]] ''T'', the time for a single oscillation or its frequency ''f''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{frac|''T''}}, the number of cycles per unit time. The position at a given time ''t'' also depends on the [[phase (waves)|phase]], ''\u03c6'', which determines the starting point on the sine wave. The period and frequency are determined by the size of the mass ''m'' and the force constant ''k'', while the amplitude and phase are determined by the starting position and [[velocity]].\n\nThe velocity and [[acceleration]] of a simple harmonic oscillator oscillate with the same frequency as the position but with shifted phases.  The velocity is maximum for zero displacement, while the acceleration is in the opposite direction as the displacement.\n\nThe potential energy stored in a simple harmonic oscillator at position ''x'' is\n\n:<math>U = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2.</math>\n\n== Damped harmonic oscillator ==\n{{main|Damping}}\n[[File:Damping 1.svg|thumb|200px|Dependence of the system behavior on the value of the damping ratio ''\u03b6'']]\n[[File:Oscillatory motion acceleration.ogv|thumb|A damped harmonic oscillator, which slows down due to friction]]\n[[File:Guitar strings.jpg|thumb|Another damped harmonic oscillator]]\nIn real oscillators, friction, or damping, slows the motion of the system. Due to frictional force, the velocity decreases in proportion to the acting frictional force. While simple harmonic motion oscillates with only the restoring force acting on the system, damped harmonic motion experiences friction. In many vibrating systems the frictional force ''F''<sub>f</sub> can be modeled as being proportional to the velocity ''v'' of the object: {{nowrap|1=''F''<sub>f</sub> = \u2212''cv''}}, where ''c'' is called the ''viscous damping coefficient''.\n\nBalance of forces ([[Newton's second law]]) for damped harmonic oscillators is then\n\n:<math> F = F_{ext} - kx - c\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} = m \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2x}{\\mathrm{d}t^2}.</math>\n\nWhen no external forces are present (i.e. when <math>F_{ext}=0</math>), this can be rewritten into the form\n\n:<math> \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2x}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} + 2\\zeta\\omega_0\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\omega_0^{\\,2} x = 0, </math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}</math> is called the 'undamped [[angular frequency]] of the oscillator' and\n\n:<math>\\zeta = \\frac{c}{2 \\sqrt{mk}}</math> is called the 'damping ratio'.\n\n[[Image:Step response for two-pole feedback amplifier.PNG|thumbnail|200px|Step-response of a damped harmonic oscillator; curves are plotted for three values of {{nowrap|1=''\u03bc'' = ''\u03c9''<sub>1</sub> = ''\u03c9''<sub>0</sub>{{radic|1\u2212''\u03b6''<sup>2</sup>}}}}.

A damped harmonic oscillator can be:\n*''Overdamped'' (''\u03b6'' > 1): The system returns ([[exponential decay|exponentially decays]]) to steady state without oscillating.  Larger values of the damping ratio ''\u03b6'' return to equilibrium slower.\n*''Critically damped'' (''\u03b6'' = 1):  The system returns to steady state as quickly as possible without oscillating (although overshoot can occur).  This is often desired for the damping of systems such as doors.\n*''Underdamped'' (''\u03b6'' < 1): The system oscillates (with a slightly different frequency than the undamped case) with the amplitude gradually decreasing to zero. The [[angular frequency]] of the underdamped harmonic oscillator is given by <math>\\omega_1 = \\omega_0\\sqrt{1 - \\zeta^2},</math> the [[exponential decay]] of the underdamped harmonic oscillator is given by <math>\\lambda = \\omega_0\\zeta.</math>\n\nThe [[Q factor]] of a damped oscillator is defined as \n:<math>Q = 2\\pi \\times \\frac{\\text{Energy stored}}{\\text{Energy lost per cycle}}.</math>\n\n''Q'' is related to the damping ratio by the equation <math>Q = \\frac{1}{2\\zeta}.</math>\n\n== Driven harmonic oscillators == <!-- Driving DAB entry and [[Stiff equation]] link here, pls do not change -->\n\nDriven harmonic oscillators are damped oscillators further affected by an externally applied force ''F''(''t'').\n\n[[Newton's second law]] takes the form\n\n:<math>F(t)-kx-c\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t}=m\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2x}{\\mathrm{d}t^2}. </math>\n\nIt is usually rewritten into the form\n\n:<math> \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2x}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} + 2\\zeta\\omega_0\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\omega_0^2 x = \\frac{F(t)}{m}. </math>\n\nThis equation can be solved exactly for any driving force, using the solutions ''z''(''t'') which satisfy the unforced equation:\n\n:<math> \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2z}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} + 2\\zeta\\omega_0\\frac{\\mathrm{d}z}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\omega_0^2 z = 0,</math>\n\nand which can be expressed as damped sinusoidal oscillations,\n\n:<math>z(t) = A \\mathrm{e}^{-\\zeta \\omega_0 t} \\ \\sin \\left( \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2} \\ \\omega_0 t + \\varphi \\right), </math>\n\nin the case where ''\u03b6''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;1.

The term ''overshoot'' refers to the extent the maximum response exceeds final value, and ''undershoot'' refers to the extent the response falls below final value for times following the maximum response.\n\n===Sinusoidal driving force===\n[[File:Mplwp resonance zeta envelope.svg|thumb|300px|Steady state variation of amplitude with relative frequency <math>\\omega/\\omega_0</math> and [[damping|damping <math>\\zeta</math>]] of a driven [[simple harmonic oscillator]].]]\n<!--<ref>{{cite book|last=Ogata|first=Katsuhiko|title=System dynamics|year=2004|publisher=Pearson Education|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=9780131247147|edition=4th}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite book\n | title = Optics, 3E\n | author = [[Ajoy Ghatak]]\n | edition = 3rd\n | publisher = Tata McGraw-Hill\n | year = 2005\n | isbn = 978-0-07-058583-6\n | page = 6.10\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jStDc2LmU5IC&pg=PT97 \n }}</ref>\n-->\n\nIn the case of a sinusoidal driving force:\n\n:<math> \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2x}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} + 2\\zeta\\omega_0\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\omega_0^2 x = \\frac{1}{m} F_0 \\sin(\\omega t),</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\,\\!F_0</math> is the driving amplitude and <math>\\,\\!\\omega</math> is the driving [[frequency]] for a sinusoidal driving mechanism.

The varying of the parameters drives the system.  Examples of parameters that may be varied are its resonance frequency <math>\\omega</math> and damping <math>\\beta</math>.\n\nParametric oscillators are used in many applications.  The classical [[varactor]] parametric oscillator oscillates when the diode's capacitance is varied periodically.  The circuit that varies the diode's capacitance is called the \"pump\" or \"driver\".   In microwave electronics, [[waveguide (electromagnetism)|waveguide]]/[[Yttrium aluminum garnet|YAG]] based parametric oscillators operate in the same fashion. The designer varies a parameter periodically to induce oscillations.\n\nParametric oscillators have been developed as low-noise amplifiers, especially in the radio and microwave frequency range.  Thermal noise is minimal, since a reactance (not a resistance) is varied.  Another common use is frequency conversion, e.g., conversion from audio to radio frequencies.  For example, the [[Optical parametric oscillator]] converts an input [[laser]] wave into two output waves of lower frequency (<math>\\omega_s, \\omega_i</math>).\n\nParametric resonance occurs in a mechanical system when a system is parametrically excited and oscillates at one of its resonant frequencies. Parametric excitation differs from forcing, since the action appears as a time varying modification on a system parameter. This effect is different from regular resonance because it exhibits the [[instability]] phenomenon.\n\n==Universal oscillator equation==\nThe equation \n:<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2q}{\\mathrm{d} \\tau^2} + 2 \\zeta \\frac{\\mathrm{d}q}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau} + q = 0</math>\n\nis known as the '''universal oscillator equation''' since all second order linear oscillatory systems can be reduced to this form.

The potential energy function of a harmonic oscillator is:\n\n:<math>V(x) = \\frac{1}{2} k x^2</math>\n\nGiven an arbitrary potential energy function <math>V(x)</math>, one can do a [[Taylor series|Taylor expansion]] in terms of <math>x</math> around an energy minimum (<math>x = x_0</math>) to model the behavior of small perturbations from equilibrium.\n\n:<math>V(x) = V(x_0) + (x-x_0) V'(x_0) + \\frac{1}{2} (x-x_0)^2 V^{(2)}(x_0) + O(x-x_0)^3</math>\n\nBecause <math>V(x_0)</math> is a minimum, the first derivative evaluated at <math>x_0</math> must be zero, so the linear term drops out:\n\n:<math>V(x) = V(x_0) + \\frac{1}{2} (x-x_0)^2 V^{(2)}(x_0) + O(x-x_0)^3</math>\n\nThe [[constant term]] ''V''(''x''<sub>0</sub>) is arbitrary and thus may be dropped, and a coordinate transformation allows the form of the simple harmonic oscillator to be retrieved:\n\n:<math>V(x) \\approx \\frac{1}{2} x^2 V^{(2)}(0) = \\frac{1}{2} k x^2</math>\n\nThus, given an arbitrary potential energy function <math>V(x)</math> with a non-vanishing second derivative, one can use the solution to the simple harmonic oscillator to provide an approximate solution for small perturbations around the equilibrium point.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Simple pendulum===\n[[Image:Simple pendulum height.svg|thumb|right|250px|A [[simple pendulum]] exhibits approximately simple harmonic motion under the conditions of no damping and small amplitude.]]\n\nAssuming no damping, the differential equation governing a simple pendulum is\n\n:<math>\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2}+\\frac{g}{\\ell}\\sin\\theta=0.</math>\n\nIf the maximum displacement of the pendulum is small, we can use the approximation <math>\\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta</math> and instead consider the equation\n\n:<math>\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2}+\\frac{g}{\\ell}\\theta=0.</math>\n\nThe solution to this equation is given by:\n\n:<math>\\theta(t) = \\theta_0\\cos\\left(\\sqrt{g\\over \\ell}t\\right)</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\theta_0</math> is the largest angle attained by the pendulum.  The [[Sine|period]], the time for one complete oscillation, is given by the expression\n\n:<math>T_0 = 2\\pi\\sqrt\\frac{\\ell}{g},</math>\n\nwhich is a good approximation of the actual period when <math>\\theta_0</math> is small.\n\n===Pendulum swinging over turntable===\nSimple harmonic motion can in some cases be considered to be the one-dimensional [[Projection (mathematics)|projection]] of two-dimensional [[circular motion]]. Consider a long [[pendulum]] swinging over the turntable of a [[record player]]. On the edge of the turntable there is an object. If the object is viewed from the same level as the turntable, a projection of the motion of the object seems to be moving backwards and forwards on a straight line orthogonal to the view direction, sinusoidally like the pendulum.\n\n===Spring/mass system===\n[[Image:Harmonic oscillator.svg|thumb|right|250px|Spring\u2013mass system in equilibrium (A), compressed (B) and stretched (C) states.]]\n\nWhen a spring is stretched or compressed by a mass, the spring develops a restoring force. [[Hooke's law]] gives the relationship of the force exerted by the spring when the spring is compressed or stretched a certain length:\n\n:<math>F \\left( t \\right) =-kx \\left( t \\right) </math>\n\nwhere ''F'' is the force, ''k'' is the spring constant, and ''x'' is the displacement of the mass with respect to the equilibrium position. The minus sign in the equation indicates that the force exerted by the spring always acts in a direction that is opposite to the displacement (i.e. the force always acts towards the zero position), and so prevents the mass from flying off to infinity.\n\nBy using either force balance or an energy method, it can be readily shown that the motion of this system is given by the following differential equation:\n\n:<math> F(t) = -kx(t) = m \\frac {\\mathrm{d}^{2}}{\\mathrm{d}{t}^{2}} x \\left( t \\right) = ma. </math>\n\n...the latter being [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's second law|Newton's second law of motion]].\n\nIf the initial displacement is A, and there is no initial velocity, the solution of this equation is given by:\n:<math> x \\left( t \\right) =A \\cos \\left( \\sqrt{k \\over m}t \\right).</math>\n\nGiven an ideal massless spring, <math>m</math> is the mass on the end of the spring. If the spring itself has mass, its [[Effective mass (spring-mass system)|effective mass]] must be included in <math>m</math>.\n\n====Energy variation in the spring\u2013damping system====\nIn terms of energy, all systems have two types of energy, [[potential energy]] and [[kinetic energy]]. When a spring is stretched or compressed, it stores elastic potential energy, which then is transferred into kinetic energy. The potential energy within a spring is determined by the equation <math> U = k{x}^{2}/ 2 . </math>\n\nWhen the spring is stretched or compressed, kinetic energy of the mass gets converted into potential energy of the spring. By conservation of energy, assuming the datum is defined at the equilibrium position, when the spring reaches its maximum potential energy, the kinetic energy of the mass is zero. When the spring is released, it tries to return to equilibrium, and all its potential energy converts to kinetic energy of the mass.\n\n==Definition of terms==\n\n{| class='wikitable'\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Symbol !! scope=\"col\" |  Definition!! scope=\"col\" | Dimensions !! scope=\"col\" | SI units \n|-\n|<math>a</math>||Acceleration of mass||<math>\\mathbf{LT^{-2}}</math>|| meter / second<sup>2</sup> \n|-\n|<math>A</math>||Peak amplitude of oscillation||<math>\\mathbf{L}</math>||meter \n|-\n|<math>c</math>||Viscous damping force||<math>\\mathbf{MT^{-3}}</math>||newton second / meter \n|-\n|<math>F</math>||Drive force||<math>\\mathbf{MLT^{-2}}</math>||newton \n|-\n|<math>g</math>||Acceleration of gravity at the Earth's surface||<math>\\mathbf{LT^{-2}}</math>|| meter / second<sup>2</sup> \n|-\n|<math>i</math>||Imaginary unit, <math>\\sqrt{-1}</math>|| - || - \n|-\n|<math>k</math>||Spring constant||<math>\\mathbf{MT^{-2}}</math>||newton / meter \n|-\n|<math>m, M</math>||Mass||<math>\\mathbf{M}</math>||kilogram \n|-\n|<math>Q</math>||Quality factor||-||-\n|-\n|<math>T</math>||Period of oscillation||<math>\\mathbf{T}</math>||second \n|-\n|<math>t</math>||Time||<math>\\mathbf{T}</math>||second \n|-\n|<math>U</math>||Potential energy stored in oscillator||<math>\\mathbf{ML^2T^{-2}}</math>||joule \n|-\n|<math>x</math>||Position of mass||<math>\\mathbf{L}</math>||meter \n|-\n|<math>\\zeta</math>||Damping ratio||<math>\\mathbf{T^{-1}}</math>|| 1/second \n|-\n|<math>\\phi</math>||Phase shift|| - ||radian \n|-\n|<math>\\omega</math>||Angular frequency||<math>\\mathbf{T^{-1}}</math>||radian / second \n|-\n|<math>\\omega_0</math>||Natural resonant frequency ||<math>\\mathbf{T^{-1}}</math>||radian / second \n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Anharmonic oscillator]]\n*[[Critical speed]]\n*[[Effective mass (spring-mass system)]]\n*[[Normal mode]]\n*[[Parametric oscillator]]\n*[[Phasor]]\n*[[Q factor]]\n*[[Quantum harmonic oscillator]]\n*[[Bertrand's theorem#Radial harmonic oscillator|Radial harmonic oscillator]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book | last1 = Serway | first1 =  Raymond A. | last2 =  Jewett|first2=John W. | title = Physics for Scientists and Engineers | publisher = Brooks/Cole | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-534-40842-7 }}\n* {{cite book | last1 = Tipler | first1 =  Paul | title = Physics for Scientists and Engineers: Vol. 1 | edition = 4th | publisher = W.
