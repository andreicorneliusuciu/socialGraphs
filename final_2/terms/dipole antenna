Each side of the [[feedline]] to the transmitter or receiver is connected to one of the conductors.  This contrasts with a [[monopole antenna]], which consists of a single rod or conductor  with one side of the [[feedline]] connected to it, and the other side connected to some type of [[ground (electricity)|ground]].<ref name=\"Balanis\" />  A common example of a dipole is the \"rabbit ears\" [[television antenna]] found on broadcast television sets.\n\nThe most common form of dipole is two straight rods or wires oriented end to end on the same axis, with the feedline connected to the two adjacent ends.  This is the simplest type of antenna from a theoretical point of view.<ref name=\"Winder\" />  Dipoles are [[Antenna (radio)#Resonant antennas|resonant antennas]], meaning that the elements serve as [[resonator]]s, with [[standing wave]]s of radio current flowing back and forth between their ends.

The [[radiation pattern]] of a vertical dipole is [[omnidirectional antenna|omnidirectional]]; it radiates equal power in all [[azimuth]]al directions perpendicular to the axis of the antenna.  For a half-wave dipole the radiation is maximum, 2.15 dBi perpendicular to the antenna axis, falling monotonically with elevation angle to zero on the axis, off the ends of the antenna.<ref name=\"Stutzman\">{{cite book\n | last1  = Stutzman\n | first1 = Warren L.\n | last2  = Thiele\n | first2 = Gary A.\n | title  = Antenna Theory and Design\n | publisher = John Wiley and Sons\n | date   = 2012\n | location = \n | pages  = 74\u201375\n | language = \n | url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=xhZRA1K57wIC&pg=RA1-PA75&dq=%22half+wave+dipole\n | doi    = \n | id     = \n | isbn   = 0470576642\n }}</ref>\n\nSeveral different variations of the dipole are also used, such as the ''folded dipole'', ''short dipole'', ''cage dipole'', ''bow-tie'', and ''[[batwing antenna]]''. Dipoles may be used as standalone antennas themselves, but they are also employed as [[antenna feed|feed antenna]]s ([[driven element]]s) in many more complex antenna types,<ref name=\"Basu\" /><ref name=\"RadioElectronics\" /> such as the [[Yagi-Uda antenna|Yagi antenna]], [[parabolic antenna]], [[reflective array antenna|reflective array]],  [[turnstile antenna]],  [[log periodic antenna]], and [[phased array]]. The dipole was the earliest type of antenna; it was invented by German physicist [[Heinrich Hertz]] around 1886 in his pioneering investigations of [[radio wave]]s.\n\n==Dipole characteristics==\n\n===Impedance of dipoles of various lengths===\n[[File:Dipole_antenna_standing_waves_animation_461x217x150ms.gif|thumb|upright=1.6|Animation showing the sinusoidal [[standing wave]]s of voltage ''(<span style=\"color:red;\">V, red</span>)'' and current ''(<span style=\"color:blue;\">I, blue</span>)''  on a half-wave dipole driven by an AC voltage at its [[resonant frequency]]. ]]\n[[Image:DipoleImpedance-wide.png|thumb|300px|Real (black) and imaginary (blue) parts of the dipole feedpoint impedance versus total length in wavelengths, assuming a conductor diameter of .001 wavelengths]]\n\nThe feedpoint impedance of a dipole antenna is very sensitive to its [[electrical length]]. Therefore, a dipole will generally only perform optimally over a rather narrow bandwidth, beyond which its impedance will become a poor match for the transmitter or receiver (and transmission line). The real (resistive) and imaginary (reactive) components of that impedance, as a function of electrical length, are shown in the accompanying graph. The detailed calculation of these numbers are described [[#Detailed calculation of dipole feedpoint impedance|below]]. Note that the value of the reactance is highly dependent on the diameter of the conductors; this plot is for conductors with a diameter of .001 wavelengths.\n\nDipoles that are much smaller than the wavelength of the signal are called ''short dipoles''. These have a very low [[radiation resistance]] (and a high capacitive [[Reactance (electronics)|reactance]]) making them inefficient antennas. More of a transmitter's current is dissipated as heat due to the finite resistance of the conductors which is greater than the radiation resistance. However they can nevertheless be practical receiving antennas for longer wavelengths.<ref>Below 30&nbsp;MHz, [[atmospheric noise]] is high; consequently, received power levels must be significantly above the thermal noise floor. The receiving antenna's inefficiency is masked by the higher power level. See Rohde, Communications Receivers, discussion on active antennas.</ref>\n\nDipoles whose length is approximately half the wavelength of the signal are called ''half-wave dipoles'' and are widely used as such or as the basis for derivative antenna designs. These have a radiation resistance which is much greater, closer to the characteristic impedances of available [[transmission line]]s, and normally much larger than the resistance of the conductors, so that their [[antenna efficiency|efficiency]] approaches 100%. In general radio engineering, the term ''dipole'', if not further qualified, is taken to mean a center-fed half-wave dipole.\n\n[[Image:DipoleImpedance.png|thumb|300px|Feedpoint impedance of (near-) half-wave dipoles versus electrical length in wavelengths. Black: [[radiation resistance]]; blue: reactance for 4 different values of conductor diameter]]\nA true half-wave dipole is one half of the wavelength \u03bb in length, where \u03bb=c/f in free space. Such a dipole has a feedpoint impedance consisting of 73\u03a9 resistance and +43\u03a9 reactance, thus presenting a slightly inductive reactance. In order to cancel that reactance, and present a pure resistance to the feedline, the element is shortened by the factor ''k'' for a net length ''l'' of:\n\n:<math>l=   \\frac{1}{2} k \\lambda  = \\frac{1}{2} k \\frac{c}{f}</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03bb'' is the free-space wavelength, ''c'' is the [[speed of light]], and ''f'' is the frequency. The adjustment factor ''k'', in order for the reactance to be cancelled, depends on the diameter of the conductor.<ref name=\"Amlaner\">{{cite conference\n  | last1  = Amlaner\n  | first1 = Charles J.

This is because the effect of antenna length on reactance is much greater for thinner conductors. For the same reason, antennas with thicker conductors have a wider operating bandwidth over which they attain an acceptable [[standing wave ratio]].\n\nFor a typical ''k'' of about .95, the above formula is often written for a length in metres of 143/''f'' or a length in feet of 468/''f'' where ''f'' is the frequency in megahertz.<ref>[http://www.ycars.org/EFRA/Module%20C/AntDip.htm ycars.org - Reflections and standing wave ratio], 2011-01-30</ref>\n\nDipole antennas of lengths approximately equal to any ''odd'' multiple of \u03bb/2 are also resonant, presenting a small reactance (which can be cancelled by a small length adjustment). However these are rarely used. One size that is more practical though is a dipole with a length of 5/4 wavelengths. Not being close to 3/2 wavelengths, this antenna's impedance has a large (negative) reactance and can only be used with an [[impedance matching]] network (or \"[[antenna tuner]]\"). It is a desirable length because such an antenna has the highest gain for any dipole which isn't a great deal longer.\n\n===Radiation pattern and gain===\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Dipole xmting antenna animation 4 408x318x150ms.gif\n| caption1  = Animation showing [[electric field]]s of a radiating vertical half-wave dipole antenna.\n| image2    = L-over2-rad-pat-per.jpg\n| caption2  = Three dimensional radiation pattern of a vertical half-wave dipole antenna. \n| height    = 260\n| footer    = \n}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 200\n| image2    = RadPatt-lin.png\n| image3    = RadPatt-dB.png\n| footer    = Radiation pattern of vertical half-wave dipole; vertical section.<br/>''(top)'' In linear scale<br/> ''(bottom)'' In decibels isotropic (dBi)\n}}\nA bare dipole is ''not'' considered a directional antenna. However like all antennas, its radiation is not uniform in all directions. Its [[radiation pattern]] in three dimensions is shaped like a [[toroid]] (doughnut) symmetric about the axis of the dipole. The radiation is maximum at right angles to the dipole, dropping off to zero on the antenna's axis. Therefore, a dipole mounted vertically will be [[Omnidirectional antenna|omnidirectional]] in the horizontal plane, with a modest gain, at the expense of radiation in the vertical direction.\n\nDipoles mounted horizontally (as is more common) will have gain in two opposing horizontal directions but nodes (directions of zero gain) at 90\u00b0 from those directions (along the direction of the conductor). Neglecting electrical inefficiency, the [[antenna gain]] is equal to the [[Directivity|directive gain]], which is 1.5 or 1.76 dBi for a short dipole, increasing to 1.64 or 2.15 dBi for a half-wave dipole. For a 5/4 wave dipole the gain further increases to about 5.2 dBi, making this length desirable for that reason even though the antenna is then off-resonance. Longer dipoles than that have radiation patterns that are multi-lobed, with poorer gain (unless they are ''much'' longer) even along the strongest lobe. Other enhancements to the dipole (such as including a [[Corner reflector antenna|corner reflector]] or an [[#Dipole arrays|array]] of dipoles) can be considered when more substantial directivity is desired. Such antenna designs, although based on the half-wave dipole, generally acquire their own names.\n\n==Feeding a dipole antenna==\nIdeally, a half-wave dipole should be fed using a balanced transmission line matching its typical 65-70 \u03a9 input impedance. [[Twin lead]] with a similar impedance is available but seldom used.\n\nMany types of [[coaxial cable]] have a characteristic impedance of 75 \u03a9, which would therefore be a good match for a half-wave dipole, however coax is an unbalanced transmission line (with one terminal at ground potential) whereas a dipole antenna presents a balanced input (both terminals have an equal but opposite voltage with respect to ground). When a balanced antenna is fed with a single-ended line, common mode currents can cause the coax line to radiate in addition to the antenna itself,<ref name=\"w7el\">Baluns: What They Do And How They Do It (W7EL) http://www.eznec.com/Amateur/Articles/Baluns.pdf</ref> distorting the radiation pattern and changing the impedance seen by the line. The dipole can be properly fed, and retain its expected characteristics, by using a  [[balun]] in between the coaxial feedline and the antenna terminals. Connection of coax to a dipole antenna using a balun is described in greater detail [[#Feeding a dipole using a balun|below]].\n\nAnother solution, especially for receiving antennas, is to use common 300 \u03a9 [[twin lead]] in conjunction with a ''folded dipole''. The [[folded dipole]] is similar to the simple half-wave dipole but with the feedpoint impedance multiplied by 4, thus closely matching that 300 \u03a9 impedance.<ref>Practical Wire Antennas 2 (I. Poole, G3YWX)</ref> This is the most common household antenna for fixed FM broadcast band tuners, which usually include balanced 300 \u03a9 antenna input terminals.\n\n==Dipole types==\n\n===Short dipole===\n[[Image:short-dipole.svg|left|Diagram of a short dipole antenna.]] \n\nA short dipole is a dipole formed by two conductors with a total length ''L'' substantially less than a half wavelength (\u03bb/2), the minimum length at which the antenna is resonant at the operating frequency.  In order to make the antenna resonant to feed it efficiently a [[loading coil]] is required to cancel the antenna's [[capacitive reactance]].   Short dipoles are used in applications where a full half-wave dipole would be too long and cumbersome.  As the length is reduced, the quantitative statements below become exact.\n\nThe feedpoint is usually at the center of the dipole. The current profile in each element, actually the tail end of a sinusoidal standing wave,  is approximately a triangular distribution declining from the feedpoint current to zero at the ends. The far field electric field pattern at a distance ''r'' in the direction ''\u03b8'' from the antenna's axis, is in the \u03b8 direction (transverse to the wave direction, in the plane of the antenna) of magnitude:\n\n:<math>E_\\theta={-iI_0\\sin\\theta\\over 4\\varepsilon_0 c r}{L\\over\\lambda}e^{i\\left(\\omega t-kr\\right)}.</math>\nwhere \u03c9 is the radian frequency (\u03c9=2\u03c0''f'') and ''k'' is the wavenumber (''k''=2\u03c0/\u03bb). ''c'' is the speed of light, and the feedpoint current is assumed to be <math>I_0 e^{i \\omega t}</math>.\n\n[[File:L-over2-rad-pat.svg|right|thumb|Radiation pattern of the  short dipole (dashed line) compared to the half-wave dipole (solid line).]] \nThis radiation pattern is similar to and only slightly less directional than that of the half-wave dipole.\n\n{{anchor|findRrad}}\nUsing the above expression for the radiation in the far field for a given feedpoint current, we can integrate over all [[solid angle]] to obtain the total radiated power.\n:<math>P_\\text{total}={\\pi\\over 12}I_0^2 Z_0 \\left({L\\over\\lambda}\\right)^2  </math>\nwhere ''Z''<sub>0</sub> is the [[impedance of free space]],  ''Z''<sub>0</sub> = 1/(c\u03b5<sub>0</sub>).\nFrom that, it is possible to infer the [[radiation resistance]], equal to the resistive (real) part of the feedpoint impedance, neglecting a component due to ohmic losses. By setting ''P''<sub>total</sub> to the power supplied at the feedpoint  <math>\\frac{1}{2} I_0^2 R_{radiation} </math>  (since ''I''<sub>0</sub> is the ''peak'' current) we find:\n\n:<math>R_\\text{radiation}={\\pi\\over6}Z_0 \\left({L\\over\\lambda}\\right)^2 \\approx \\left({L\\over\\lambda}\\right)^2 (197\\Omega).</math>\nAgain, these relationships are accurate for L<< \u03bb/2. Setting L=\u03bb/2 regardless, this formula would predict a radiation resistance of 49\u03a9, rather than the actual 73\u03a9 value applying to the half-wave dipole.\n\n===Half-wave dipole{{anchor|Half-wave antenna}}===\nA half-wave dipole antenna consists of two quarter-wavelength conductors placed end to end for a total length of approximately ''L''&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u03bb/2.\n\n[[File:lambdaover2-antenna.svg|right|thumb|The magnitude of current in a standing wave along the dipole]]\n\n[[File:Dipole antenna resonant frequency.webm|thumb|frame|right|400px|The Electric field intensity of a dipole antenna at its resonant frequency.]]\n\nThe current distribution is that of a [[standing wave]], approximately sinusoidal along the length of the dipole, with a node at each end and an antinode (peak current) at the center (feedpoint):<ref name=\"silver_halfwave\">{{cite book|last=Silver|first=Samuel|title=Microwave Antenna Theory and Design|year=1984|pages=98&ndash;99}}</ref>\n:<math> I(z) = I_0 e^{i\\omega t} \\cos kz,</math>\nwhere ''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2\u03c0/\u03bb and ''z'' runs from &minus;''L''&#x202f;/2 to ''L''&#x202f;/2.\n\nIn the far field, this produces a radiation pattern whose electric field is given by<ref name=\"silver_halfwave\" />\n:<math>E_\\theta = \\frac{-i Z_0 I_0}{2\\pi r} \\frac{\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\cos\\theta\\right)}{\\sin\\theta} e^{i(\\omega t - kr)}.</math>\nThe directional factor cos[(''\u03c0''/2)cos&thinsp;''\u03b8'']/sin&thinsp;''\u03b8'' is barely different from sin&thinsp;''\u03b8'' applying to the short dipole, resulting in a very similar radiation pattern as noted above.<ref name=\"silver_halfwave\" />\n\nA numerical integration of this integral over all solid angle, as we did for the short dipole, supplies a value for the radiation resistance:\n<math>R_{radiation} \\approx 73.1 \\ \\Omega.</math>\nUsing the induced EMF method, the real part of the driving point impedance can also be written in terms of the cosine integral:\n\n<math>R_{radiation} =  \\frac{Z_0}{4 \\pi} \\operatorname{Cin}(2\\pi) =   \\frac{Z_0}{4 \\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{ 1-\\cos(\\theta)}{\\theta} d \\theta  \\approx 73.1 \\ \\Omega.</math>\n\nIf the dipole is not driven at the center, then the feed point resistance will be higher.

It is formed by a conductor <math>\\scriptstyle{{\\lambda\\over 4}}</math> in length, fed in the lower end, which is near a conductive surface which works as a reflector (see [[Antenna (radio)#Effect of ground|effect of ground]]) and is an example of a Marconi antenna. The current in the reflected image has the same direction and phase as the current in the real antenna. The quarter-wave conductor and its image together form a half-wave dipole that radiates only in the upper half of space.\n\nIn this upper side of space, the emitted field has the same amplitude of the field radiated by a half-wave dipole fed with the same current. Therefore, the total emitted power is half the emitted power of a half-wave dipole fed with the same current. As the current is the same, the radiation resistance (real part of series impedance) will be half of the series impedance of a half-wave dipole. As the reactive part is also divided by 2, the impedance of a quarter-wave antenna is <math>\\scriptstyle{{73+i43\\over 2}=36+i21}</math> ohms. Since the fields above ground are the same as for the dipole, but only half the power is applied, the gain is twice (3&nbsp;dB over) that of a half-wave dipole (<math>\\scriptstyle{{\\lambda\\over 2}}</math>), that is, 5.14 dBi.\n\nThe earth can be used as ground plane, but it is a poor conductor. The reflected antenna image is only clear at glancing angles (far from the antenna). At these glancing angles, electromagnetic fields and radiation patterns are the same as for a half-wave dipole. Naturally, the impedance of the earth is far inferior to that of a good conductor ground plane. This can be improved (at cost) by laying a copper mesh.\n\nWhen the ground is not available (such as in a vehicle) other metallic surfaces can serve as a ground plane (typically the vehicle's roof). Alternatively, radial wires placed at the base of the antenna can form a ground plane. For VHF and UHF bands, the radiating and ground plane elements can be constructed from rigid rods or tubes. For a simple 1/4-wave whip, the radials are often sloped at a 45 degree angle to bring the feed point impedance closer to 50 ohms. Since this will introduce RF energy on the shield of the unbalanced feed line which deforms the radiation pattern of the antenna, a choke is often placed near the feed point.\n\n===Folded dipole===\n[[File:Folded dipole.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Folded dipole antenna]]\nA folded dipole is a half-wave dipole with an additional wire connecting its two ends. If the additional wire has the same diameter and cross-section as the dipole, two nearly identical radiating currents are generated. The resulting far-field emission pattern is nearly identical to the one for the single-wire dipole described above, but at resonance its feedpoint impedance <math>R_{fd}</math> is four times the radiation resistance of a single-wire dipole. This is because for a fixed amount of power, the total radiating current <math>I_0</math> is equal to twice the current in each wire and thus equal to twice the current at the feed point. Equating the average radiated power to the average power delivered at the feedpoint, we may write\n\n:<math> \\frac{1}{2} R_{\\frac{\\lambda}{2}} I_0^2 = \\frac{1}{2} R_{fd}\\left( I_0/2 \\right)^2. </math>\n\nIt follows that\n\n:<math> R_{fd}= 4 R_{\\frac{\\lambda}{2}} \\approx 292.32\\ \\Omega .</math>\n\nThe folded dipole is therefore well matched to 300-ohm balanced transmission lines.  The folded dipole has a wider bandwidth than a single dipole.  They can be used for transforming the value of input impedance of the dipole over a broad range of step-up ratios by changing the thicknesses of the wire conductors for the fed- and folded-sides.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Yasuto |last=Mushiake |title=An Exact Impedance Step-Up Impedance-Ratio Chart of a Folded Antenna |journal=IRE.

The [[T2FD]] antenna is a folded dipole.  They are also widely used as [[driven element]]s for rooftop [[Yagi-Uda antenna|Yagi]] [[television antenna]]s.\n\n[[File:AmateurRadioAntenna2.JPG|thumb|right|upright|A self-made dipole antenna with mast]]\n\n===Other dipole antenna types===\nThere are numerous notable variations of dipole antennas:\n*The ''bow-tie antenna'' is a dipole with flaring, triangular shaped arms.  The shape gives it a much wider bandwidth than an ordinary dipole.  It is widely used in UHF [[television antenna]]s.\n*The ''vee'' or ''quadrant'' antenna is a horizontal dipole with its arms at an angle instead of parallel.  Quadrant antennas are notable in that they can be used to make [[horizontal polarization|horizontally polarized]] antennas with near-[[omnidirectional antenna|omnidirectional]] radiation patterns.  They are used for [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmitting]] on the HF band.\n*The [[G5RV Antenna]] is a dipole antenna with a symmetric feeder line, which also serves as a 1:1 impedance transformer allowing the transceiver to see the impedance of the antenna (it does not match the antenna to the 50-ohm transceiver. In fact the impedance will be somewhere around 90 ohms at the resonant frequency but significantly different at other frequencies).\n*The [[sloper antenna]] is a slanted dipole antenna used for long-range communications or in limited space.\n*The [[Near Vertical Incidence Skywave#The AS-2259 Antenna|AS-2259 Antenna]] is an inverted-V dipole antenna used for [[Near Vertical Incidence Skywave|NVIS]] communications.\n\n==Common applications==\n\n===\"Rabbit ears\" TV antenna=== \n[[File:Rabbit-ears dipole antenna with UHF loop 20090204.jpg|thumb|200px|\"Rabbit-ears\" VHF [[television antenna]] (the small loop is a separate UHF antenna).]]\nOne of the most common applications of the dipole antenna is the ''rabbit ears'' or ''bunny ears'' [[television antenna]], found atop broadcast [[television receiver]]s.  It is used to receive the VHF terrestrial television bands, consisting in the US of 52 to 88&nbsp;MHz ([[band I]]) and 174 to 216&nbsp;MHz ([[band III]]), with wavelengths of 5.5 to 1.4 m.  Since this frequency range is much wider than a single fixed dipole antenna can cover, it is made with several degrees of adjustment.   It is constructed of two telescoping rods that can be extended out to about 1 m length (approximately one quarter wavelength at 52&nbsp;MHz).  Instead of being fixed in opposing directions, these elements can be adjusted at an angle in a \"V\" shape.  The reason for the V shape is that when receiving channels at the top of the band, the antenna elements will typically resonate at their 3rd [[harmonic (music)|harmonic]].  In this mode the direction of maximum gain is no longer perpendicular to the rods, but the radiation pattern will have lobes at an angle to the rods, making it advantageous to be able to adjust them to various angles.\n\n===FM broadcast receiving antennas===\nIn contrast to the wide television frequency bands, the FM broadcast band (88-108&nbsp;MHz) is narrow enough that a dipole antenna can cover it.  For fixed use in homes, [[hi-fi]] tuners are typically supplied with simple folded dipoles resonant near the center of that band.  The feedpoint impedance of a folded dipole, which is quadruple the impedance of a simple dipole, is a good match for 300\u03a9 [[twin lead]], so that is usually used for the transmission line to the tuner.  A common construction is to make the arms of the folded dipole out of twin lead also, shorted at their ends.  This flexible antenna can be conveniently taped or nailed to walls, following the contours of mouldings.\n\n===Shortwave antenna===\nHorizontal wire dipole antennas are popular for use on the [[high frequency|HF]] [[shortwave band]]s, both for transmitting and [[shortwave listening]].  They are usually constructed of two lengths of wire joined by a [[strain insulator]] in the center, which is the feedpoint. The ends can be attached to existing buildings, structures, or trees, taking advantage of their heights. If used for transmitting, it is essential that the ends of the antenna be attached to supports through strain insulators with a sufficiently high [[electric arc|flashover voltage]], since the antenna's high voltage [[antinode]]s occur there. Being a balanced antenna, they are best fed with a [[balun]] between the (coax) transmission line and the feedpoint.\n\nThese are simple to put up for temporary or field use. But they are also widely used by [[radio amateur]]s and short wave listeners in fixed locations due to their simple (and inexpensive) construction, while still realizing a resonant antenna at frequencies where resonant antenna elements need to be of quite some size. They are an attractive solution for these frequencies when significant directionality is not desired, and the cost of several such resonant antennas for different frequency bands, built at home, may still be much less than a single commercially produced antenna.\n\n===Dipole towers===\nAlthough the [[mast radiator]] antenna towers for MF and LF transmission are usually constructed as [[monopole antenna|monopoles]], some are dipoles.  The metal structure of the mast is divided in half{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}, and is driven in the center.\n\n===Dipole arrays===\n[[File:Collinear folded dipole antenna array.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Collinear folded dipole array]]\n\nMany types of [[Antenna array (electromagnetic)|array antennas]] are constructed using multiple dipoles, usually half-wave dipoles.   The purpose of using multiple dipoles is to increase the directional [[antenna gain|gain]] of the antenna over the gain of a single dipole; the radiation of the separate dipoles [[interference (wave propagation)|interferes]] to enhance power radiated in desired directions.  In arrays with multiple dipole [[driven element]]s, the [[feed line|feedline]] is split using an electrical network in order to provide power to the elements, with careful attention paid to the relative phase delays due to transmission between the common point and each element.\n\nFor a vertically oriented dipole, which has an omnidirectional radiation pattern in the horizontal plane, it is possible to stack dipoles end-to-end fed in phase, creating a [[collinear antenna array]].  The array still has an omnidirectional pattern, but more power is radiated in the desired horizontal directions and less at large angles up into the sky or down toward the Earth.   Collinear arrays are used in the VHF and UHF frequency bands at which the size of the dipoles are small enough so several can be stacked on a mast.   They are a practical and higher-gain alternative to quarter wave [[Whip antenna|ground plane antennas]] used in fixed base stations for mobile [[two-way radio]]s, such as police, fire, and taxi dispatchers.\n\n[[File:SCR-270 Radar Antenna2.jpg|thumb|A [[reflective array antenna]] for radar consisting of numerous dipoles fed in-phase (thus realizing a ''broadside array'') in front of a large reflector (horizontal wires) to make it uni-directional.]]\nOn the other hand, an array of dipoles can be used to realize substantial directivity in a particular horizontal direction. In a ''broadside array'' the dipoles can again be arranged colinear (end to end), or side by side, or both. The antennas are then fed in the same phase. This creates greater gain in the direction perpendicular to the antennas, at the expense of most other directions. Unfortunately that also means that the direction ''opposite'' the desired direction also has a high gain, whereas high gain is usually desired in one single direction. The power which is wasted in the reverse direction, however, can be recovered using a large planer reflector, as is accomplished in the [[reflective array antenna]], increasing the gain in the desired direction by another 3&nbsp;dB\n\nThis large reflector can be avoided in the ''end-fire array''. In this case the dipoles are again side by side, but are fed in different phases. Rather than being directive perpendicular to the line connecting their feedpoints, now the directivity is ''along'' the line connecting their feedpoints. By using an appropriate spacing and phasing, the radiation can be directed in a single direction along that line, with radiation mainly cancelled in the reverse direction as well as most other directions.\n\n===Yagi antennas===\n{{main|Yagi-Uda antenna}}\nThe above described array antennas with multiple [[driven element]]s require a complex feed system of signal splitting, phasing, distribution to the elements, and impedance matching.  A different sort of end-fire array which is much more often used is based on the use of so-called ''[[parasitic element]]s''. In the popular high-gain [[Yagi antenna]], only one of the dipoles is actually connected electrically, but the others receive and reradiate power supplied by the driven element. This time, the phasing is accomplished by careful choice of the lengths as well as positions of the parasitic elements, in order to concentrate gain in one direction and largely cancel radiation in the opposite direction (as well as all other directions). Although the realized gain is less than a driven array with the same number of elements, the simplicity of the electrical connections makes the Yagi more practical for consumer applications.\n\n==Hertzian dipole==\n[[Image:elementary-doublet.jpg|right|thumb|Hertzian dipole of tiny length \u03b4\u2113, with current ''I'', and field sensed at a distance ''r'' in the \u03b8 direction.]]\nThe ''Hertzian dipole'' or ''Elementary doublet'' refers to a theoretical construction, rather than a physical antenna design. It may be defined as a finite oscillating current (in a specified direction) of <math>I e^{i\\omega t}</math> over a tiny or [[infinitesimal]] length \u03b4\u2113 at a specified position. The solution of the fields from a Hertzian dipole can be used as the basis for analytical or numerical calculation of the radiation from more complex antenna geometries (such as practical dipoles) by forming the [[Superposition principle|superposition]] of fields from a large number of Hertzian dipoles comprising the current pattern of the actual antenna. As a function of position, taking the elementary current elements multiplied by infinitesimal lengths  ''I''('''r''')d\u2113, the resulting field pattern then reduces to an [[integral]] over the path of an antenna conductor (modelled as a thin wire).\n\nFor the following derivation we shall take the current to be in the ''Z'' direction centered at the origin (''x''=''y''=''z''=0), with the sinusoidal time dependence <math>e^{i\\omega t}</math> for all quantities being understood. The simplest approach is to use the calculation of the [[vector potential]] '''A'''('''r''') using the formula for the [[Retarded potential#Retarded and advanced potentials for time-dependent fields|retarded potential]]. Although the value of '''A''' is not unique, we shall constrain it according to the [[Lorenz gauge]], and assuming sinusoidal current at radian frequency \u03c9 the retardation of the field is converted just into a phase factor <math>e^{-i k r}</math>, where the wavenumber ''k'' = \u03c9/''c'' in free space and ''r'' is the distance between the point being considered to the origin (where we assumed the current source to be), thus ''r'' = |'''r'''|.

As seen in the accompanying animation, the '''E''' and '''H''' fields very close to the source are almost 90\u00b0 out of phase, thus contributing very little to the [[Poynting vector]] by which radiated flux is computed. The near field solution for an antenna element (from the integral using this formula over the length of that element) is the field that can be used to compute the [[Antenna (radio)#Mutual impedance and interaction between antennas|mutual impedance]] between it and another nearby element.\n\nFor computation of the [[far field]] radiation pattern, the above equations are simplified as only the 1/''r'' terms remain significant:<ref name=\"silver92\" />\n\n:<math>H_\\phi= i \\frac{I\\delta \\ell\\, k}{4\\pi r} e^{-ikr}\\,\\sin(\\theta)</math>\n\n:<math>E_\\theta= i\\frac{Z_0 \\,I \\delta \\ell\\, k}{4\\pi r} e^{-ikr}\\,\\sin(\\theta) \\;</math>.\n\n[[File:Felder um Dipol.svg|thumb|Electric field lines ''(<span style=\"color:blue;\">blue</span>)'' and magnetic field components ''(<span style=\"color:red;\">red</span>)'' at right angles composing the [[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic wave]] radiated by the current element (black).]] \nThe far field pattern is thus seen to consist of a transverse electromagnetic (TEM) wave, with electric and magnetic fields at right angles to each other and at right angles to the direction of propagation (the direction of '''r''', as we assumed the source to be at the origin). The electric polarization, in the \u03b8 direction, is coplanar with the source current (in the ''Z'' direction), while the magnetic field is at right angles to that, in the \u03c6 direction. It can be seen from these equations, and also in the animation, that the fields at these distances are exactly ''in phase''. Both fields fall according to 1/''r'', with the power thus falling according to 1/''r''<sup>2</sup> as dictated by the [[inverse square law]].\n\n===Radiation resistance===\nIf one knows the far field radiation pattern due to a given antenna current, then it is possible to compute the [[radiation resistance]] directly. For the above fields due to the Hertzian dipole, we can compute the power flux according to the [[Poynting vector]], resulting in a power (as averaged over one cycle) of: \n:<math>\\langle\\mathbf{S}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{Re}\\left(\\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{H}^*\\right).</math>\n\nAlthough not required, it is simplest to do the following exercise at a large ''r'' where the  far field expressions for '''E''' and '''H''' apply. Consider a large sphere surrounding the source with a radius ''r''. We find the power per unit area crossing the surface of that sphere to be in the <math> \\hat\\mathbf{r}</math> direction according to :\n:<math>\\langle\\mathbf{S}_\\mathsf{r}\\rangle = \\frac{Z_0}{2} \n\\frac{k^2 |I|^2\\ (\\delta \\ell)^2}{(4\\pi r)^2}  \\sin^2\\theta </math>\n\nIntegration of this flux over the complete sphere results in:\n\n:<math>P_{net} = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\! \\! \\int_0^{\\pi} \\langle\\mathbf{S}_\\mathsf{r}\\rangle  r^2 \\sin\\theta \\, d\\phi \\, d\\theta  </math>\n\n:<math>\\; \\; =\\frac{Z_0}{12 \\pi} k^2 |I|^2\\ (\\delta \\ell)^2 =\n\\frac{ \\pi  Z_0}{3}  |I|^2\\ \\left( \\frac{\\delta \\ell}{\\lambda} \\right)^2 </math>\nwhere <math>\\lambda = 2\\pi / k</math> is the free space wavelength corresponding to the radian frequency \u03c9. By definition, the radiation resistance ''R''<sub>rad</sub> times the average of the square of the current |''I''|<sup>2</sup>/2 is the net power radiated due to that current, so equating the above to  |''I''|<sup>2</sup>''R''<sub>rad</sub>/2 we find:\n\n:<math>R_\\mathrm{rad} = \\frac{2 \\pi}{3} Z_{0} \\left( \\frac{\\delta\\ell}{\\lambda}\\right)^{2}.</math>\n\nThis method can be used to compute the radiation resistance for any antenna whose far field radiation pattern has been found in terms of a specific antenna current. If ohmic losses in the conductors are neglected, the radiation resistance (considered relative to the feedpoint) is identical to the resistive (real) component of the feedpoint impedance. Unfortunately this exercise tells us nothing about the reactive (imaginary) component of feedpoint impedance, whose calculation is considered [[#Detailed calculation of dipole feedpoint impedance|below]].\n\n===Directive gain===\nUsing the above expression for the radiated flux given by the Poynting vector, it is also possible to compute the directive gain of the Hertzian dipole. Dividing the total power computed above by 4\u03c0''r''<sup>2</sup> we can find the flux averaged over all directions ''P''<sub>avg</sub> as\n\n:<math>P_{avg} = \\frac{P_{net}}{4\\pi r^2} = \n\\frac{Z_0}{48 \\pi^2 r^2} k^2 |I|^2\\ (\\delta \\ell)^2 </math>.\n\nDividing the flux radiated in a ''particular'' direction by  ''P''<sub>avg</sub> we obtain the [[directive gain]] ''G''(\u03b8):\n\n:<math>\\mathsf{G}(\\theta) = \\frac{\\langle\\mathbf{S}_\\mathsf{r}\\rangle}{P_{avg}} \n= \\frac{3}{2} \\sin^2\\theta</math>. \nThe commonly quoted antenna \"gain\", meaning the peak value of the gain pattern (radiation pattern), is found to be 1.5 or 1.76 dBi, lower than practically any other antenna configuration.\n\n===Comparison with the short dipole===\nThe Hertzian dipole is ''similar to'' but differs from the short dipole, discussed above. In both cases the conductor is very short compared to a wavelength, so the standing wave pattern present on a half wave dipole (for instance) is absent. However, with the Hertzian dipole we specified that the current along that conductor is ''constant'' over its short length. This makes the Hertzian dipole useful for analysis of more complex antenna configurations, where every infinitesimal section of that ''real'' antenna's conductor can be modelled as a Hertzian dipole with the current found to be flowing in that real antenna.\n\nHowever a short conductor fed with a RF voltage will ''not'' have a uniform current even along that short range. Rather, a short dipole in real life has a current equal to the feedpoint current at the feedpoint but falling linearly to zero over the length of that short conductor. By placing a ''capacitive hat'', such as a metallic ball, at the end of the conductor, it is possible for its [[self capacitance]] to absorb the current from the conductor and better approximate the constant current assumed for the Hertzian dipole. But again, the Hertzian dipole is meant only as a theoretical construct for antenna analysis.\n\nThe short dipole, with a feedpoint current of ''I''<sub>0</sub>, has an ''average'' current over each conductor of only ''I''<sub>0</sub>/2. The above field equations for the Hertzian dipole of length \u03b4\u2113 would then predict the ''actual'' fields for a short dipole using that effective current ''I'' = ''I''<sub>0</sub>/2. This would result in a power measured in the far field of ''one quarter'' that given by the above equation for the Poynting vector <math>\\langle\\mathbf{S}_\\mathsf{r}\\rangle</math> if we had assumed an element current of ''I''<sub>0</sub>. Consequently, it can be seen that the radiation resistance computed for the short dipole is one quarter of that computed above for the Hertzian dipole. But their radiation patterns (and gains) are identical.\n\n==Detailed calculation of dipole feedpoint impedance==\nThe impedance seen at the feedpoint of a dipole of various lengths has been plotted above, in terms of the real (resistive) component ''R''<sub>dipole</sub> and the imaginary ([[Electrical reactance|reactive]]) component ''jX''<sub>dipole</sub> of that impedance. For the case of an antenna with perfect conductors (no ohmic loss), ''R''<sub>dipole</sub> is identical to the [[radiation resistance]], which can more easily be computed from the total power in the far-field radiation pattern for a given applied current [[#findRrad|as we showed]] for the short dipole. The calculation of ''X''<sub>dipole</sub> is more difficult.\n\n===Induced EMF method===\n{{anchor|inducedEMF}}\nUsing the ''induced EMF method'' closed form expressions are obtained for both components of the feedpoint impedance; such results are plotted [[#Impedance of dipoles of various lengths|above]]. The solution depends on an assumption for the form of the current distribution along the antenna conductors. For wavelength to element diameter ratios greater than about 60, the current distribution along each antenna element is very well approximated <ref name=\"kai\" /> as a sine wave along each conductor:\n:<math> I(z) = A \\sin(k (L/2 - |z|)) </math>\nwhere ''L'' is the full length of the dipole, ''z'' is the position along the dipole relative to the feedpoint, ''k'' is the [[wavenumber]] equal to 2\u03c0/\u03bb (\u03bb being the wavelength, \u03bb=''c/f'' for an antenna in free space), and ''A'' is an amplitude chosen to match an assumed driving point current by setting ''z''=0.\n\nIn cases where an approximately sinusoidal current distribution can be assumed, this method solves for the driving point impedance in closed form using the [[trigonometric integral|cosine and sine integral functions]] Si(x) and Ci(x). For a dipole of total length ''L'' using conductors with a radius ''a'' operating at a frequency with wavenumber ''k'' (''k'' = 2\u03c0''f''/c in free space) in a medium with characteristic impedance ''Z''<sub>m</sub> (usually [[Impedance of free space|Z<sub>0</sub>]] with the antenna in free space), then the resistance ''R'' and reactance ''X'' of the driving point impedance can be expressed as:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nR_\\mathrm{dipole} &= \\frac{Z_m}{2 \\pi \\sin^2(kL/2)} \\Big\\{\n  \\gamma + \\ln(kL) - \\operatorname{Ci}(kL) + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\sin(kL) \\big[\\operatorname{Si}(2kL)- 2\\operatorname{Si}(kL)\\big] \\\\\n &\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\cos(kL)\\big[ \\gamma + \\ln(kL/2) + \\operatorname{Ci}(2kL) - 2\\operatorname{Ci}(kL) \\big]\n\\Big\\}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nX_\\mathrm{dipole} &= \\frac{Z_m}{ 4 \\pi \\sin^2(kL/2)} \\Big\\{\n  2 \\operatorname{Si}(kL) + \\cos(kL)\\big[ 2 \\operatorname{Si}(kL) - \\operatorname{Si}(2kL) \\big] \\\\\n &\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad - \\sin(kL)\\big[ 2 \\operatorname{Ci}(kL) - \\operatorname{Ci}(2kL) - \\operatorname{Ci}(2ka^2/L) \\big]\n\\Big\\},\n\\end{align}</math>\nwhere ''\u03b3'' is the [[Euler constant]].<ref>Chaotic behavior in receiver front-end limiters, F Caudron & A Ouslimani, Progress in Electromagnetics Research Letters, Vol 23 19-28 2011, pp 23-24</ref>\n\nThis computation using the induced EMF method is identical to the computation of the [[Antenna (radio)#Mutual impedance and interaction between antennas|mutual impedance]] between two dipoles (with infinitesimal conductor radius) separated by the distance ''a''. Because the field at or beyond the edge of an antenna's cylindrical conductor at a distance ''a'' is only dependent on the current distribution along the conductor, and not the radius of the conductor, that field is used to compute the mutual impedance between that filamentary antenna and the ''actual'' position of the conductor with a radius ''a''. This then supplies the self-impedance of the conductor itself.\n\n===Integral methods===\nNote that the induced EMF method is dependent on the assumption of a sinusoidal current distribution, delivering an accuracy better than about 10% as long as the wavelength to element diameter ratio is greater than about 60.<ref name=\"kai\" /> However, for yet larger conductors numerical solutions are required which solve for the conductor's current distribution (rather than ''assuming'' a sinusoidal pattern). This can be based on approximating solutions for either ''Pocklington's integrodifferential equation'' or the ''Hall\u00e9n integral equation''.<ref name=\"Balanis\" /> These approaches also have greater generality, not being limited to linear conductors.\n\nNumerical solution of either is performed using the ''moment method solution'' which requires expansion of that current into a set of [[basis functions]]; one simple (but not the best) choice, for instance, is to break up the conductor into ''N'' segments with a constant current assumed along each. After setting an appropriate weighting function the cost may be minimized through the inversion of a NxN matrix. Determination of each matrix element requires at least one double integration involving the weighting functions, which may become computationally intensive. These are simplified if the weighting functions are simply [[dirac delta function|delta functions]], which corresponds to fitting the boundary conditions for the current along the conductor at only ''N'' discrete points. Then the NxN matrix must be inverted, which is also computationally intensive as ''N'' increases. In one simple example,<ref name=\"Balanis\" /> ''Balanis'' performs this computation to find the antenna impedance with different ''N'' using Pocklington's method and finds that with ''N''>60 solutions have approached their limiting values to within a few percent.\n\n==Feeding a dipole using a balun==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    = Feeding a dipole antenna with coax cable\n| width     = 150\n\n| image1    = dipolefeedrad.png\n| alt1      = Coax and antenna both acting as radiators instead of only the antenna.\n| caption1  = Coax and antenna both acting as radiators instead of only the antenna.\n\n| image2    = dipolewidebandbalun.png\n| alt2      = Dipole with a current balun.\n| caption2  = Dipole with a current balun.\n\n| image3    = Dipolehalfwavebalun.png\n| alt3      = A folded dipole (300 \u03a9) to coax (75 \u03a9) 4:1 balun.\n| caption3  = A folded dipole (300 \u03a9) to coax (75 \u03a9) 4:1 balun.\n\n| image4    = dipolesleevebalun.png\n| alt4      = Dipole using a sleeve balun.\n| caption4  = Dipole using a sleeve balun.\n\n}}\n{{clear}}\nA dipole is a symmetrical antenna, as it is composed of two symmetrical ungrounded elements. Therefore, it works best when fed by a [[Transmission line|balanced transmission line]], such as a [[ladder line]], because in that case the symmetry (one aspect of the impedance complex, which is a complex number) matches and therefore the power transfer is optimum.\n\nWhen a dipole with an unbalanced feedline such as [[coaxial cable]] is used for [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmitting]], the shield side of the cable, in addition to the antenna, radiates.<ref name=\"w7el\"/> This can induce [[radio frequency]] (RF) currents into other electronic equipment near the radiating feedline, causing RF interference. Furthermore, the antenna is not as efficient as it could be because it is radiating closer to the ground and its radiation pattern may be asymmetrically distorted. To prevent this, dipoles fed by coaxial cables have a [[balun]] between the cable and the antenna, to convert the unbalanced signal provided by the coax to a balanced symmetrical signal for the antenna.\n\nSeveral types of balun are commonly used to feed a dipole antenna: current baluns and coax baluns. Baluns can be made using ferrite toroid cores or even from the coax feedline itself.<ref>Baluns for 88\u2013108 MHz B. Beezely (K6STI) http://www.ham-radio.com/k6sti/balun.htm</ref> The choice of the toroid core is crucial. A rule of thumb is: the more power, the bigger the core.<ref>Toroid Cores for 1:4 Baluns (DG3OBK) http://www.aroesner.homepage.t-online.de/balun.html</ref>\n\n===Current balun===\nA current balun consists of two windings that are closely coupled.<ref name=\"w7el\"/><ref>A Cost Effective Current-mode 1:1 Balun (R. Holland) http://www.arising.com.au/people/Holland/Ralph/CMBalun.htm</ref>\n\n===Coax balun===\nA coax balun is a cost-effective method of eliminating feeder radiation, but is limited to a narrow set of operating frequencies.\n\nOne easy way to make a balun is to use a length of coaxial cable equal to half a wavelength. The inner core of the cable is linked at each end to one of the balanced connections for a feeder or dipole. One of these terminals should be connected to the inner core of the coaxial feeder. All three braids should be connected together. This then forms a 4:1 balun, which works correctly at only a narrow band of frequencies.\n\n===Sleeve balun===\nAt [[VHF]] frequencies, a sleeve balun can also be built to remove feeder radiation.<ref>[http://www.w8ji.com/sleeve_baluns.htm Sleeve Baluns]</ref>\n\nAnother narrow-band design is to use a ''\u03bb''/4 length of metal pipe. The coaxial cable is placed inside the pipe; at one end the braid is wired to the pipe while at the other end no connection is made to the pipe. The balanced end of this balun is at the end where no connection is made to the pipe. The ''\u03bb''/4 conductor acts as a transformer, converting the zero impedance at the short to the braid into an infinite impedance at the open end.  This infinite impedance at the open end of the pipe prevents current flowing into the outer coax formed by the outside of the inner coax shield and the pipe, forcing the current to remain in the inside coax. This balun design is impractical for low frequencies because of the long length of pipe that will be needed.\n\n==Dipole as a reference standard==\nAntenna [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] is sometimes measured as decibels relative to a half-wave dipole, which means that the antenna in question is being compared to a dipole, and has a certain amount of gain relative to a dipole antenna tuned to the same operating [[frequency]]. In this case, one says the antenna has a [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] of \"''x'' dBd\" (see [[decibel]]). More often, gains are expressed relative to an [[isotropic radiator]], which is an imaginary antenna that radiates equally in all directions. In this case one uses dBi instead of dBd (see [[decibel]]). As it is impossible to build an isotropic radiator, gain measurements expressed relative to a dipole are more practical when a reference dipole aerial is used for experimental measurements. 0 dBd is often considered equal to 2.15 dBi.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Electronic symbol]]\n*[[Isotropic antenna]]\n*[[Omnidirectional antenna]]\n*[[Whip antenna]]\n*[[Driven element]]\n*[[Balun]]\n*[[Coaxial antenna]]\n*[[Amateur radio]]\n*[[Shortwave listening]]\n*[[T-aerial]]\n*[[AM broadcasting]]\n*[[FM broadcasting]]\n*[[Dipole field strength in free space]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\nElementary, short and half-wave dipoles:\n{{refbegin|colwidth=33em}}\n*{{Citation\n  |title= Electronic Radio and Engineering\n  |first= Frederick E.\n  |last= Terman\n  |first2= Robert\n  |last2= Helliwell\n  |publisher= MacGraw-Hill\n  |year= 1955\n  |edition= 4th\n  |isbn= 978-0-07-085795-7\n  |doi= }}\n*{{Citation\n  |title=Lectures on Physics\n  |last=Feynman\n  |last2= Leighton\n  |last3= Sands\n  |publisher= Addison-Wesley\n  |volume=\n  |isbn=\n  |doi= }}\n*{{Citation\n  |title= Classical Electricity and Magnetism\n  |first= W.\n  |last= Panofsky\n  |first2= M.\n  |last2= Phillips\n  |publisher= Addison-Wesley\n  |isbn=\n  |doi= }}\n* http://www.ece.rutgers.edu/~orfanidi/ewa/ Electromagnetic Waves and Antennas, Sophocles J.
