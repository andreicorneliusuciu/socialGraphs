The current is generated when photons are absorbed in the photodiode.  A small amount of current is also produced when no light is present.   Photodiodes may contain [[optical filter]]s, built-in lenses, and may have large or small surface areas. Photodiodes usually have a slower response time as their surface area increases. The common, traditional [[solar cell]] used to generate electric [[solar power]] is a large area photodiode.\n\nPhotodiodes are similar to regular [[semiconductor]] [[diode]]s except that they may be either exposed (to detect [[vacuum UV]] or [[X-rays]]) or packaged with a window or [[optical fiber]] connection to allow light to reach the sensitive part of the device. Many diodes designed for use specifically as a photodiode use a [[PIN diode|PIN junction]] rather than a [[p\u2013n junction]], to increase the speed of response. A photodiode is designed to operate in [[reverse bias]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Cox, James F. |title=Fundamentals of linear electronics: integrated and discrete|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FbezraN9tvEC&pg=PA91|date=2001|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-7668-3018-9|pages=91\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==Principle of operation==\nA photodiode is a [[p\u2013n junction]] or [[PIN diode|PIN structure]]. When a [[photon]] of sufficient energy strikes the diode, it creates an [[electron]]-[[electron hole|hole]] pair. This mechanism is also known as the inner [[photoelectric effect]]. If the absorption occurs in the junction's [[depletion region]], or one diffusion length away from it, these carriers are swept from the junction by the built-in electric field of the depletion region. Thus holes move toward the [[anode]], and electrons toward the [[cathode]], and a [[photocurrent]] is produced. The total current through the photodiode is the sum of the dark current (current that is generated in the absence of light) and the photocurrent, so the dark current must be minimized to maximize the sensitivity of the device.<ref>Tavernier, Filip  and Steyaert, Michiel (2011) ''High-Speed Optical Receivers with Integrated Photodiode in Nanoscale CMOS''. Springer. ISBN 1-4419-9924-8. Chapter 3 ''From Light to Electric Current \u2013 The Photodiode''</ref>\n\n===Photovoltaic mode===\nWhen used in zero [[bias (electrical engineering)|bias]] or ''photovoltaic mode'', the flow of photocurrent out of the device is restricted and a voltage builds up. This mode exploits the [[photovoltaic effect]], which is the basis for [[solar cell]]s \u2013 a traditional solar cell is just a large area photodiode.\n\n===Photoconductive mode===\n\nIn this mode the diode is often [[p\u2013n junction#Reverse bias|reverse biased]] (with the cathode driven positive with respect to the anode).  This reduces the response time because the additional reverse bias increases the width of the depletion layer, which decreases the junction's [[capacitance]]. The reverse bias also increases the [[Dark current (physics)|dark current]] without much change in the photocurrent. For a given spectral distribution, the photocurrent is linearly proportional to the [[illuminance]] (and to the [[irradiance]]).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Electronic/photdet.html| title = Photodiode slide|work=hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu}}</ref>\n\nAlthough this mode is faster, the photoconductive mode tends to exhibit more electronic noise.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.pacer.co.uk/Assets/Pacer/User/Photodiodes.pdf | title = Photodiode Application Notes \u2013 Excelitas \u2013 see note 4 }}</ref> The leakage current of a good PIN diode is so low (&lt;1 nA) that the [[Johnson\u2013Nyquist noise]] of the load resistance in a typical circuit often dominates.\n\n===Other modes of operation===\n\n'''[[Avalanche photodiode]]s''' are photodiodes with structure optimized for operating with high reverse bias, approaching the reverse breakdown voltage. This allows each ''photo-generated'' carrier to be multiplied by [[avalanche breakdown]], resulting in internal gain within the photodiode, which increases the effective ''responsivity'' of the device.\n[[File:PhototransistorSymbol.png|100px|thumb|Electronic symbol for a phototransistor]]\nA '''phototransistor''' is a light-sensitive transistor. A common type of phototransistor, called a photobipolar transistor, is in essence a [[bipolar transistor]] encased in a transparent case so that [[light]] can reach the ''base\u2013collector [[p\u2013n junction|junction]]''. It was invented by Dr. [[John N. Shive]] (more famous for his [[Shive wave machine|wave machine]]) at Bell Labs in 1948,<ref name=\"crystal-fire\">{{cite book |year=1998\n | title = Crystal Fire: The Invention of the Transistor and the Birth of the Information Age\n | isbn = 9780393318517\n | author = Riordan, Michael and Hoddeson, Lillian \n}}</ref>{{rp|205}} but it was not announced until 1950.<ref>{{cite journal\n | url = http://www.smecc.org/phototransistor.htm\n | title = The phototransistor\n | date = May 1950 \n | journal = Bell Laboratories RECORD\n}}</ref> The electrons that are generated by photons in the base\u2013collector junction are injected into the base, and this photodiode current is amplified by the transistor's current gain \u03b2 (or h<sub>fe</sub>). If the base and collector leads are used and the emitter is left unconnected, the phototransistor becomes a photodiode. While phototransistors have a higher [[responsivity]] for light they are not able to detect low levels of light any better than photodiodes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Phototransistors also have significantly longer response times. Field-effect phototransistors, also known as photoFETs, are light-sensitive field-effect transistors. Unlike photobipolar transistors, photoFETs control drain-source current by creating a gate voltage.\n\n==Materials==\nThe material used to make a photodiode is critical to defining its properties, because only [[photon]]s with sufficient energy to excite [[electron]]s across the material's [[bandgap]] will produce significant photocurrents.\n\nMaterials commonly used to produce photodiodes include:<ref>Held.

The wavelength-dependence may also be expressed as a ''[[Quantum efficiency]]'', or the ratio of the number of photogenerated carriers to incident photons, a unitless quantity.\n\n;[[Dark current (physics)|Dark current]]: The current through the photodiode in the absence of light, when it is operated in photoconductive mode. The dark current includes photocurrent generated by background radiation and the saturation current of the semiconductor junction. Dark current must be accounted for by [[calibration]] if a photodiode is used to make an accurate optical power measurement, and it is also a source of [[Electronic noise|noise]] when a photodiode is used in an optical communication system.\n\n;[[Response time (technology)|Response time]]: A photon absorbed by the semiconducting material will generate an electron-hole pair which will in turn start moving in the material under the effect of the electric field and thus generate a [[Electric current|current]]. The finite duration of this current is known as the transit-time spread and can be evaluated by using [[Shockley\u2013Ramo theorem|Ramo's theorem]]. One can also show with this theorem that the total charge generated in the external circuit is well [[Elementary charge|e]] and not 2e as might seem by the presence of the two carriers. Indeed, the [[integral]] of the current due to both electron and hole over time must be equal to e. The resistance and capacitance of the photodiode and the external circuitry give rise to another response time known as [[RC time constant]] <math>\\tau=RC</math>. This combination of R and C integrates the photoresponse over time and thus lengthens the [[impulse response]] of the photodiode. When used in an optical communication system, the response time determines the bandwidth available for signal modulation and thus data transmission.\n\n;[[Noise-equivalent power]]: (NEP) The minimum input optical power to generate photocurrent, equal to the rms noise current in a 1&nbsp;[[hertz]] bandwidth.  NEP is essentially the minimum detectable power. The related characteristic detectivity (<math>D</math>) is the inverse of NEP, 1/NEP. There is also the [[specific detectivity]] (<math>D^\\star</math>) which is the detectivity multiplied by the square root of the area (<math>A</math>) of the photodetector, (<math>D^\\star=D\\sqrt{A}</math>) for a 1&nbsp;Hz bandwidth.  The specific detectivity allows different systems to be compared independent of sensor area and system bandwidth; a higher detectivity value indicates a low-noise device or system.<ref>Brooker, Graham (2009) ''Introduction to Sensors for Ranging and Imaging'', ScitTech Publishing. p. 87. ISBN 9781891121746</ref> Although it is traditional to give (<math>D^\\star</math>) in many catalogues as a measure of the diode's quality, in practice, it is hardly ever the key parameter.\n\nWhen a photodiode is used in an optical communication system, all these parameters contribute to the ''[[sensitivity (electronics)|sensitivity]]'' of the optical receiver, which is the minimum input power required for the receiver to achieve a specified ''[[bit error rate]]''.\n\n==Applications==\nP\u2013n photodiodes are used in similar applications to other [[photodetector]]s, such as [[photoconductor]]s, [[charge-coupled device]]s, and [[photomultiplier]] tubes. They may be used to generate an output which is dependent upon the illumination (analog; for measurement and the like), or to change the state of circuitry (digital; either for control and switching, or digital signal processing).\n\nPhotodiodes are used in [[consumer electronics]] devices such as [[compact disc]] players, [[smoke detector]]s, and the receivers for infrared [[Remote control|remote control devices]] used to control equipment from [[television]]s to air conditioners. For many applications either photodiodes or photoconductors may be used. Either type of photosensor may be used for light measurement, as in [[camera]] light meters, or to respond to light levels, as in switching on street lighting after dark.\n\nPhotosensors of all types may be used to respond to incident light, or to a source of light which is part of the same circuit or system. A photodiode is often combined into a single component with an emitter of light, usually a [[light-emitting diode]] (LED), either to detect the presence of a mechanical obstruction to the beam ([[slotted optical switch]]), or to [[Coupling (electronics)|couple]] two digital or analog circuits while maintaining extremely high [[electrical isolation]] between them, often for safety ([[optocoupler]]). The combination of LED and photodiode is also used in many [[sensor]] systems to characterize different types of products based on their [[absorbance|optical absorbance]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Grossi|first1=Marco|last2=Di Lecce|first2=Giuseppe|last3=Arru|first3=Marco|last4=Gallina Toschi|first4=Tullia|last5=Ricc\u00f2|first5=Bruno|title=An opto-electronic system for in-situ determination of peroxide value and total phenol content in olive oil|journal=Journal of Food Engineering|date=2015|volume=146|pages=1\u20137|doi=10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2014.08.015}}</ref>\n\nPhotodiodes are often used for accurate measurement of light intensity in science and industry.
