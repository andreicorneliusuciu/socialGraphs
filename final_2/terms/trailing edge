Aviation Supplies & Academics, 1997. ISBN 1-56027-287-2</ref> Essential [[flight control surfaces]] are attached here to redirect the air flow and exert a controlling force by changing its momentum.  Such control surfaces include [[ailerons]] on the wings for roll control, [[elevator (aircraft)|elevators]] on the [[tailplane]] controlling [[Aircraft principal axes|pitch]] and the [[rudder]] on the [[fin]] controlling [[Aircraft principal axes|yaw]]. Elevators and ailerons may be combined as [[elevons]] on [[tailless aircraft]].\n\nOther surfaces and equipment that may be attached to the trailing edge of an aircraft's wing or on its control surfaces include:\n\n*on control surfaces:\n:*[[trim tabs]]\n:*[[servo tab]]s\n:*[[anti-servo tab]]s\n*other surfaces:\n:*[[flap (aircraft)|flap]]s\n*other equipment\n:*[[Anti-shock body|anti-shock bodies]]\n:*[[static dischargers]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Aircraft components}}\n\n[[Category:Aircraft wing design]]\n\n\n{{Aviation-stub}}"}]}}}}
