The structure has no possible mechanisms, i.e. nodal displacements, compatible with zero member extensions, at least to a first-order approximation. Mathematically, the [[mass matrix]] of the structure must have full rank.\n\nKinematic determinacy can be loosely used to classify an arrangement of structural members as a ''structure'' (stable) instead of a ''mechanism'' (unstable).\n\nThe principles of kinematic determinacy are used to design precision devices such as [[mirror mount]]s for optics, and precision [[linear motion bearing]]s.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Statical determinacy]]\n* [[Precision engineering]]\n* [[Kinematic coupling]]\n{{tech-stub}}\n\n\n[[Category:Mechanical engineering]]"}]}}}}
