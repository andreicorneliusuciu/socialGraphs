A [[Cuckoo clock]] is a simple form of this type of clock.\n\nThe first known mention is of those created by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] engineer [[Vitruvius]], describing early alarm clocks working with gongs or trumpets.<ref name=\"John G.

Common figures in older clocks include [[Death (personification)|Death]] (as a reference to [[memento mori|human mortality]]), [[Old Father Time]], [[saints]] and [[angel]]s. In the [[Regency era|Regency]] and [[Victorian era|Victorian]] eras, common figures also included royalty, famous composers or industrialists.\n\nMore recently constructed automaton clocks are widespread in [[Japan]], where they are known as ''[[Karakuri ningy\u014d|karakuri]]-dokei''. Notable examples of such clocks include the Nittele \u014cdokei, designed by [[Hayao Miyazaki]] to be affixed on the [[Nippon Television]] headquarters in Tokyo, touted to be the largest animated clock in the world.<ref>[http://www.lostinjapan.com/2009/07/hayao-miyazakis-nittele-nippon-terebi-clock/ Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s Nittele Nippon Terebi Clock], Lost in Japan (blog). 4 July 2009.</ref> In the United Kingdom, [[Kit Williams]] produced a series of large automaton clocks for a handful of British [[shopping mall|shopping centre]]s, featuring frogs, ducks and fish.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Mechanical engineering]]\n[[Category:Clock designs]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]"}]}}}}
