A perfectly collimated beam, with no [[beam divergence|divergence]], would not disperse with distance. Such a beam cannot be created, due to [[diffraction]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://file.lasersaur.com/docs-thirdparty/Lasers.pdf |title=Introduction to Laser Technology |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=n.d. |website=Lasersaur |publisher=Melles Griot |access-date=5 August 2015}}</ref> \n\nLight can be approximately collimated by a number of processes, for instance by means of a [[collimator]]. Perfectly collimated light is sometimes said to be ''focused at infinity''. Thus, as the distance from a point source increases, the spherical [[wavefront]]s become flatter and closer to [[plane wave]]s, which are perfectly collimated.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"collimate\" comes from the [[Latin]] verb ''collimare'', which originated in a misreading of ''collineare'', \"to direct in a straight line\".<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=A Latin Dictionary|first=Charlton T. |last=Lewis|first2=Charles|last2=Short|location=Oxford; Medford|publisher=Clarendon Press; Perseus Digital Library|year=2010|origyear=1879|title=collimo|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=collimo}}</ref>\n\n==Sources==\n===Lasers===\n[[Laser]] light from gas or crystal lasers is highly collimated because it is formed in an [[optical cavity]] between two parallel [[mirror]]s which constrain the light to a path perpendicular to the surfaces of the mirrors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldoflasers.com/laserproperties.htm |title=Properties of Lasers |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2015 |website=World of Lasers |publisher=World of Lasers |access-date=5 August 2015 }}</ref> In practice, gas lasers can use concave mirrors, flat mirrors, or a combination of both.<ref>{{cite book |last=Joshi |date=2010 |title=Engineering Physics |publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education |page=517 |isbn=9780070704770 }}<!--|access-date=6 August 2015 --></ref><ref>{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Engineering Physics 1: For WBUT |location=India |publisher=Pearson Education India |pages=3\u20139 |date=n.d. |isbn=9788131755938 }}<!--|access-date=6 August 2015 --></ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Tipler |first=Paul |date=1992 |title=Elementary Modern Physics |publisher=MacMillan |page=149 |isbn=9780879015695 }}<!--|access-date=6 August 2015 --></ref> The divergence of high-quality laser beams is commonly less than 1 milliradian, and can be much less for large-diameter beams.

Light from the Sun is nearly collimated by the time it reaches Earth because of its distance from the Earth.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sliney |first1=David |last2=Mellerio |first2=J |date=2013 |title=Safety with Lasers and Other Optical Sources: A Comprehensive Handbook |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |page=1 |isbn=9781489935960 }}<!--|access-date=5 August 2015 --></ref>\n\n===Lenses and mirrors===\n[[Image:CollimatingLensSVG.svg|thumb|150px|right|An example of an optical collimating lens.]]A perfect [[parabolic mirror]] will bring parallel rays to a focus at a single point. Conversely, a point source at the focus of a parabolic mirror will produce a beam of collimated light creating a [[Collimator]]. Since the source needs to be small, such an optical system cannot produce much optical power. [[Spherical mirror]]s are easier to make than parabolic mirrors and they are often used to produce approximately collimated light. Many types of [[lens (optics)|lens]]es can also produce collimated light from point-like sources.\n\n===Collimated displays in flight simulators===\n[[File:Collimated display from side.svg|375px|left|Diagram of collimated display system from the side of a flight simulator]]\nThis principle is used in [[Full flight simulator|full flight simulators]] (FFS), that have specially designed systems for displaying imagery of the Out-The-Window (OTW) scene to the pilots in the replica aircraft cabin.  \n\nIn aircraft where two pilots are seated side by side, if the OTW imagery were projected in front of the pilots on a screen, one pilot would see the correct view but the other would see a view where some objects in the scene would be at incorrect angles.\n[[File:Collimation - diagram and real sim.jpg|300px|right|Diagram of collimated display system and a real flight simulator]]\nTo avoid this, collimated optics are used in the simulator visual display system so that the OTW scene is seen by both pilots at a distant focus rather than at the focal distance of a projection screen.  This is achieved through an optical system that allows the imagery to be seen by the pilots in a mirror that has a vertical curvature, the curvature enabling the image to be seen at a distant focus by both pilots, who then see essentially the same OTW scene without any distortions.\n\n==Collimation and decollimation==\n\"Collimation\" refers to all the optical elements in an instrument being on their designed [[optical axis]]. It also refers to the process\nof adjusting an optical instrument so that all its elements are on that designed axis (in line and parallel). With regards to a telescope, the term refers to the fact that the optical axis of each optical component should be centered and parallel, so that collimated light emerges from the eyepiece. Most amateur reflector telescopes need to be re-collimated every few years to maintain optimum performance. This can be done by simple visual methods such as looking down the optical assembly with no eyepiece to make sure the components are lined up, by using a [[Cheshire eyepiece]], or with the assistance of a simple laser collimator or [[autocollimator]]. Collimation can also be tested using a [[Shearing Interferometer|shearing interferometer]], which is often used to test laser collimation.  \n\n\"Decollimation\" is any mechanism or process which causes a beam with the minimum possible [[ray (optics)|ray]] divergence to diverge or converge from parallelism. Decollimation may be deliberate for systems reasons, or may be caused by many factors, such as [[refractive index]] inhomogeneities, occlusions, [[scattering]], [[Deflection (physics)|deflection]], [[diffraction]], [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]], and [[refraction]]. Decollimation must be accounted for to fully treat many systems such as [[radio]], [[radar]], [[sonar]], and optical [[Telecommunication|communications]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Autocollimation]]\n*[[Schlieren photography]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Pfister, J. & Kneedler, J.A.
