It is the [[force carrier]] for [[electromagnetic force]], even when [[Static forces and virtual-particle exchange|static]] via [[virtual photons]]. The photon has zero [[rest mass]] and as a result, the [[fundamental interactions|interactions]] of this force with matter at long distance are observable at the [[microscopic scale|microscopic]] and [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] levels. Like all elementary particles, photons are currently best explained by [[quantum mechanics]] and exhibit [[wave\u2013particle duality]], exhibiting properties of both [[wave]]s and [[wikt:particle|particles]]. For example, a single photon may be [[refraction|refracted]] by a [[Lens (optics)|lens]] and exhibit [[Interference (wave propagation)|wave interference]] with itself, and it can behave as a particle with definite and finite measurable position and [[momentum]].  The photon's wave and quanta qualities are two observable aspects of a single phenomenon, and cannot be described by any mechanical model;<ref>{{cite book|last1=Joos|first1=George|title=Theoretical Physics|date=1951|publisher=Blackie and Son Limited|location=London and Glasgow|page=679}}</ref> a representation of this dual property of light, which assumes certain points on the wavefront to be the seat of the energy, is not possible. The quanta in a light wave cannot be spatially localized.  Some defined physical parameters of a photon are listed.\n\nThe modern concept of the photon was developed gradually by [[Albert Einstein]] in the early 20th century to explain experimental observations that did not fit the classical [[electromagnetic wave equation|wave model]] of light. The benefit of the photon model was that it accounted for the frequency dependence of light's energy, and explained the ability of [[matter]] and [[electromagnetic radiation]] to be in [[thermal equilibrium]]. The photon model accounted for anomalous observations, including the properties of [[black-body radiation]], that others (notably [[Max Planck]]) had tried to explain using ''semiclassical models''. In that model, light was described by [[Maxwell's equations]], but material objects emitted and absorbed light in ''quantized'' amounts (i.e., they change energy only by certain particular discrete amounts). Although these semiclassical models contributed to the development of quantum mechanics, many further experiments<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kimble|first=H.J.|last2=Dagenais|first2=M.|last3=Mandel|first3=L.|year=1977|title=Photon Anti-bunching in Resonance Fluorescence|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=39|pages=691\u2013695|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.39.691|bibcode=1977PhRvL..39..691K|issue=11}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Grangier, P.; Roger, G.; Aspect, A.|title=Experimental Evidence for a Photon Anticorrelation Effect on a Beam Splitter: A New Light on Single-Photon Interferences|journal=[[EPL (journal)|Europhysics Letters]]|volume=1|issue=4|pages=173\u2013179|year=1986|doi=10.1209/0295-5075/1/4/004|bibcode=1986EL......1..173G|last2=Roger|last3=Aspect}}</ref> beginning with the phenomenon of [[Compton scattering]] of single photons by electrons, validated Einstein's hypothesis that ''light itself'' is [[quantization (physics)|quantized]]. In 1926 the optical physicist Frithiof Wolfers and the chemist [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] coined the name photon for these particles. After Arthur H. Compton won the Nobel Prize in 1927 for his scattering studies, most scientists accepted that light quanta have an independent existence, and the term ''photon'' was accepted.\n\nIn the [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]], photons and other elementary particles are described as a necessary consequence of physical laws having a certain [[Symmetry in physics|symmetry]] at every point in [[spacetime]]. The intrinsic properties of particles, such as [[electric charge|charge]], [[invariant mass|mass]] and [[spin (physics)|spin]], are determined by this [[gauge theory|gauge symmetry]].  The photon concept has led to momentous advances in experimental and theoretical physics, including [[laser]]s, [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensation]], [[quantum field theory]], and the [[probability amplitude|probabilistic interpretation]] of quantum mechanics. It has been applied to [[photochemistry]], [[two-photon excitation microscopy|high-resolution microscopy]], and [[fluorescence resonance energy transfer|measurements of molecular distances]]. Recently, photons have been studied as elements of [[quantum computer]]s, and for applications in [[optical imaging]] and [[optical communication]] such as [[quantum cryptography]].\n\n==Nomenclature==\nIn 1900, the German physicist [[Max Planck]] was studying black-body radiation and suggested that the energy carried by electromagnetic waves could only be released in \"packets\" of energy. In his 1901 article <ref name=\"Planck1901\"/> in ''[[Annalen der Physik]]'' he called these packets \"energy elements\". The word [[Quantum|''quanta'']] (singular ''quantum,'' Latin for ''[[wikt:quantum|how much]]'') was used before 1900 to mean particles or amounts of different [[Quantity|quantities]], including [[electron|electricity]]. In 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] suggested that electromagnetic waves could only exist as discrete wave-packets.<ref name=\"Einstein1905\">{{cite journal|last=Einstein|first=A.|authorlink=Albert Einstein|year=1905|title=\u00dcber einen die Erzeugung und Verwandlung des Lichtes betreffenden heuristischen Gesichtspunkt|url=http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/einstein-papers/1905_17_132-148.pdf|journal=[[Annalen der Physik]]|volume=17|pages=132\u2013148|doi=10.1002/andp.19053220607|bibcode=1905AnP...322..132E|issue=6|language=de}}.

In the [[center of momentum frame]], the colliding antiparticles have no net momentum, whereas a single photon always has momentum (since, as we have seen, it is determined by the photon's frequency or wavelength, which cannot be zero). Hence, [[momentum|conservation of momentum]] (or equivalently, [[translational invariance]]) requires that at least two photons are created, with zero net momentum. (However, it is possible if the system interacts with another particle or field for the annihilation to produce one photon, as when a positron annihilates with a bound atomic electron, it is possible for only one photon to be emitted, as the nuclear Coulomb field breaks translational symmetry.)<ref name=Griffiths2008>{{citation| author=Griffiths, David J.|title=Introduction to Elementary Particles|edition=2nd revised| publisher=WILEY-VCH |year=2008|isbn= 978-3-527-40601-2}}</ref>{{rp|64\u201365}} The energy of the two photons, or, equivalently, their frequency, may be determined from [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation of four-momentum]].

He noticed that a light quantum with energy proportional to its frequency would explain a number of troubling puzzles and paradoxes, including an unpublished law by Stokes, the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]], and the [[photoelectric effect]]. Stokes's law said simply that the frequency of fluorescent light cannot be greater than the frequency of the light (usually ultraviolet) inducing it. Einstein eliminated the ultraviolet catastrophe by imagining a gas of photons behaving like a gas of electrons that he had previously considered. He was advised by a colleague to be careful how he wrote up this paper, in order to not challenge Planck, a powerful figure in physics, too directly, and indeed the warning was justified, as Planck never forgave him for writing it.<ref>''Einstein and the Quantum: The Quest of the Valiant Swabian'', A.

The condition follows from the assumption that functions of the emission and absorption of radiation by the atoms are independent of each other, and that thermal equilibrium is made by way of the radiation's interaction with the atoms. Consider a cavity in [[thermal equilibrium]] with all parts of itself and filled with [[electromagnetic radiation]] and that the atoms can emit and absorb that radiation. Thermal equilibrium requires that the energy density <math>\\rho(\\nu)</math> of photons with frequency <math>\\nu</math> (which is proportional to their [[number density]]) is, on average, constant in time; hence, the rate at which photons of any particular frequency are ''emitted'' must equal the rate at which they ''absorb'' them.<ref name=\"Einstein1916a\">{{cite journal|last=Einstein|first=A.|authorlink=Albert Einstein|year=1916|title=Strahlungs-emission und -absorption nach der Quantentheorie|journal=[[Verhandlungen der Deutschen Physikalischen Gesellschaft]]|volume=18|pages=318\u2013323|bibcode=1916DPhyG..18..318E|language=de}}</ref>\n\nEinstein began by postulating simple proportionality relations for the different reaction rates involved. In his model, the rate <math>R_{ji}</math> for a system to ''absorb'' a photon of frequency <math>\\nu</math> and transition from a lower energy <math>E_{j}</math> to a higher energy <math>E_{i}</math> is proportional to the number <math>N_{j}</math> of atoms with energy <math>E_{j}</math> and to the energy density <math>\\rho(\\nu)</math> of ambient photons of that frequency,\n\n:<math>\nR_{ji}=N_{j} B_{ji} \\rho(\\nu) \\!\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>B_{ji}</math> is the [[rate constant]] for absorption. For the reverse process, there are two possibilities: spontaneous emission of a photon, or the emission of a photon initiated by the interaction of the atom with a passing photon and the return of the atom to the lower-energy state. Following Einstein's approach, the corresponding rate <math>R_{ij}</math> for the emission of photons of frequency <math>\\nu</math> and transition from a higher energy <math>E_{i}</math> to a lower energy <math>E_{j}</math> is\n\n:<math>\nR_{ij}=N_{i} A_{ij} + N_{i} B_{ij} \\rho(\\nu) \\!\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>A_{ij}</math> is the rate constant for [[spontaneous emission|emitting a photon spontaneously]], and <math>B_{ij}</math> is the rate constant for emissions in response to ambient photons ([[stimulated emission|induced or stimulated emission]]). In thermodynamic equilibrium, the number of atoms in state i and those in state j must, on average, be constant; hence, the rates <math>R_{ji}</math> and <math>R_{ij}</math> must be equal. Also, by arguments analogous to the derivation of [[Boltzmann statistics]], the ratio of <math>N_{i}</math> and <math>N_{j}</math> is <math>g_i/g_j\\exp{(E_j-E_i)/(kT)},</math> where <math>g_{i,j}</math> are the [[degenerate energy level|degeneracy]] of the state i and that of j, respectively, <math>E_{i,j}</math> their energies, k the [[Boltzmann constant]] and T the system's [[temperature]].

The particular form of the [[electromagnetic interaction]] specifies that the photon must have [[spin (physics)|spin]] \u00b11; thus, its [[helicity (particle physics)|helicity]] must be <math>\\pm \\hbar</math>. These two spin components correspond to the classical concepts of [[circular polarization|right-handed and left-handed circularly polarized]] light. However, the transient [[virtual photon]]s of [[quantum electrodynamics]] may also adopt unphysical polarization states.<ref name=\"Ryder\" />\n\nIn the prevailing [[Standard Model]] of physics, the photon is one of four [[gauge bosons]] in the [[electroweak interaction]]; the [[W and Z bosons|other three]] are denoted W<sup>+</sup>, W<sup>\u2212</sup> and Z<sup>0</sup> and are responsible for the [[weak interaction]]. Unlike the photon, these gauge bosons have [[invariant mass|mass]], owing to a [[Higgs mechanism|mechanism]] that breaks their [[special unitary group|SU(2) gauge symmetry]]. The unification of the photon with W and Z gauge bosons in the electroweak interaction was accomplished by [[Sheldon Glashow]], [[Abdus Salam]] and [[Steven Weinberg]], for which they were awarded the 1979 [[Nobel Prize]] in physics.<ref name=\"Glashow\">[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1979/glashow-lecture.html Sheldon Glashow Nobel lecture], delivered 8 December 1979.</ref><ref name=\"Salam\">[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1979/salam-lecture.html Abdus Salam Nobel lecture], delivered 8 December 1979.</ref><ref name=\"Weinberg\">[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1979/weinberg-lecture.html Steven Weinberg Nobel lecture], delivered 8 December 1979.</ref> Physicists continue to hypothesize [[grand unification theory|grand unified theories]] that connect these four [[gauge boson]]s with the eight [[gluon]] gauge bosons of [[quantum chromodynamics]]; however, key predictions of these theories, such as [[proton decay]], have not been observed experimentally.<ref>E.g., chapter 14 in {{cite book|last=Hughes|first=I.

Similarly, the mass of a system that absorbs a photon is ''increased'' by a corresponding amount. As an application, the energy balance of nuclear reactions involving photons is commonly written in terms of the masses of the nuclei involved, and terms of the form <math>{E}/{c^2}</math> for the gamma photons (and for other relevant energies, such as the recoil energy of nuclei).<ref>E.g., section 10.1 in {{Cite book|last=Dunlap|first=R.A.|title=An Introduction to the Physics of Nuclei and Particles|publisher=[[Cengage Learning#Brands/imprints|Brooks/Cole]]|year=2004|isbn=0-534-39294-6}}</ref>\n\nThis concept is applied in key predictions of [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED, see above). In that theory, the mass of electrons (or, more generally, leptons) is modified by including the mass contributions of virtual photons, in a technique known as [[renormalization]]. Such \"[[radiative correction]]s\" contribute to a number of predictions of QED, such as the [[anomalous magnetic dipole moment|magnetic dipole moment]] of [[lepton]]s, the [[Lamb shift]], and the [[hyperfine structure]] of bound lepton pairs, such as [[muonium]] and [[positronium]].<ref>Radiative correction to electron mass section 7-1-2, anomalous magnetic moments section 7-2-1, Lamb shift section 7-3-2 and hyperfine splitting in positronium section 10-3 in {{Cite book|last=Itzykson|first=C.|last2=Zuber|first2=J.-B.|title=Quantum Field Theory|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1980|isbn=0-07-032071-3}}</ref>\n\nSince photons contribute to the [[stress\u2013energy tensor]], they exert a [[gravity|gravitational attraction]] on other objects, according to the theory of [[general relativity]]. Conversely, photons are themselves affected by gravity; their normally straight trajectories may be bent by warped [[spacetime]], as in [[gravitational lens]]ing, and [[gravitational redshift|their frequencies may be lowered]] by moving to a higher [[potential energy|gravitational potential]], as in the [[Pound\u2013Rebka experiment]]. However, these effects are not specific to photons; exactly the same effects would be predicted for classical [[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic waves]].<ref>E. g. sections 9.1 (gravitational contribution of photons) and 10.5 (influence of gravity on light) in {{Cite book|last=Stephani|first=H.|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=V04_vLQvstcC|page=86}}|last2=Stewart|first2=J.|pages=86 ff, 108 ff.|title=General Relativity: An Introduction to the Theory of Gravitational Field|isbn=0-521-37941-5|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1990}}</ref>\n\n==Photons in matter==\n{{See also|Group velocity|Photochemistry}}\n\nLight that travels through transparent matter does so at a lower speed than ''c'', the speed of light in a vacuum.

The factor by which the speed is decreased is called the [[refractive index]] of the material. In a classical wave picture, the slowing can be explained by the light inducing [[electric polarization]] in the matter, the polarized matter radiating new light, and that new light interfering with the original light wave to form a delayed wave. In a particle picture, the slowing can instead be described as a blending of the photon with quantum excitations of the matter to produce [[quasi-particle]]s known as [[polariton]] (other quasi-particles are [[phonon]]s and [[exciton]]s); this polariton has a nonzero [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]], which means that it cannot travel at ''c''. Light of different frequencies may travel through matter at [[variable speed of light|different speeds]]; this is called [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] (not to be confused with scattering). In some cases, it can result in [[slow light|extremely slow speeds of light]] in matter. The effects of photon interactions with other quasi-particles may be observed directly in [[Raman scattering]] and [[Brillouin scattering]].<ref>Polaritons section 10.10.1, Raman and Brillouin scattering section 10.11.3 in {{Cite book | last = Patterson | first=J.D. | last2 = Bailey | first2=B.C.| title = Solid-State Physics: Introduction to the Theory| publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]| year=2007| isbn=3-540-24115-9}}</ref>\n\nPhotons can also be [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbed]] by nuclei, atoms or molecules, provoking transitions between their [[energy level]]s. A classic example is the molecular transition of [[retinal]] (C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>28</sub>O), which is responsible for [[Visual perception|vision]], as discovered in 1958 by Nobel laureate [[biochemistry|biochemist]] [[George Wald]] and co-workers. The absorption provokes a [[cis-trans]] [[isomerization]] that, in combination with other such transitions, is transduced into nerve impulses. The absorption of photons can even break chemical bonds, as in the [[photodissociation]] of [[chlorine]]; this is the subject of [[photochemistry]].<ref>E.g. section 11-5 C in {{Cite book|last=Pine|first=S.H.|last2=Hendrickson |first2=J.B.|last3=Cram |first3=D.J.|last4=Hammond |first4=G.S.|title=Organic Chemistry|edition=4th|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|year=1980|isbn=0-07-050115-7}}</ref><ref>Nobel lecture given by G.

These examples are chosen to illustrate applications of photons ''per se'', rather than general optical devices such as lenses, etc. that could operate under a classical theory of light. The laser is an extremely important application and is discussed above under [[stimulated emission]].\n\nIndividual photons can be detected by several methods. The classic [[photomultiplier]] tube exploits the [[photoelectric effect]]: a photon of sufficient energy strikes a metal plate and knocks free an electron, initiating an ever-amplifying avalanche of electrons. [[Semiconductor]] [[charge-coupled device]] chips use a similar effect: an incident photon generates a charge on a microscopic [[capacitor]] that can be detected. Other detectors such as [[Geiger counter]]s use the ability of photons to [[ionize]] gas molecules contained in the device, causing a detectable change of [[Electrical conductivity|conductivity]] of the gas.<ref>Photomultiplier section 1.1.10, CCDs section 1.1.8, Geiger counters section 1.3.2.1 in {{cite book|first=C.R.|last=Kitchin|title=Astrophysical Techniques|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton (FL)|year=2008|isbn=1-4200-8243-4}}</ref>\n\nPlanck's energy formula <math>E=h\\nu</math> is often used by engineers and chemists in design, both to compute the change in energy resulting from a photon absorption and to determine the frequency of the light emitted from a given photon emission. For example, the [[emission spectrum]] of a [[gas-discharge lamp]] can be altered by filling it with (mixtures of) gases with different electronic [[energy level]] configurations.\n\nUnder some conditions, an energy transition can be excited by \"two\" photons that individually would be insufficient. This allows for higher resolution microscopy, because the sample absorbs energy only in the spectrum  where two beams of different colors overlap significantly, which can be made much smaller than the excitation volume of a single beam (see [[two-photon excitation microscopy]]). Moreover, these photons cause less damage to the sample, since they are of lower energy.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Denk, W. |author2=Svoboda, K. |title=Photon upmanship: Why multiphoton imaging is more than a gimmick|journal=[[Neuron (journal)|Neuron]]|volume=18|issue=3|pages=351\u2013357|year=1997|pmid=9115730|doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(00)81237-4}}</ref>\n\nIn some cases, two energy transitions can be coupled so that, as one system absorbs a photon, another nearby system \"steals\" its energy and re-emits a photon of a different frequency. This is the basis of [[fluorescence resonance energy transfer]], a technique that is used in [[molecular biology]] to study the interaction of suitable [[protein]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|first=J.R.|last=Lakowicz|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=-PSybuLNxcAC|page=529}}|title=Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy|pages=529 ff|publisher=Springer|year=2006|isbn=0-387-31278-1}}</ref>\n\nSeveral different kinds of [[hardware random number generator]]s involve the detection of single photons. In one example, for each bit in the random sequence that is to be produced, a photon is sent to a [[beam-splitter]]. In such a situation, there are two possible outcomes of equal probability. The actual outcome is used to determine whether the next bit in the sequence is \"0\" or \"1\".<ref>{{Cite journal|first=T.|last=Jennewein|first2=U.|last2=Achleitner|first3=G.|last3=Weihs|first4=H.|last4=Weinfurter|first5=A.|last5=Zeilinger|title=A fast and compact quantum random number generator|doi=10.1063/1.1150518|journal=[[Review of Scientific Instruments]]|volume=71|pages=1675\u20131680|year=2000|arxiv=quant-ph/9912118|bibcode=2000RScI...71.1675J|issue=4 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|first=A.|last=Stefanov|first2=N.|last2=Gisin|first3=O.|last3=Guinnard|first4=L.|last4=Guinnard|first5=H.|last5=Zbiden|title=Optical quantum random number generator|journal=[[Journal of Modern Optics]]|volume=47|pages=595\u2013598|year=2000|doi=10.1080/095003400147908|issue=4}}</ref>\n\n==Recent research==\n{{See also|Quantum optics}}\n\nMuch research has been devoted to applications of photons in the field of [[quantum optics]].

[[Nonlinear optics|Nonlinear optical processes]] are another active research area, with topics such as [[two-photon absorption]], [[self-phase modulation]], [[modulational instability]] and [[optical parametric oscillator]]s. However, such processes generally do not require the assumption of photons ''per se''; they may often be modeled by treating atoms as nonlinear oscillators. The nonlinear process of [[spontaneous parametric down conversion]] is often used to produce single-photon states.
