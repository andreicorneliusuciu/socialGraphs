A balloon may be free, moving with the wind, or [[Moored balloon|tethered]] to a fixed point. It is distinct from an [[airship]], which is a powered [[aerostat]] that can propel itself through the air in a controlled manner.\n\n{{Anchor|Gondola}}Many balloons have a [[basket]], [[gondola (airship)|gondola]] or capsule suspended beneath the main envelope for carrying people or equipment (including cameras and [[telescope]]s, and flight-control mechanisms).\n\n==Principles==\nA [[balloon]] is conceptually the simplest of all flying machines. The balloon is a fabric envelope filled with a gas that is [[lighter than air|lighter than the surrounding atmosphere]]. As the entire balloon is less [[density|dense]] than its surroundings, it rises, taking along with it a basket, attached underneath, which carries passengers or payload.  Although a balloon has no propulsion system, a degree of directional control is possible through making the balloon rise or sink in altitude to find favorable wind directions.\n\nThere are three main types of balloon:\n*The [[hot air balloon]] or ''Montgolfi\u00e8re'' obtains its buoyancy by heating the air inside the balloon; it has become the most common type.\n*The [[gas balloon]] or ''Charli\u00e8re'' is inflated with a gas of lower [[molecular mass|molecular weight]] than the ambient atmosphere; most gas balloons operate with the internal pressure of the gas the same as the [[atmospheric pressure|pressure of the surrounding atmosphere]]; a [[superpressure balloon]] can operate with the [[lifting gas]] at pressure that exceeds that of the surrounding air, with the objective of limiting or eliminating the loss of gas from day-time heating; gas balloons are filled with gases such as:\n**[[hydrogen]] \u2013 originally used extensively but, since the [[Hindenburg disaster]], is now seldom used due to its high flammability;\n**[[coal gas]] \u2013 although giving around half the lift of hydrogen,<ref>Holmes, Richard (2013). ''Falling Upwards''. London: Collins. ISBN 978-0-00-738692-5. p.57</ref> extensively used during the nineteenth and early twentieth century, since it was cheaper than hydrogen and readily available;\n**[[helium]] \u2013 used today for all airships and most manned gas balloons;\n**other gases have included [[ammonia]] and [[methane]], but these have poor lifting capacity and other safety defects and have never been widely used.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.chem.hawaii.edu/uham/lift.html\n| title = Balloon Lift with Lighter than Air Gases: Methane\n| publisher=UH Manoa Chemistry Department\n| accessdate = 2010-05-24}}</ref>\n*The ''[[Rozi\u00e8re balloon|Rozi\u00e8re]]'' type has both heated and unheated lifting gases in separate gasbags. This type of balloon is sometimes used for long-distance record flights, such as the [[Circumnavigation#Notable aerial circumnavigations|recent circumnavigations]], but is not otherwise in use.\n\nBoth the hot air, or Montgolfi\u00e8re, balloon and the gas balloon are still in common use. Montgolfi\u00e8re balloons are relatively inexpensive, as they do not require high-grade materials for their envelopes, and they are popular for balloonist sport activity.\n\n===Hot air balloons===\n{{main|Hot air balloon}}\n[[File:Luftballong.jpg|right|thumb|Hot air balloons, San Diego]]\n[[File:Ballon.ogv|thumb|Hot air balloon taking off]]\n\nThe first balloon which carried passengers used hot air to obtain buoyancy and was built by the brothers [[Montgolfier brothers|Josef and Etienne Montgolfier]] in [[Annonay]], France in 1783: the first passenger flight was 19 September 1783, carrying a sheep, a duck, and a rooster.\n\nThe first tethered manned balloon flight was by a larger Montgolfier balloon, probably on 15 October 1783.  The first free balloon flight was by the same Montgolfier balloon on 21 November 1783.\n\nWhen heated, air expands, so a given volume of space contains less air. This makes it lighter and, if its lifting power is greater than the weight of the balloon containing it, it will lift the balloon upwards. A hot air balloon can only stay up while it has fuel for its burner, to keep the air hot enough.\n\nThe Montgolfiers' early hot air balloons used a solid-fuel brazier which proved less practical than the hydrogen balloons that had followed almost immediately, and hot air ballooning soon died out.\n\nIn the 1950s, the convenience and low cost of bottled gas burners led to a revival of hot air ballooning for sport and leisure.\n\nThe height or altitude of a hot air balloon is controlled by turning the burner up or down as needed, unlike a gas balloon where ballast weights are often carried so that they can be dropped if the balloon gets too low, and in order to land some lifting gas must be vented through a valve.\n\n===Gas balloons===\n{{main|Gas balloon}}\nA man-carrying balloon using the light gas hydrogen for buoyancy was made by Professor [[Jacques Charles]] and flown less than a month after the Montgolfier flight, on 1 December 1783. Gas balloons have greater [[lift (force)|lift]] for a given volume, so they do not need to be so large, and they can also stay up for much longer than hot air, so gas balloons dominated ballooning for the next 200 years. In the 19th century, it was common to use [[town gas]] to fill balloons; this was not as light as pure hydrogen gas, having about half the lifting power, but it was much cheaper and readily available.\n\n[[File:GasballoonsABQ.jpg|thumb|left|Gas balloons at the [[Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta]]]]\nLight gas balloons are predominant in scientific applications, as they are capable of reaching much higher altitudes for much longer periods of time. They are generally filled with helium. Although hydrogen has more lifting power, it is explosive in an atmosphere rich in [[oxygen]]. With a few exceptions, scientific balloon missions are unmanned.\n\nThere are two types of light-gas balloons: zero-pressure and superpressure. Zero-pressure balloons are the traditional form of light-gas balloon. They are partially inflated with the light gas before launch, with the gas pressure the same both inside and outside the balloon. As the zero-pressure balloon rises, its gas expands to maintain the zero pressure difference, and the balloon's envelope swells.\n\nAt night, the gas in a zero-pressure balloon cools and contracts, causing the balloon to sink. A zero-pressure balloon can only maintain altitude by releasing gas when it goes too high, where the expanding gas can threaten to rupture the envelope, or releasing ballast when it sinks too low. Loss of gas and ballast limits the endurance of zero-pressure balloons to a few days.\n\nA [[superpressure balloon]], in contrast, has a tough and inelastic envelope that is filled with light gas to pressure higher than that of the external atmosphere, and then sealed. The superpressure balloon cannot change size greatly, and so maintains a generally constant volume. The superpressure balloon maintains an altitude of constant density in the atmosphere, and can maintain flight until gas leakage gradually brings it down.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space-travel.com/reports/Successful_Flight_Of_NASA_Prototype_Super_Pressure_Balloon_In_Antarctica_999.html |title=Successful Flight Of NASA Prototype Super-Pressure Balloon In Antarctica |publisher=Space-travel.com |accessdate=2011-06-18}}</ref>\n\nSuperpressure balloons offer flight endurance of months, rather than days. In fact, in typical operation an Earth-based superpressure balloon mission is ended by a command from ground control to open the envelope, rather than by natural leakage of gas.\n\n[[High-altitude balloon]]s are used as high flying vessels to carry scientific instruments (like [[weather balloon]]s), or reach near-space altitudes to take footage or photos of the earth. These balloons can fly over 100,000 feet (30.5&nbsp;km) into the air, and are designed to burst at a set altitude where the parachute will deploy to safely carry the payload back to earth.<ref>{{cite web|last=Von Glahn|first=Rick|title=What we Do|url=http://www.eoss.org/pubs/eossinfo.htm#2|work=Edge of Space Sciences|accessdate=29 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Cluster ballooning]] uses many smaller gas-filled balloons for flight (see [http://www.clusterballoon.org/intro/intro.html An Introduction to Cluster Ballooning]).\n\n===Combination balloons===\nEarly hot air balloons could not stay up for very long because they used a lot of fuel, while early hydrogen balloons were difficult to take higher or lower as desired because the aeronaut could only vent the gas or drop off ballast a limited number of times. [[Pil\u00e2tre de Rozier]] realised that for a long-distance flight such as crossing the  [[English Channel]], the aeronaut would need to make use of the differing wind directions at different altitudes. It would be essential therefore to have good control of altitude while still able to stay up for a long time. He developed a combination balloon having two gas bags, the [[Rozier balloon]]. The upper one held hydrogen and provided most of the steady lift. The lower one held hot air and could be quickly heated or cooled to provide the varying lift for good altitude control.\n\nIn 1785 Pil\u00e2tre de Rozier took off in an attempt to fly across the Channel, but shortly into the flight the hydrogen gas bag caught fire and de Rozier did not survive the ensuing accident. This earned de Rozier the title \"The First to Fly and the First to Die\".\n\nIt wasn't until the 1980s that technology was developed to allow safe operation of the Rozier type, for example by using non-flammable helium as the lifting gas, and several designs have successfully undertaken long-distance flights.\n\n===Tethering and kite balloons===\n{{main|Kite balloon}}\n[[File:static.balloon.bristol.arp.jpg|thumb|A tethered [[helium]] balloon gives the public rides to <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">500&nbsp;feet&nbsp;(150&nbsp;m)</span> above the city of [[Bristol]], England. The inset shows detail of the gondola.]]\nAs an alternative to free flight, a balloon may be [[Tethered balloon|tethered]] to allow reliable take off and landing at the same location. Some of the earliest balloon flights were tethered for safety, and since then balloons have been tethered for many purposes, including military observation and aerial barrage, meteorological and commercial uses.\n\nThe natural spherical shape of a balloon is unstable in high winds. Tethered balloons for use in windy conditions are often stabilised by aerodynamic shaping and connecting to the tether by a halter arrangement. These are called [[kite balloon]]s.\n\nA kite balloon is distinct from a [[kytoon]], which obtains a portion of its lift aerodynamically.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of ballooning}}\n\n===Antecedents===\n[[File:SkyLanternRichy01.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A modern Kongming Lantern]]\n[[File:Passarola.png|thumb|[[Bartolomeu de Gusm\u00e3o]]\u2019s airship ''Passarola'' flew in 1709 in Lisbon.]]\nUnmanned hot air balloons are popular in Chinese history.

A public demonstration occurred in [[Brugherio]] a few days later, on March 13, 1784, when the vehicle flew to a height of 1,537 metres (5,043&nbsp;ft) and a distance of 8 kilometres (5.0&nbsp;mi).<ref>[http://www.aerostati.it/andreani.htm\"Grandi personaggi Paolo Andreani (1763 - 1823)\",  Aerostati.it  On line (in Italian).]</ref>  On March 28 Andreani received a standing ovation at [[La Scala]], and later a medal from [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]].\n\nDe Rozier, together with [[Joseph Proust]], took part in a further flight on 23 June 1784, in a modified version of the Montgolfiers' first balloon christened La [[Marie-Antoinette]] after the Queen. They took off in front of the King of France and King [[Gustav III]] of Sweden. The balloon flew north at an altitude of approximately 3,000 metres, above the clouds, travelling 52&nbsp;km in 45 minutes before cold and turbulence forced them to descend past [[Luzarches]], between [[Coye]] et [[Orry-la-Ville]], near the Chantilly forest.\n\nThe first balloon ascent in Britain was made by [[James Tytler]] on 25 August 1784 at [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, in a [[hot air balloon]].\n\nThe first aircraft disaster occurred in May 1785 when the town of [[Tullamore]], [[County Offaly]], Ireland was seriously damaged when the crash of a balloon resulted in a fire that burned down about 100 houses, making the town home to the world's first [[Aviation accidents and incidents|aviation disaster]].

On 2 April 1794, an aeronauts corps was created in the French army; however, given the logistical problems linked with the production of hydrogen on the battlefield (it required constructing ovens and pouring water on white-hot iron), the corps was disbanded in 1799.\n\nThe first major use of balloons in the military occurred during the [[American Civil War]] with the [[Union Army Balloon Corps]] established in 1861.\n\n[[File:World War I Observation Balloon HD-SN-99-02269.JPEG|thumb|upright|right|Close-up view of an American major in the basket of an [[observation balloon]] flying over territory near front lines during World War I.]]\n\nDuring the [[Paraguayan War]] (1864\u201370), observation balloons were used by the [[Brazilian Army]].\n\nBalloons were used by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[Royal Engineers]] in 1885 for reconnaissance and observation purposes during the [[Bechuanaland Protectorate|Bechuanaland Expedition]] and the [[Nile Expedition|Sudan Expedition]]. Although experiments in Britain had been conducted as early as 1863, a [[School of Ballooning]] was not established at [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham, Medway, Kent]] until 1888. During the [[Second Boer War|Anglo-Boer War]] (1899\u20131902), use was made of observation balloons.

Observers phoned their reports to officers on the ground who then relayed the information to those who needed it. Balloons were frequently targets of opposing aircraft. Planes assigned to attack enemy balloons were often equipped with [[incendiary bullet]]s, for the purpose of igniting the hydrogen.\n\nThe [[Aeronaut Badge]] was established by the [[United States Army]] in World War I to denote service members who were qualified balloon pilots.

[[PAGEOS]] was launched in 1966 for worldwide satellite triangulation, allowing for greater precision in the calculation of different locations on the planet's surface.\n\n====Planetary probes====\n[[File:Aeronautics 02505u-grayscale.jpg|thumb|Lana's aeronautic machine]]\nIn 1984, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] space probes [[Vega program|Vega 1 and Vega 2]] released two balloons with scientific experiments in the atmosphere of [[Venus]]. They transmitted signals for two days to Earth.\n\n==Ballooning records==\nOn 19 October 1910, [[Alan R. Hawley|Alan Hawley]] and [[Augustus Post]] landed in the wilderness of Quebec, Canada after traveling for 48 hours and 1887.6 kilometers (1,173 mi) from St. Louis during the [[Gordon Bennett Cup in ballooning|Gordon Bennett International Balloon Race]], setting a distance record that held for more than 20 years. It took the men a week to hike out of the woods, during which time search parties had been mobilized and many had taken the pair for dead. <ref> {{cite web| url = http://www.fai.org/2014-04-24-15-13-23/results | title = Ballooning World Records | accessdate = 2016-04-15| author = The International Air Sports Federation (FAI)}}</ref>\n\nOn 13 December 1913 through 17 December 1913 [[Hugo Kaulen]] stayed aloft for 87 hours.

Orvil A. Anderson, Maj. William E. Kepner and Capt. Albert W. Stevens, reached a new record height of 22,066 m (72,395&nbsp;ft) on 11 November 1935. This followed the same crew's previous near-fatal plunge in July 1934 in a predecessor craft, ''Explorer'', after its canopy ruptured just 190&nbsp;m (624&nbsp;ft) short (it transpired) of the then-current altitude record of 22,000 m (72,178&nbsp;ft) set by the Soviet balloon ''[[Osoaviakhim-1]]''.\n\nIn 1976, [[Ed Yost]] set 13 aviation world\u2019s records for distance traveled and amount of time aloft in his attempt to cross the [[Atlantic Ocean]] \u2014solo\u2014 by balloon (3.938&nbsp;km, 107:37 h).\n\nThe current absolute altitude record for manned balloon flight was set at 34,668 m (113,739&nbsp;ft) on 4 May 1961 by [[Malcolm Ross (balloonist)|Malcolm Ross]] and [[Victor Prather]] in the [[Project Strato-Lab|Strato-Lab V]] balloon payload launched from the deck of the [[USS Antietam (CV-36)|USS ''Antietam'']] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].{{efn|name=FAIAbsoluteAltitute|The 4 May 1961 FAI Absolute Altitude (#2325) record for balloon flight set by [[Malcolm Ross (balloonist)|Malcolm Ross]] and [[Victor Prather]] is still current, as it requires the balloonist to descend with the balloon.
