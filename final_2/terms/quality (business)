Quality is a perceptual, conditional, and somewhat subjective attribute and may be understood differently by different people. Consumers may focus on the '''specification quality''' of a product/service, or how it compares to competitors in the marketplace. Producers might measure the '''conformance quality''', or degree to which the product/service was [[Conformance testing|produced correctly]].  \n\nSupport personnel may measure quality in the degree that a product is [[wikt:reliable|reliable]], [[Maintainability|maintainable]], or [[Sustainability|sustainable]]. A quality item (an item that has quality) has the ability to perform satisfactorily in service and is suitable for its intended purpose.\n\n==Description==\nThere are five aspects of quality in a business context:\n\n# [[Production (economics)|Producing]] \u2013 providing something.\n# Checking \u2013 confirming that something has been done correctly.\n# [[Quality control|Quality Control]] \u2013 controlling a process to ensure that the outcomes are predictable.\n# [[Quality Management]] \u2013 directing an organization so that it optimizes its performance through analysis and improvement.\n# [[Quality Assurance]] \u2013 obtaining confidence that a product or service will be satisfactory. (Normally performed by a purchaser)\n\nQuality applied in these forms was mainly developed by the procurement directorates of NASA, the military and nuclear industries from the 1960s and this is why so much emphasis was placed on Quality Assurance. The original versions of Quality Management System Standards (eventually merged to ISO 9001) were designed to contract manufacturers to produce better products, consistently and were focused on Producing, Checking and Quality Control.\n\nThe subsequent move of the Quality sector towards management systems can be clearly seen by the aggregation of the product quality requirements into one eighth of the current version of ISO 9001. This increased focus on Quality Management has promoted a general perception that quality is about procedures and documentation. Similar experiences can be seen in the areas of Safety Management Systems and Environmental Management Systems.\n\nThe emergence of tools like Asset Optimization and 6 sigma is an interesting development in the application of quality principles in business.\n\nManaging quality is fundamental to any activity and having a clear understanding of the five aspects, measuring performance and taking action to improve is essential to an organizations survival and growth.\n\n==Notable definitions==\nThe common element of the business definitions is that the quality of a product or service refers to the perception of the degree to which the product or service meets the customer's expectations. Quality has no specific meaning unless related to a specific function and/or object.\n\nThe business meanings of ''quality'' have developed over time. Various interpretations are given below:\n# [[American Society for Quality]]: \"A combination of quantitative and qualitative perspectives for which each person has his or her own definition; examples of which include, \"Meeting the [[requirements]] and expectations in service or product that were committed to\" and \"Pursuit of optimal solutions contributing to confirmed successes, fulfilling accountabilities\".  In technical usage, quality can have two meanings:\n#:a. The characteristics of a product or service that bear on its ability to satisfy stated or implied needs;\n#:b. A product or service free of deficiencies.\"<ref name=\"ASQglossaryQ\" />\n# [[Subir Chowdhury]]: \"Quality combines people power and process power.\"<ref>{{Cite book\n  | first = Subir\n  | last = Chowdhury\n  | title = The Ice Cream Maker: An Inspiring Tale About Making Quality The Key Ingredient in Everything You Do\n  | publisher = Doubleday, Random House\n  | year = 2005\n  | location = New York\n  | isbn = 978-0-385-51478-1}}</ref>\n# [[Philip B.

However, this has not been the case historically, and in the early 19th century it was recognized that some markets, such as those in Asia, preferred cheaper products to those of quality.<ref>p.169, Rochfort Scott, Hamerton</ref>\nMost discussions of quality refer to a finished part, wherever it is in the process. Inspection, which is what quality insurance usually means, is historical, since the work is done. The best way to think about quality is in process control. If the process is under control, inspection is not necessary.\n\nHowever, there is one characteristic of modern quality that is universal.  In the past, when we tried to improve quality, typically defined as producing fewer defective parts, we did so at the expense of increased cost, increased task time, longer cycle time, etc.  We could not get fewer defective parts and lower cost and shorter cycle times, and so on.  However, when modern quality techniques are applied correctly to business, engineering, manufacturing or assembly processes, all aspects of quality \u2013 [[customer satisfaction]] ''and'' fewer defects/errors ''and'' cycle time ''and'' task time/productivity ''and'' total cost, etc. \u2013 must all improve or, if one of these aspects does not improve,  it must at least stay stable and not decline.  Therefore, modern quality has the characteristic that it creates [[logical and|AND]]-based benefits, not OR-based benefits.\n\nQuality, especially in manufacturing and diverse industries, is regulated, tested, and certified. Diverse methods, models and standards are provided to test the quality. For instance, the fitness for use (FFU), concept introduced to help test the quality of various types of [[electrical]] and [[electronics|electronic]] equipment, including [[household appliances]] and video/audio equipment. All types of equipment are manufactured in accordance to relevant standards, including performance testing requirements. FFU testing means testing products to ensure their \u2018fitness for purpose\u2019; that is, to certify their quality as well as durability.\n\n===Customers===\nOne view of quality is that it is defined entirely by the customer or end user, and is based upon that person's evaluation of his or her entire customer experience{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}.  The customer experience is defined as the aggregate of all the interactions that customers have with the company's products and services.  For example, any time one buys a product, one forms an impression based on how it was sold, how it was delivered, how it performed, how well it was supported etc.\n\n==Quality management techniques==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-1-of-3}}\n*[[Quality management system]]s\n*[[Total quality management]] (TQM)\n*[[Design of experiments]]\n**[[Fractional factorial design]]\n**[[Optimal design]]\n**[[Response surface methodology]]\n{{col-2-of-3}}\n*[[Continuous improvement]]\n*[[Six Sigma]]\n*[[Statistical Process Control]] (SPC)\n*[[Quality circle]]s\n*[[Requirements analysis]]\n*[[Verification and validation]]\n*[[Zero Defects]]\n*[[Service quality]]\n*[[SERVQUAL]]\n{{col-3-of-3}}\n*[[Theory of Constraints]] (TOC)\n*[[Business process management]] (BPM)\n*[[Business process re-engineering]]\n*[[Capability Maturity Model]]s\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Quality awards==\n{{Main|List of national quality awards}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n*[[Deming Prize]]\n*[[EFQM Excellence Award]]\n*[[Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|3}}\n* [[Common law of business balance]]\n* [[Eight dimensions of quality]]\n* [[ISO 9000]]\n* [[Metaphysics of quality]]\n* [[Quality assurance]]\n* [[Quality control]]\n* [[Quality investing]]\n* [[Quality engineering]]\n* [[Six Sigma]]\n* [[Software quality]]\n* [[Theory of constraints]]\n* [[W.
