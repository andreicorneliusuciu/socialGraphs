It is named after the function [[sine]], of which it is the [[graph of a function|graph]]. It occurs often in pure and applied [[mathematics]], as well as [[physics]], [[engineering]], [[signal processing]] and many other fields.  Its most basic form as a function of time (''t'') is''':'''\n\n:<math>y(t) = A\\sin(2 \\pi f t + \\varphi) = A\\sin(\\omega t + \\varphi)</math>\n\nwhere:\n* ''A'' = the ''[[amplitude]]'', the peak deviation of the function from zero.\n* ''f'' = the ''[[frequency|ordinary frequency]]'', the ''[[Real number|number]]'' of oscillations (cycles) that occur each second of time.\n* ''\u03c9'' = 2\u03c0''f'', the ''[[angular frequency]]'', the rate of change of the function argument in units of [[radian]]s per second\n* ''<math>\\varphi</math>'' = the ''[[Phase (waves)|phase]]'', specifies (in radians) where in its cycle the oscillation is at ''t'' = 0.\n** When ''<math>\\varphi</math>'' is non-zero, the entire waveform appears to be shifted in time by the amount ''<math>\\varphi</math>''/''\u03c9'' seconds.  A negative value represents a delay, and a positive value represents an advance.\n\n{{Listen|filename=220 Hz sine wave.ogg|title=Sine wave|description=2 seconds of a 220 Hz sine wave}}\n[[Image:Animated-mass-spring.gif|right|frame|The oscillation of an undamped spring-mass system around the equilibrium is a sine wave]]\nThe sine wave is important in physics because it retains its wave shape when added to another sine wave of the same frequency and arbitrary phase and magnitude. It is the only periodic waveform that has this property. This property leads to its importance in [[Fourier analysis]] and makes it acoustically unique.\n\n== General form ==\nIn general, the function may also have''':'''\n\n* a spatial variable ''x'' that represents the ''position'' on the dimension on which the wave propagates, and a characteristic parameter ''k'' called [[wave number]] (or angular wave number), which represents the proportionality between the angular frequency &omega; and the linear speed ([[phase velocity|speed of propagation]]) &nu; \n* a non-zero center amplitude, ''D''\n\nwhich is\n\n:<math>y(x,t) = A\\sin(kx -\\omega t + \\varphi ) + D\\,</math>, if the wave is moving to the right\n:<math>y(x,t) = A\\sin(kx + \\omega t + \\varphi ) + D\\,</math>, if the wave is moving to the left\n<ref>Resnick Halliday Walker, Fundamentals of Physics{{full|date=April 2016}}</ref>\nThe wavenumber is related to the angular frequency by''':'''.\n\n:<math> k = { \\omega \\over v } = { 2 \\pi f \\over v } = { 2 \\pi \\over \\lambda }</math>\n\nwhere \u03bb (Lambda) is the [[wavelength]], ''f'' is the [[frequency]], and ''v'' is the linear speed.\n\nThis equation gives a sine wave for a single dimension; thus the generalized equation given above gives the displacement of the wave at a position ''x'' at time ''t'' along a single line.\nThis could, for example, be considered the value of a wave along a wire.\n\nIn two or three spatial dimensions, the same equation describes a travelling [[plane wave]] if position ''x'' and wavenumber ''k'' are interpreted as vectors, and their product as a [[dot product]]. \nFor more complex waves such as the height of a water wave in a pond after a stone has been dropped in, more complex equations are needed.\n\n== Occurrences ==\n[[File:ComplexSinInATimeAxe.gif|thumb|400px|Illustrating the cosine wave's fundamental relationship to the circle.]]\nThis [[wave]] pattern occurs often in nature, including [[ocean surface wave|ocean waves]], [[sound]] waves, and [[light]] waves.\n\nA [[cosine]] wave is said to be \"sinusoidal\", because <math>\\cos(x) = \\sin(x + \\pi/2),</math>\nwhich is also a sine wave with a phase-shift of \u03c0/2 radians. Because of this \"[[head start (positioning)|head start]]\", it is often said that the cosine function ''leads'' the sine function or the sine ''lags'' the cosine.\n\nThe human [[ear]] can recognize single sine waves as sounding clear because sine waves are representations of a single [[frequency]] with no [[harmonics]].\n\nTo the human ear, a sound that is made of more than one sine wave will have perceptible [[harmonics]]; addition of different sine waves results in a different waveform and thus changes the [[timbre]] of the sound. Presence of higher harmonics in addition to the fundamental causes variation in the timbre, which is the reason why the same [[musical note]] (the same frequency) played on different instruments sounds different. On the other hand, if the sound contains aperiodic waves along with sine waves (which are periodic), then the sound will be perceived \"noisy\" as [[Noise (acoustic)|noise]] is characterized as being aperiodic or having a non-repetitive pattern.\n\n== Fourier series ==\n[[File:Waveforms.svg|thumb|400px|Sine, [[square wave|square]], [[triangle wave|triangle]], and [[sawtooth wave|sawtooth]] waveforms]]\n\n{{main|Fourier analysis}}\n\nIn 1822, French mathematician [[Joseph Fourier]] discovered that sinusoidal waves can be used as simple building blocks to describe and approximate any periodic waveform, including [[square wave]]s. Fourier used it as an analytical tool in the study of waves and heat flow. It is frequently used in [[signal processing]] and the statistical analysis of [[time series]].\n\n==Traveling and standing waves==\nSince sine waves propagate without changing form in distributed linear systems, they are often used to analyze [[wave]] propagation.  Sine waves traveling in two directions in space can be represented as\n\n:<math>u(t,x) = A \\sin(kx - \\omega t + \\varphi)</math>\n\nWhen two waves having the same amplitude and frequency, and traveling in opposite directions, [[Superposition principle|superpose]] each other, then a [[standing wave]] pattern is created. Note that, on a plucked string, the interfering waves are the waves reflected from the fixed end points of the string. Therefore, standing waves occur only at certain frequencies, which are referred to as resonant frequencies and are composed of a fundamental frequency and its higher harmonics. The resonant frequencies of a string are determined by the length between the fixed ends and the [[Tension (physics)|tension]] of the string.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Crest (physics)]]\n* [[Fourier transform]]\n* [[Harmonic series (mathematics)]]\n* [[Harmonic series (music)]]\n* [[Helmholtz equation]]\n* [[Instantaneous phase]]\n* [[Pure tone]]\n* [[Simple harmonic motion]]\n* [[Sine]]\n* [[Sinusoidal model]]\n* [[Wave (physics)]]\n* [[Wave equation]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite web |url=https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Sinusoid |work=Encyclopedia of Mathematics |title=Sinusoid |publisher=Springer |accessdate=December 8, 2013}}\n\n[[Category:Trigonometry]]\n[[Category:Wave mechanics]]\n[[Category:Waves]]\n[[Category:Waveforms]]"}]}}}}
