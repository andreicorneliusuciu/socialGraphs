Historically, and still to a significant extent today, they are made from [[terracotta]]. Flowerpots are now often also made from [[plastic]], [[wood]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], or sometimes [[biodegradable]] material. An example of biodegradable pots are ones made of heavy [[kraft paper|brown paper]], [[cardboard]], or [[sphagnum|peat moss]] in which young plants for [[transplanting]] are grown.\n\nFor [[seedling]] starting in commercial [[greenhouse]]s or [[polytunnel]]s, pots usually take the form of trays with cells, each cell acting as one small pot. These trays are often called '''flats'''. \n\nThere are often holes in the bottom of pots, to allow excess [[water]] to flow out, sometimes to a [[saucer]] that is placed under the flowerpot. The plant can use this water with its [[root]]s, as needed. Recently, some flowerpots have been made with an automatic watering system, using a reservoir.\n\n==Flowerpots==\n\nFlowerpots have a number of uses such as transporting plants to new locations, starting seeds, patio and indoor cultivation of plants, and the growing of tender plants in colder regions indoors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ubcbotanicalgarden.org/weblog/000511.php |title=Etaerio - A Plant News Weblog: The History of the Flowerpot |publisher=Ubcbotanicalgarden.org |date=2004-09-07 |accessdate=2010-04-22}}</ref> Through the centuries, the use of flowerpots has influenced the horticultural use of plants, and the [[Egyptians]] were among the first to use pots to move plants from one location to another.  The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] brought potted plants inside during cold weather. In the 18th century, pots were used to ship [[breadfruit]] seedlings from [[Tahiti]] to the [[West Indies]].  Also [[Orchid]]s, [[African violet]]s and ''[[Pelargonium]]'' geraniums were shipped in pots from other parts of the world, including [[Africa]], to [[North America]] and [[Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0818/p14s02-liga.html |title=In praise of the flowerpot / The Christian Science Monitor |publisher=CSMonitor.com |date=2004-08-18 |accessdate=2010-04-22}}</ref>\n\nIn the 18th century, [[Josiah Wedgwood]]'s flowerpots were as popular as his famous dinner-ware, they were often highly decorative and used as table centrepieces.<ref name=\"Life of Josiah Wedgwood\">{{Cite book  | last =  Meteyard | first = Eliza | authorlink = Eliza Meteyard | title = The Life of Josiah Wedgwood: From His Private Correspondence and Family Papers. | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BE8EAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA154& | year = 1866 | publisher = Hurst and Blackett | page = 154 }}</ref>\n\nIn [[Athens]], [[earthenware]] flowerpots were thrown into the sea during the festival of the Gardens of [[Adonis]].

They were made and sold by the cast, which is the number of pots produced from a given quantity of clay.\n\nThe traditional sizes<ref>{{Cite book  | last1 =  Thomas | first1 = H.
