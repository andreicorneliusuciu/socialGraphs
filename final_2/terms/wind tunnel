A wind tunnel consists of a tubular passage with the object under test mounted in the middle. Air is made to move past the object by a powerful fan system or other means. The test object, often called a '''wind tunnel model''', is instrumented with suitable sensors to measure aerodynamic forces, pressure distribution, or other aerodynamic-related characteristics.\n\nThe earliest wind tunnels were invented towards the end of the 19th century, in the early days of aeronautic research,\nwhen many attempted to develop successful heavier-than-air flying machines. The wind tunnel was envisioned as a means of reversing the usual paradigm: instead of the air standing still and an object moving at speed through it, the same effect would be obtained if the object stood still and the air moved at speed past it. In that way a stationary observer could study the flying object in action, and could measure the aerodynamic forces being imposed on it.\n\nThe development of wind tunnels accompanied the development of the airplane. Large wind tunnels were built during the Second World War. Wind tunnel testing was considered of strategic importance during the Cold War development of supersonic aircraft and missiles.\n\nLater on, wind tunnel study came into its own: the effects of wind on man made structures or objects needed to be studied when buildings became tall enough to present large surfaces to the wind, and the resulting forces had to be resisted by the building's internal structure. Determining such forces was required before [[building code]]s could specify the required strength of such buildings and [[Wind engineering|such tests]] continue to be used for large or unusual buildings.\n\nStill later, wind-tunnel testing was applied to [[automobiles]], not so much to determine aerodynamic forces ''per se'' but more to determine ways to reduce the power required to move the vehicle on roadways at a given speed. In these studies, the interaction between the road and the vehicle plays a significant role, and this interaction must be taken into consideration when interpreting the test results. In an actual situation the roadway is moving relative to the vehicle but the air is stationary relative to the roadway, but in the wind tunnel the air is moving relative to the roadway, while the roadway is stationary relative to the test vehicle. Some automotive-test wind tunnels have incorporated moving belts under the test vehicle in an effort to approximate the actual condition, and very similar devices are used in wind tunnel testing of aircraft take-off and landing configurations.\n\nThe advances in [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD) modelling on high speed digital computers has reduced the demand for wind tunnel testing. However, CFD results are still not completely reliable and wind tunnels are used to verify CFD predictions.{{Citation needed|reason=Evidence needed to verify and demonstrate success of wind tunnel testing in the face of failure of CFD.|date=September 2016}}\n\n==Measurement of aerodynamic forces==\nAir velocity and pressures are measured in several ways in wind tunnels.\n\nAir velocity through the test section is determined by [[Bernoulli's principle]].  Measurement of the [[dynamic pressure]], the [[static pressure]], and (for [[compressible flow]] only) the temperature rise in the airflow.\nThe direction of airflow around a model can be determined by tufts of yarn attached to the aerodynamic surfaces. The direction of airflow approaching a surface can be visualized by mounting threads in the airflow ahead of and aft of the test model. Smoke or bubbles of liquid can be introduced into the airflow upstream of the test model, and their path around the model can be photographed (see [[particle image velocimetry]]).\n\nAerodynamic forces on the test model are usually measured with [[beam balance]]s, connected to the test model with beams,strings, or cables.\n\nThe pressure distributions across the test model have historically been measured by drilling many small holes along the airflow path, and using multi-tube [[manometer]]s to measure the pressure at each hole. Pressure distributions can more conveniently be measured by the use of [[pressure-sensitive paint]], in which higher local pressure is indicated by lowered fluorescence of the paint at that point. Pressure distributions can also be conveniently measured by the use of pressure-sensitive [[pressure belt]]s, a recent development in which multiple ultra-miniaturized pressure sensor modules are integrated into a flexible strip. The strip is attached to the aerodynamic surface with tape, and it sends signals depicting the pressure distribution along its surface.<ref>''Going with the flow'', Aerospace Engineering & Manufacturing, March 2009, pp. 27-28 [[Society of Automotive Engineers]]</ref>\n\nPressure distributions on a test model can also be determined by performing a '''wake survey''', in which either a single [[pitot tube]] is used to obtain multiple readings downstream of the test model, or a multiple-tube manometer is mounted downstream and all its readings are taken.\n\nThe aerodynamic properties of an object can not all remain the same for a scaled model.<ref name=\"Lissaman\">{{cite journal|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.fl.15.010183.001255|title=Low-Reynolds-Number Airfoils|first=P.

The choice of similarity parameters depends on the purpose of the test, but the most important conditions to satisfy are usually:\n\n* Geometric similarity: all dimensions of the object must be proportionally scaled;\n* [[Mach number]]: the ratio of the airspeed to the speed of sound should be identical for the scaled model and the actual object (having identical [[Mach number]] in a wind tunnel and around the actual object is -not- equal to having identical airspeeds) \n* [[Reynolds number]]: the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces should be kept. This parameter is difficult to satisfy with a scaled model and has led to development of pressurized and cryogenic wind tunnels in which the viscosity of the working fluid can be greatly changed to compensate for the reduced scale of the model.\n\nIn certain particular test cases, other similarity parameters must be satisfied, such as e.g. [[Froude number]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nEnglish military engineer and mathematician [[Benjamin Robins]] (1707&ndash;1751) invented a [[whirling arm]] apparatus to determine drag<ref>James Wilson, ed., ''Mathematical Tracts of the late Benjamin Robins, Esq;'' \u2026 (London, England:  J. Nourse, 1761), vol. 1, \"An account of the experiments, relating to the resistance of the air, exhibited at different times before the Royal Society, in the year 1746.\" ; see [https://books.google.com/books?id=ha82AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA202#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 202-203.]</ref> and did some of the first experiments in aviation theory.\n\n[[Sir George Cayley]] (1773\u20131857) also used a whirling arm to measure the drag and lift of various airfoils.<ref>J. A. D. Ackroyd (2011) \"Sir George Cayley: The Invention of the Aeroplane near Scarborough at the Time of Trafalgar,\" ''Journal of Aeronautical History'', '''1''' : 130\u2013181 ; see pp. 147-149 and 166.

Centrifugal forces and the fact that the object is moving in its own wake mean that detailed examination of the airflow is difficult. [[Francis Herbert Wenham]] (1824\u20131908), a Council Member of the [[Aeronautical Society of Great Britain]], addressed these issues by inventing, designing and operating the first enclosed wind tunnel in 1871.<ref>Note:\n*  That Wenham and Browning were attempting to build a wind tunnel is briefly mentioned in:  ''Sixth Annual Report of the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain for the Year 1871'', p. 6.  [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b4513625;view=1up;seq=444 From p. 6:]  \"For this purpose [viz, accumulating experimental knowledge about the effects of wind pressure], the Society itself, through Mr. Wenham, had directed a machine to be constructed by Mr. Browning, who, he was sure, would take great interest in the work, and would give to it all the time and attention required.\"\n*  In 1872, the wind tunnel was demonstrated to the Aeronautical Society.  See:  ''Seventh Annual Report of the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain for the Year 1872'', [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b4513626;view=1up;seq=10 pp. 6-12.]</ref> Once this breakthrough had been achieved, detailed technical data was rapidly extracted by the use of this tool. Wenham and his colleague John Browning are credited with many fundamental discoveries, including the measurement of l/d ratios, and the revelation of the beneficial effects of a high [[Aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]].\n\n[[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] built an open-section wind tunnel with a centrifugal blower in 1897, and determined the drag coefficients of flat plates, cylinders and spheres.\n\nDanish inventor [[Poul la Cour]] applied wind tunnels in his process of developing and refining the technology of [[wind turbine]]s in the early 1890s.\n\n[[Carl Rickard Nyberg]] used a wind tunnel when designing his ''[[Flugan]]'' from 1897 and onwards.\n\nIn a classic set of experiments, the Englishman [[Osborne Reynolds]] (1842\u20131912) of the [[University of Manchester]] demonstrated that the airflow pattern over a scale model would be the same for the full-scale vehicle if a certain flow parameter were the same in both cases. This factor, now known as the [[Reynolds number]], is a basic parameter in the description of all fluid-flow situations, including the shapes of flow patterns, the ease of heat transfer, and the onset of turbulence. This comprises the central scientific justification for the use of models in wind tunnels to simulate real-life phenomena. However, there are limitations on conditions in which [[Dynamic similarity (Reynolds and Womersley numbers)|dynamic similarity]] is based upon the Reynolds number alone.\n[[File:WB Wind Tunnel.jpg|thumb|Replica of the Wright brothers' wind tunnel.]]\n[[File:Windtunnel2.JPG|thumb|Eiffel's wind tunnels in the Auteuil laboratory]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-17158, Deutsche Versuchsanstalt f\u00fcr Luftfahrt.jpg||right|thumb|250px|German aviation laboratory, 1935]]\n\nThe [[Wright brothers]]' use of a simple wind tunnel in 1901 to study the effects of airflow over various shapes while developing their [[Wright Flyer]] was in some ways revolutionary.<ref name=Dodson>{{cite journal |author=Dodson, MG |title=An Historical and Applied Aerodynamic Study of the Wright Brothers' Wind Tunnel Test Program and Application to Successful Manned Flight |journal=[[United States Naval Academy|US Naval Academy]] Technical Report |volume=USNA-334 |year=2005 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/3585 |accessdate=2009-03-11}}</ref> It can be seen from the above, however, that they were simply using the accepted technology of the day, though this was not yet a common technology in America.\n\nIn [[France]], [[Gustave Eiffel]] (1832-1923) built his first open-return wind tunnel in 1909, powered by a 50&nbsp;kW electric motor, at Champs-de-Mars, near the foot of the tower that bears his name. \nBetween 1909 and 1912 Eiffel ran about 4000 tests in his wind tunnel, and his systematic experimentation set new standards for aeronautical research.\nIn 1912 Eiffel's laboratory was moved to Auteuil, a suburb of Paris, where his wind tunnel with a 2-metre test section is still operational today. Eiffel significantly improved the efficiency of the open-return wind tunnel by enclosing the test section in a chamber, designing a flared inlet with a honeycomb flow straightener and adding a diffuser between the test section and the fan located at the downstream end of the diffuser; this was an arrangement followed by a number of wind tunnels later built; in fact the open-return low speed wind tunnel is often called the Eiffel-type wind tunnel.\n\nSubsequent use of wind tunnels proliferated as the science of aerodynamics and discipline of aeronautical engineering were established and air travel and power were developed.\n\nThe US Navy in 1916 built one of the largest wind tunnels in the world at that time at the Washington Navy Yard. The inlet was almost {{convert|11|ft|m}} in diameter and the discharge part was {{convert|7|ft|m}} in diameter. A 500&nbsp;hp electric motor drove the paddle type fan blades.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=V3fmAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA426&dq=Aero+Club+Of+America+Flying&hl=en&ei=XbQqTeyqCdv4nwex5pHXAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=Aero%20Club%20Of%20America%20Flying&f=true \"US Navy Experimental Wind Tunnel\"] ''Aerial Age Weekly'', 17 January 1916, pages 426-427</ref>\n\nIn 1931 the NACA built a 30-foot by 60-foot \"full scale\" wind tunnel at Langley Research Center in Langley, Virginia. The tunnel was powered by a pair of fans driven by 4000&nbsp;hp electric motors. The layout was a double-return, closed-loop format and could accommodate many full-size real aircraft as well as scale models. The tunnel was eventually closed and, even though it was declared a historic national landmark in 1995, demolition began in 2010.\n\nUntil World War Two, the world's largest wind tunnel was built in 1932-1934 and located in a suburb of Paris, Chalais-Meudon, France.  It was designed to test full size aircraft and had six large fans driven by high powered electric motors.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=QdsDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA94&dq=Popular+Science+1935+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&hl=en&ei=QIs_TpjpHOPJsQKo4uC_Bw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCwQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Man Made Hurricane Tests Full Size Planes\" ''Popular Mechanics'', January 1936, pp.94-95]</ref> The Chalais Meudon wind tunnel was used by [[ONERA]] under the name S1Ch until 1976, e.g. in the development of the [[Sud Aviation Caravelle|Caravelle]] and [[Concorde]] airplanes.

It used some large natural caves which were increased in size by excavation and then sealed to store large volumes of air which could then be routed through the wind tunnels. This innovative approach allowed lab research in high-speed regimes and greatly accelerated the rate of advance of Germany's aeronautical engineering efforts. By the end of the war, Germany had at least three different ''supersonic'' wind tunnels, with one capable of Mach 4.4 (heated) airflows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.co.uk/DataBank/VideoGallery/VideoPlayer/tabid/384/VideoId/33/Test-Pilot-Discussion.aspx |title=Video Player > Test Pilot discussion |publisher=Space.co.uk |accessdate=2011-06-28}}</ref>\n\nA large wind tunnel under construction near [[Oetztal]], Austria would have had two fans directly driven by two 50,000 horsepower [[hydropower|hydraulic turbines]].

Metal pressure chambers were used to store high-pressure air which was then accelerated through a [[de Laval nozzle|nozzle]] designed to provide supersonic flow. The observation or instrumentation chamber (\"test section\") was then placed at the proper location in the throat or nozzle for the desired airspeed.\n\nIn the United States, concern over the lagging of American research facilities compared to those built by the Germans lead to the [[Unitary Wind Tunnel Plan Act]] of 1949, which authorized expenditure to construct new wind tunnels at universities and at military sites. Some German war-time wind tunnels were dismantled for shipment to the United States as part of the plan to exploit German technology developments.<ref name=Hiebert02>{{cite web|url=http://www.arnold.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-120305-099.pdf |format=PDF|first=DAVID M. |last=HIEBERT|title=PUBLIC LAW 81-415: THE UNITARY WIND TUNNEL PLAN ACT OF 1949 AND THE AIR ENGINEERING DEVELOPMENT CENTER ACT OF 19491|year= 2002|accessdate=2014-04-03}}</ref>\n\nFor limited applications, [[Computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD) can supplement or possibly replace the use of wind tunnels. For example, the experimental [[rocket plane]] [[SpaceShipOne]] was designed without any use of wind tunnels. However, on one test, flight threads were attached to the surface of the wings, performing a wind tunnel type of test during an actual flight in order to refine the computational model. Where external [[turbulent]] flow is present, CFD is not practical due to limitations in present-day computing resources. For example, an area that is still much too complex for the use of CFD is determining the effects of flow on and around structures, bridges, terrain, etc.\n\n[[File:Kirsten wind tunnel 05.jpg|thumb|left|Preparing a model in the Kirsten Wind Tunnel, a subsonic wind tunnel at the [[University of Washington]]]]\nThe most effective way to simulative external turbulent flow is through the use of a boundary layer wind tunnel.\n\nThere are many applications for boundary layer wind tunnel modeling. For example, understanding the impact of wind on high-rise buildings, factories, bridges, etc. can help building designers construct a structure that stands up to wind effects in the most efficient manner possible. Another significant application for boundary layer wind tunnel modeling is for understanding exhaust gas dispersion patterns for hospitals, laboratories, and other emitting sources. Other examples of boundary layer wind tunnel applications are assessments of pedestrian comfort and snow drifting. Wind tunnel modeling is accepted as a method for aiding in [[Green building]] design. For instance, the use of boundary layer wind tunnel modeling can be used as a credit for [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) certification through the U.S. Green Building Council.\n\n[[File:Man examining fan of Langley Research Center 16 foot transonic wind tunnel.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Fan blades of [[Langley Research Center]]'s 16 foot [[transonic]] wind tunnel in 1990, before it was [[wikt:mothball|mothballed]] in 2004.]]\n\nWind tunnel tests in a boundary layer wind tunnel allow for the natural drag of the Earth's surface to be simulated. For accuracy, it is important to simulate the mean wind speed profile and turbulence effects within the atmospheric boundary layer. Most codes and standards recognize that wind tunnel testing can produce reliable information for designers, especially when their projects are in complex terrain or on exposed sites.\n\nIn the USA many wind tunnels have been decommissioned in the last 20 years, including some historic facilities. Pressure is brought to bear on remaining wind tunnels due to declining or erratic usage, high electricity costs, and in some cases the high value of the real estate upon which the facility sits. On the other hand, CFD validation still requires wind-tunnel data, and this is likely to be the case for the foreseeable future. Studies have been done and others are under way to assess future military and commercial wind tunnel needs, but the outcome remains uncertain.<ref>Goldstein, E., \"Wind Tunnels, Don't Count Them Out,\" ''Aerospace America'', Vol. 48 #4, April 2010, pp. 38-43</ref> More recently an increasing use of jet-powered, instrumented unmanned vehicles [\"research drones\"] have replaced some of the traditional uses of wind tunnels.<ref>Benjamin Gal-Or, \"Vectored Propulsion, Supermaneuverability & Robot Aircraft\", Springer Verlag, 1990, ISBN 0-387-97161-0, ISBN 3-540-97161-0</ref>\n\n==How it works==\n[[File:Kirsten wind tunnel 08A.jpg|thumb|left|Six-element external balance below the Kirsten Wind Tunnel]]\nAir is blown or sucked through a duct equipped with a viewing port and instrumentation where [[Physical model|models]] or geometrical shapes are mounted for study. Typically the air is moved through the tunnel using a series of fans. For very large wind tunnels several meters in diameter, a single large fan is not practical, and so instead an array of multiple fans are used in parallel to provide sufficient airflow. Due to the sheer volume and speed of air movement required, the fans may be powered by stationary [[turbofan]] engines rather than electric motors.\n\nThe airflow created by the fans that is entering the tunnel is itself highly turbulent due to the fan blade motion (when the fan is '''blowing''' air into the test section \u2013 when it is '''sucking''' air out of the test section downstream, the fan-blade turbulence is not a factor), and so is not directly useful for accurate measurements. The air moving through the tunnel needs to be relatively turbulence-free and [[wikt:laminar|laminar]]. To correct this problem, closely spaced vertical and horizontal air vanes are used to smooth out the turbulent airflow before reaching the subject of the testing.\n\nDue to the effects of [[viscosity]], the cross-section of a wind tunnel is typically circular rather than square, because there will be greater flow constriction in the corners of a square tunnel that can make the flow turbulent. A circular tunnel provides a smoother flow.\n\nThe inside facing of the tunnel is typically as smooth as possible, to reduce surface drag and turbulence that could impact the accuracy of the testing. Even smooth walls induce some drag into the airflow, and so the object being tested is usually kept near the center of the tunnel, with an empty buffer zone between the object and the tunnel walls. There are correction factors to relate wind tunnel test results to open-air results.\n\nThe lighting is usually embedded into the circular walls of the tunnel and shines in through windows. If the light were mounted on the inside surface of the tunnel in a conventional manner, the light bulb would generate turbulence as the air blows around it. Similarly, observation is usually done through transparent portholes into the tunnel. Rather than simply being flat discs, these lighting and observation windows may be curved to match the cross-section of the tunnel and further reduce turbulence around the window.\n\nVarious techniques are used to study the actual airflow around the geometry and compare it with theoretical results, which must also take into account the [[Reynolds number]] and [[Mach number]] for the regime of operation.\n\n===Pressure measurements===\nPressure across the surfaces of the model can be measured if the model includes pressure taps. This can be useful for pressure-dominated phenomena, but this only accounts for normal forces on the body.\n\n===Force and moment measurements===\n[[File:Lift curve.svg|thumb|A typical [[lift coefficient]] versus [[angle of attack]] curve.]]\n\nWith the model mounted on a [[Beam Balance|force balance]], one can measure lift, drag, lateral forces, yaw, roll, and pitching moments over a range of [[angle of attack]]. This allows one to produce common curves such as [[lift coefficient]] versus angle of attack (shown).\n\nNote that the force balance itself creates drag and potential turbulence that will affect the model and introduce errors into the measurements. The supporting structures are therefore typically smoothly shaped to minimize turbulence.\n\n==Flow visualization==\nBecause air is transparent it is difficult to directly observe the air movement itself. Instead, multiple methods of both quantitative and qualitative flow visualization methods have been developed for testing in a wind tunnel.\n\n===Qualitative methods===\n\n*Smoke\n*Tufts\nTufts are applied to a model and remain attached during testing. Tufts can be used to gauge air flow patterns and flow separation.\n\n[[File:GIF Flow visualization.gif|thumb|right|upright=3|Compilation of images taken during an alpha run starting at 0 degrees alpha ranging to 26 degrees alpha.

Angle of attack ~ 12 degrees, speed ~120 Mph.]]\n\n*Evaporating suspensions\nEvaporating suspensions are simply a mixture of some sort or fine powder, talc, or clay mixed into a liquid with a low latent heat of evaporation. When the wind is turned on the liquid quickly evaporates leaving behind the clay in a pattern characteristic of the air flow.\n\n[[File:Wing air flow pattern.jpg|thumb|none|upright=2|China clay on a wing in the Kirsten Wind Tunnel showing reverse and span-wise flow.]]\n\n*Oil\nWhen oil is applied to the model surface it can clearly show the transition from laminar to turbulent flow as well as flow separation.\n\n[[File:Oil flow vis on straight wing.jpg|thumb|none|Oil flow visible on a straight wing in the Kirsten Wind Tunnel. Trip dots can be seen near the leading edge.]]\n\n*Fog\nFog (usually from water particles) is created with an [[ultrasonics|ultrasonic]] [[piezoelectric]] [[nebulizer]]. The fog is transported inside the wind tunnel (preferably of the closed circuit & closed test section type). An electrically heated grid is inserted before the test section which evaporates the water particles at its vicinity thus forming fog sheets. The fog sheets function as streamlines over the test model when illuminated by a light sheet.\n[[File:Fog visualization.jpg|thumb|Fog (water particle) wind tunnel visualization of a NACA 4412 airfoil at a low-speed flow (Re=20.000).]]\n\n[http://vimeo.com/24212774 Video of a wind tunnel fog visualization]\n\n*Sublimation\n\nIf the air movement in the tunnel is sufficiently non-turbulent, a particle stream released into the airflow will not break up as the air moves along, but stay together as a sharp thin line. Multiple particle streams released from a grid of many nozzles can provide a dynamic three-dimensional shape of the airflow around a body. As with the force balance, these injection pipes and nozzles need to be shaped in a manner that minimizes the introduction of turbulent airflow into the airstream.\n\nHigh-speed turbulence and vortices can be difficult to see directly, but [[strobe lights]] and film cameras or high-speed digital cameras can help to capture events that are a blur to the naked eye.\n\nHigh-speed cameras are also required when the subject of the test is itself moving at high speed, such as an airplane propeller. The camera can capture [[strobe lights|stop-motion]] images of how the blade cuts through the particulate streams and how vortices are generated along the trailing edges of the moving blade.\n\n==Classification==\nThere are many different kinds of wind tunnels, an overview is given in the list below:\n\n* [[Subsonic and transonic wind tunnel#Subsonic tunnel|Low-speed wind tunnel]]\n* [[High speed wind tunnel|High-speed wind tunnel]]\n* [[Supersonic wind tunnel]]\n* [[Hypersonic wind tunnel]]\n* [[Subsonic and transonic wind tunnel]]\n \nWind tunnels are also classified based on their main use.\n\n===Aeronautical wind tunnels===\nThe main subcategories in the aeronautical wind tunnels are\n\n====High Reynolds number tunnels====\n[[Reynolds number]] is one of the governing similarity parameters for the simulation of flow in a wind tunnel. For [[mach number]] less than 0.3, it is the primary parameter that governs the flow characteristics. There are three main ways to simulate high Reynolds number, since it is not practical to obtain full scale Reynolds number by use of a full scale vehicle.\n*Pressurised tunnels - Here test gases are pressurised to increase the Reynolds number.\n*Heavy gas tunnels - Heavier gases like [[freon]] and [[R-134a]] are used as test gases. The transonic dynamics tunnel at [[NASA]] Langley is an example of such a tunnel.\n*Cryogenic tunnels - Here test gas is cooled down to increase the Reynolds number. The [[European transonic wind tunnel]] uses this technique.\n*High-Altitude Tunnels - These are designed to test the effects of shock waves against various aircraft shapes in near vacuum.  In 1952 the University of California constructed the first two high-altitude wind tunnels. One for testing objects at 50 to 70 miles above earth and the second one for tests at 80 to 200 miles above earth.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8dwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA105&dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&hl=en&sa=X&ei=lYK0T7T1Es2dgQe5iMgH&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAjgy#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Windless Wind Tunnels for High Altitude Tests.\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', February 1952, p. 105.</ref>\n\n====V/STOL tunnels====\n[[V/STOL]] tunnels require large cross section area, but only small velocities. Since power varies with the cube of velocity, the power required for the operation is also less. An example for a V/STOL tunnel is the [[NASA]] Langley 14' X 22'tunnel.<ref>[http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/atp/facilities/14x22/index.html 14'x22' Subsonic Wind Tunnel]. Aeronautics.nasa.gov (2008-04-18). Retrieved on 2014-06-16.</ref>\n\n====Spin tunnels====\nAircraft have a tendency to go to spin when they [[stall (flight)|stall]]. These tunnels are used to study that phenomenon.\n\n===Automotive tunnels===\nAutomotive wind tunnels fall into two categories:\n*external flow tunnels - Used to study the external flow through the chassis\n*climatic tunnels - Used to evaluate the performance of door systems, braking systems etc. under various climatic conditions. Most of the leading automobile manufacturers have their own climatic wind tunnels\n\n[[Wunibald Kamm]] \"built the first full-scale wind tunnel for motor vehicles.\"<ref name=\"kraftfahrwesen\">{{cite web|title=History (1930-1945)|url=http://www.fkfs.de/english/company/history/|publisher=Forschungsinstitut f\u00fcr Kraftfahrwesen und Fahrzeugmotoren Stuttgart|accessdate=3 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nFor external flow tunnels various systems are used to compensate for  the effect of the boundary layer on the road surface, including systems of moving belts under each wheel and the body of the car (5 or 7 belt systems) or one large belt under the entire car, or other methods of boundary layer control such as scoops or perforations to suck it away.<ref>http://www.dnw.aero/skills-and-specialities/simulation-techniques/ground-simulation.aspx</ref>\n\n===Aeroacoustic tunnels===\nThese tunnels are used in the studies of noise generated  by flow and its suppression.\n\n[[File:Vertical wind tunnel at TsAGI.jpg|right|thumb|Vertical wind tunnel T-105 at [[TsAGI|Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute]], Moscow, built in 1941 for aircraft testing ]]\n\n===Aquadynamic flume===\nThe aerodynamic principles of the wind tunnel work equally on watercraft, except the water is more viscous and so sets greater forces on the object being tested. A looping [[flume]] is typically used for underwater aquadynamic testing. The interaction between 2 different types of fluids means that pure windtunnel testing is only partly relevant. However, a similar sort of research is done in a towing tank.\n\n===Low-speed oversize liquid testing===\nAir is not always the best test medium to study small-scale aerodynamic principles, due to the speed of the air flow and airfoil movement. A study of fruit fly wings designed to understand how the wings produce lift was performed using a large tank of mineral oil and wings 100 times larger than actual size, in order to slow down the wing beats and make the [[vortices]] generated by the insect wings easier to see and understand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carlzimmer.com/articles/2002/articles_2002_Flyorama.html |title='&#39;Popular Science, Dec 2002'&#39; |publisher=Carlzimmer.com |accessdate=2011-06-28}}</ref>\n\n===Fan testing===\n\nWind tunnel tests are also performed to precisely measure the air movement of fans at a specific pressure. By determining the environmental circumstances during measurement, and by revising the air-tightness afterwards, the standardization of the data is ensured.\n\nThere are two possible ways of measurement: a complete fan, or an [[impeller]] on a hydraulic installation. Two measuring tubes enable measurements of lower air currents (< 30.000 m\u00b3/h) as well as higher air currents (< 60.000 m\u00b3/h). The determination of the Q/h curve of the [[Mechanical fan|fan]] is one of the main objectives. To determine this curve (and to define other parameters) air technical, mechanical as well as electro technical data are measured:\n\nAir technical:\n* Static pressure difference (Pa)\n* Amount of moved air (m\u00b3/h)\n* Average air speed (m/s)\n* Specific efficiency (W/1000m\u00b3/h)\n* Efficiency\n\nElectro technical:\n* Tension (V)\n* Current (A)\n* Cos \u03c6\n* Admitted power (W) fan / [[impeller]]\n* Rotations per minute (RPM)\n\nThe measurement can take place on the fan or in the application in which the fan is used.\n\n===Wind engineering testing===\nIn [[Wind Engineering]], wind tunnel tests are used to measure the velocity around, and forces or pressures upon structures. Very tall buildings, buildings with unusual or complicated shapes (such as a tall building with a parabolic or a hyperbolic shape), cable suspension bridges or cable stayed bridges are analyzed in specialized atmospheric boundary layer wind tunnels. These feature a long upwind section to accurately represent the wind speed and turbulence profile acting on the structure. Wind tunnel tests provide the necessary design pressure measurements in use of the dynamic analysis and control of tall buildings.<ref>{{cite journal|last=ALY|first=Aly Mousaad |author2=Alberto Zasso |author3=Ferruccio Resta|title=Dynamics and Control of High-Rise Buildings under Multidirectional Wind Loads|journal=Smart Materials Research|year=2011|url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/smr/2011/549621/ }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=ALY|first=Aly Mousaad |author2=Alberto Zasso |author3=Ferruccio Resta|title=On the dynamics of a very slender building under winds: response reduction using MR dampers with lever mechanism|journal=The Structural Design of Tall and Special Buildings|year=2011|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tal.647/abstract|doi=10.1002/tal.647}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Arsenal (Vienna)]], climatic wind tunnel centre used by the rail industry\n* [[Automobile design]]\n* [[Doriot Climatic Chambers]], climatic wind tunnel centre operated by the United States military\n* [[Sting (fixture)]]\n* [[Vertical wind tunnel]], a recreational device simulating sky-diving\n* [[Water tunnel (hydrodynamic)|Water tunnel]], the hydrodynamics-oriented version of a wind tunnel.\n* [[List of Wind Tunnels]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n*Jewel B.
