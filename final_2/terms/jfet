They are three-terminal [[semiconductor]] devices that can be used as [[electronics|electronically]]-controlled [[switch]]es, amplifiers, or voltage-controlled [[Electrical resistance|resistors]]. \n\nUnlike bipolar transistors, JFETs are exclusively voltage-controlled in that they do not need a [[biasing]] current. [[Electric charge]] flows through a semiconducting channel between ''source'' and ''drain'' terminals.  By applying a reverse bias [[voltage]] to a ''gate'' terminal, the channel is \"pinched\", so that the [[electric current]] is impeded or switched off completely. A JFET is usually on when there is no potential difference between its gate and source terminals. If a potential difference of the proper polarity is applied between its gate and source terminals, the JFET will be more resistive to current flow, which means less current would flow in the channel between the source and drain terminals. Thus, JFETs are sometimes referred to as [[depletion-mode]] devices. \n\nJFETs can have an [[n-type semiconductor|n-type]] or [[p-type semiconductor|p-type]] channel.  In the n-type, if the voltage applied to the gate is less than that applied to the source, the current will be reduced (similarly in the p-type, if the voltage applied to the gate is ''greater'' than that applied to the source). A JFET has a large input impedance (sometimes on the order of 10<sup>10</sup> ohms), which means that it has a negligible effect on external components or circuits connected to its gate.\n\n== History ==\nA succession of FET-like devices were patented by [[Julius Edgar Lilienfeld|Julius Lilienfeld]] in the 1920s and 1930s.However, materials science and fabrication technology would require decades of advances before FETs could actually be made.  In 1947, researchers [[John Bardeen]], [[Walter Houser Brattain]], and [[William Shockley]] failed in their repeated attempts to make a FET. They discovered the [[point-contact transistor]] in the course of trying to diagnose the reasons for their failures. The first practical JFETs were made a decade later.\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe JFET is a long channel of [[semiconductor]] material, [[doping (semiconductor)|doped]] to contain an abundance of positive [[electric charge|charge]] carriers or [[Electron hole|holes]] (''p-type''), or of negative carriers or [[electron]]s (''n-type''). [[Ohmic contact]]s at each end form the source (S) and the drain (D). A [[P-N junction|pn-junction]] is formed on one or both sides of the channel, or surrounding it, using a region with doping opposite to that of the channel, and biased using an ohmic gate contact (G).\n\n== Function ==\n\n[[Image:JFET n-channel en.svg|thumb|280px|I\u2013V characteristics and output plot of an n-channel JFET]]\n\nJFET operation can be compared to that of a [[garden hose]]. The flow of water through a hose can be controlled by squeezing it to reduce the [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]] and the flow of [[electric charge]] through a JFET is controlled by constricting the current-carrying channel. The current also depends on the electric field between source and drain (analogous to the difference in [[Fluid pressure|pressure]] on either end of the hose).\n\nConstriction of the conducting channel is accomplished using the [[Field effect (semiconductor)|field effect]]: a voltage between the gate and the source is applied to reverse bias the gate-source pn-junction, thereby widening the [[depletion layer]] of this junction (see top figure), encroaching upon the conducting channel and restricting its cross-sectional area. The depletion layer is so-called because it is depleted of mobile carriers and so is electrically non-conducting for practical purposes.<ref name=JFET> For a discussion of JFET structure and operation, see for example {{cite book |title=Electronics (fundamentals and applications) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n0rf9_2ckeYC&pg=PA269 |chapter=\u00a713.2 Junction field-effect transistor (JFET) |author=D. Chattopadhyay |isbn=8122417809 |publisher=New Age International |pages=269 ''ff'' |year=2006}}</ref>\n\nWhen the depletion layer spans the width of the conduction channel, ''pinch-off'' is achieved and drain-to-source conduction stops. Pinch-off occurs at a particular reverse bias (V<sub>GS</sub>) of the gate-source junction. The pinch-off voltage (V<sub>p</sub>) varies considerably, even among devices of the same type. For example, V<sub>GS(off)</sub> for the Temic J202 device varies from {{nowrap|\u22120.8 V}} to {{nowrap|\u22124 V}}.<ref>[http://docs-europe.origin.electrocomponents.com/webdocs/0027/0900766b80027bd1.pdf J201 data sheet]</ref> Typical values vary from {{nowrap|\u22120.3 V}} to {{nowrap|\u221210 V}}.\n\nTo switch off an '''n'''-channel device requires a '''n'''egative gate-source voltage (V<sub>GS</sub>). Conversely, to switch off a '''p'''-channel device requires '''p'''ositive V<sub>GS</sub>.\n\nIn normal operation, the electric field developed by the gate blocks source-drain conduction to some extent.\n\nSome JFET devices are symmetrical with respect to the source and drain.\n\n== Schematic symbols ==\n[[Image:JFET N-dep symbol.svg|thumb|100px|[[electronic symbol|Circuit symbol]] for an n-Channel JFET]]\n[[Image:JFET P-dep symbol.svg|thumb|100px|Circuit symbol for a p-Channel JFET]]\n\nThe JFET gate is sometimes drawn in the middle of the channel (instead of at the drain or source electrode as in these examples). This symmetry suggests that \"drain\" and \"source\" are interchangeable, so the symbol should be used only for those JFETs where they are indeed interchangeable.\n\nOfficially, the style of the symbol should show the component inside a circle (representing the envelope of a discrete device). This is true in both the US and Europe. The symbol is usually drawn without the circle when drawing schematics of integrated circuits. More recently, the symbol is often drawn without its circle even for discrete devices.\n\nIn every case the arrow head shows the polarity of the P-N junction formed between the channel and the gate. As with an ordinary [[diode]], the arrow points from P to N, the direction of [[Electric current#Conventional current|conventional current]] when forward-biased. An English [[mnemonic]] is that the arrow of an N-channel device \"points i'''n'''\".\n\n== Comparison with other transistors ==\nAt room temperature, JFET gate current (the reverse leakage of the gate-to-channel [[P-n junction|junction]]) is comparable to that of a [[MOSFET]] (which has insulating oxide between gate and channel), but much less than the base current of a [[bipolar junction transistor]].  The JFET has higher gain ([[transconductance]]) than the MOSFET, as well as lower [[flicker noise]], and is therefore used in some low-[[Noise (physics)|noise]], high input-impedance [[Operational amplifier|op-amps]].\n\n==Mathematical model==\nThe current in N-JFET due to a small voltage V<sub>DS</sub> (that is, in the linear ohmic region) is given by treating the channel as a rectangular bar of material of [[electrical conductivity]] <math>q N_d \\mu_n</math>:<ref name=kumar>{{cite book|author=Balbir Kumar and Shail B.
