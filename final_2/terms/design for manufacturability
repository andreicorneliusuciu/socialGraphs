The concept exists in almost all engineering disciplines, but the implementation differs widely depending on the manufacturing technology. DFM describes the process of designing or engineering a product in order to facilitate the [[manufacturing]] process in order to reduce its manufacturing costs.  DFM will allow potential problems to be fixed in the design phase which is the least expensive place to address them. Other factors may affect the manufacturability such as the type of raw material, the form of the raw material, dimensional tolerances, and secondary processing such as finishing.\n\nDepending on various types of manufacturing processes there are set guidelines for DFM practices. These DFM guidelines help to precisely define various tolerances, rules and common manufacturing checks related to DFM.\n\nWhile DFM is applicable to the design process, a similar concept called [[DFSS]] (Design for Six Sigma) is also practiced in many organizations.\n\n==Design for manufacturability for printed circuit boards (PCB)==\n\nIn the [[Printed circuit board|PCB]] design process, DFM leads to a set of design guidelines that attempt to ensure manufacturability. By doing so, probable production problems may be addressed during the design stage.\n\nIdeally, DFM guidelines take into account the processes and capabilities of the manufacturing industry. Therefore, DFM is constantly evolving.\n\nAs manufacturing companies evolve and automate more and more stages of the processes, these processes tend to become cheaper. DFM is usually used to reduce these costs. For example, if a process may be done automatically by machines (i.e. [[Surface-mount technology|SMT]] component placement and soldering), such process is likely to be cheaper than doing so by hand.\n\n==Design for manufacturability for integrated circuits (IC)==\nAchieving high-yielding designs, in the state of the art [[Very-large-scale integration|VLSI]] technology has become an extremely challenging task due to the miniaturization as well as the complexity of leading-edge products. Here, the DFM methodology includes a set of techniques to modify the design of [[integrated circuit]]s (IC) in order to make them more manufacturable, i.e., to improve their functional yield, parametric yield, or their reliability.\n\n===Background===\nTraditionally, in the prenanometer era, DFM consisted of a set of different methodologies trying to enforce some soft (recommended) design rules regarding the shapes and polygons of the [[Integrated circuit layout|physical layout of an integrated circuit]]. These DFM methodologies worked primarily at the full chip level.  Additionally, worst-case simulations at different levels of abstraction were applied to minimize the impact of process variations on performance and other types of parametric yield loss. All these different types of worst-case simulations were essentially based on a base set of worst-case (or corner) [[SPICE]] device parameter files that were intended to represent the variability of transistor performance over the full range of variation in a fabrication process.\n\n=== Taxonomy of yield loss mechanisms ===\nThe most important yield loss models (YLMs) for VLSI ICs can be classified into several categories based on their nature.\n*'''Functional yield loss''' is still the dominant factor and is caused by mechanisms such as misprocessing (e.g., equipment-related problems), systematic effects such as printability or planarization problems, and purely random defects.\n*High-performance products may exhibit '''parametric design marginalities''' caused by either process fluctuations or environmental factors (such as supply voltage or temperature).\n*The '''test-related yield losses''', which are caused by incorrect testing, can also play a significant role.\n\n===Techniques===\nAfter understanding the causes of yield loss, the next step is to make the design as resistant as possible.  Techniques used for this include:\n*Substituting higher yield cells where permitted by timing, power, and routability.\n*Changing the spacing and width of the interconnect wires, where possible\n*Optimizing the amount of redundancy in internal memories.\n*Substituting fault tolerant (redundant) vias in a design where possible\nAll of these require a detailed understanding of yield loss mechanisms, since these changes trade off against one another.  For example, introducing redundant [[Via (electronics)|vias]] will reduce the chance of via problems, but increase the chance of unwanted shorts.  Whether this is good idea, therefore, depends on the details of the yield loss models and the characteristics of the particular design.\n\n==Design for manufacturability for CNC machining==\n===Objective===\nThe objective is to design for lower cost. The cost is driven by time, so the design must minimize the time required to not just machine (remove the material), but also the set-up time of the CNC machine, NC programming, fixturing  and many other activities that are dependent on the complexity and size of the part.\n===Set-Up Time of Operations (Flip of the Part)===\nUnless a 5th-Axis is used, a CNC can only approach the part from a single direction.  One side must be machined at a time (called an operation or Op). Then the part must be flipped from side to side to machine all of the features.  The geometry of the features dictates whether the part must be flipped over or not. The more Ops (flip of the part), the more expensive the part because it incurs substantial \u201cSet-up\u201d and \u201cLoad/Unload\u201d time.\n\nEach operation (flip of the part) has set-up time, machine time, time to load/unload tools, time to load/unload parts, and time to create the NC program for each operation. If a part has only 1 operation, then parts only have to be loaded/unloaded once.  If it has 5 operations, then load/unload time is significant.\n\nThe low hanging fruit is minimizing the number of operations (flip of the part) to create significant savings.  For example, it may take only 2 minutes to machine the face of a small part, but it will take an hour to set the machine up to do it. Or, if there are 5 operations at 1.5 hours each, but only 30 minutes total machine time, then 7.5 hours is charged for just 30 minutes of machining. <ref>http://parametric-usa.com/how-to-design-low-price-machined-parts-and-why/</ref>\n\nLastly, the volume (number of parts to machine) plays a critical role in amortizing the set-up time, programming time and other activities into the cost of the part. In the example above, the part in quantities of 10 could cost 7-10X the cost in quantities of 100.\n\nTypically, the law of diminishing returns presents itself at volumes of 100-300 because set-up times, custom tooling and fixturing can be amortized into the noise. <ref>http://parametric-usa.com/quick-guide-cnc-machining-prototype-production/</ref>\n=== Material type ===\nThe most easily machined types of metals include [[aluminum]], [[brass]], and softer metals.  As materials get harder, denser and stronger, such as [[steel]], [[stainless steel]], [[titanium]], and exotic alloys, they become much harder to machine and take much longer, thus being less manufacturable.  Most types of [[plastic]] are easy to machine, although additions of fiberglass or carbon fiber can reduce the machinability.  Plastics that are particularly soft and gummy may have machinability problems of their own.\n\n=== Material form ===\nMetals come in all forms. In the case of aluminum as an example, bar stock and plate are the two most common forms from which machined parts are made. The size and shape of the component may determine which form of material must be used. It is common for engineering drawings to specify one form over the other.  Bar stock is generally close to 1/2 of the cost of plate on a per pound basis. So although the material form isn't directly related to the geometry of the component, cost can be removed at the design stage by specifying the least expensive form of the material.\n\n===Tolerances ===\nA significant contributing factor to the cost of a machined component is the geometric tolerance to which the features must be made.  The tighter the tolerance required, the more expensive the component will be to machine.  When designing, specify the loosest tolerance that will serve the function of the component.  Tolerances must be specified on a feature by feature basis.  There are creative ways to engineer components with lower tolerances that still perform as well as ones with higher tolerances.\n\n===Design and shape ===\nAs machining is a subtractive process, the time to remove the material is a major factor in determining the machining cost.  The volume and shape of the material to be removed as well as how fast the tools can be fed will determine the machining time.  When using [[milling cutter]]s, the strength and stiffness of the tool which is determined in part by the length to diameter ratio of the tool will play the largest role in determining that speed.  The shorter the tool is relative to its diameter the faster it can be fed through the material.  A ratio of 3:1 (L:D) or under is optimum.<ref>http://www.efunda.com/processes/machining/mill_design.cfm</ref>  If that ratio cannot be achieved, a solution like this depicted here can be used.<ref>http://procnc.com/images/content/Design_Guide_Rev_C.pdf</ref>  For holes, the length to diameter ratio of the tools are less critical, but should still be kept under 10:1.\n\nThere are many other types of features which are more or less expensive to machine.  Generally chamfers cost less to machine than radii on outer horizontal edges. 3D interpolation is used to create radii on edges that are not on the same plane which incur 10X the cost.<ref>http://parametric-usa.com/1-killer-low-price-cnc-machined-part/</ref>  Undercuts are more expensive to machine.  Features that require smaller tools, regardless of L:D ratio, are more expensive.\n\n==[[Design for Inspection]]==\nThe concept of [[Design for Inspection]] (DFI) should complement and work in collaboration with [[Design for Manufacturability]] (DFM) and [[Design for Assembly]] (DMA) to reduce product manufacturing cost and increase manufacturing practicality.\n\n==[[Design for Additive Manufacturing|Design for additive manufacturing]]==\n[[Additive manufacturing]] broadens the ability of a designer to optimize the design to save materials for example. Thus designs tailored for additive manufacturing are sometimes very different from designs tailored for machining or forming manufacturing operations.\n\nIn addition, due to some size constraints of additive manufacturing machines, sometimes the related bigger designs are split into smaller sections with self-assembly features or fasteners locators.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Electronic design automation]]\n* [[Reliability engineering]]\n* [[Six Sigma]]\n* [[Statistical process control]]\n* [[Design for X]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* Mentor Graphics - [http://www.mentor.com/products/ic_nanometer_design/techpubs/request/dfm-what-is-it-and-what-will-it-do--22338 DFM: What is it and what will it do?] (must fill request form).\n* Mentor Graphics - [http://www.mentor.com/products/ic_nanometer_design/techpubs/request/dfm-magic-bullet-or-marketing-hype-21217 DFM: Magic Bullet or Marketing Hype] (must fill request form).\n*''Electronic Design Automation For Integrated Circuits Handbook'', by Lavagno, Martin, and Scheffer, ISBN 0-8493-3096-3 A survey of the field of EDA.
