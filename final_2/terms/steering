An exception is the case of [[rail transport]] by which [[rail tracks]] combined together with [[railroad switch]]es (and also known as 'points' in British English) provide the steering function.The primary purpose of the steering system is to allow the driver to guide the vehicle.\n\n[[File:Bell-Crank Steering Linkage.gif|thumb|Bell-crank steering linkage]]\n\n[[File:Rack-And-Pinion Steering Linkage.gif|thumb|Rack-and-pinion steering linkage]]\n\n==Introduction==\nThe most conventional steering arrangement is to turn the front [[wheel]]s using a hand\u2013operated [[steering wheel]] which is positioned in front of the driver, via the [[steering column]], which may contain [[universal joint]]s (which may also be part of the collapsible steering column design), to allow it to deviate somewhat from a straight line. Other arrangements are sometimes found on different types of vehicles, for example, a [[tiller]] or rear\u2013wheel steering. [[Tracked vehicle]]s such as [[bulldozer]]s and [[tank]]s usually employ '''differential steering''' \u2014 that is, the tracks are made to move at different speeds or even in opposite directions, using [[clutch]]es and [[brake]]s, to bring about a change of course or direction.\n\n==Wheeled vehicle steering==\n\n===Basic geometry===\n[[File:Ackermann turning.svg|thumb|250px|left|Ackermann steering geometry]]\n[[File:Ackerman Steering Linkage.gif|thumb|left|Ackerman steering linkage]]\n[[File:Caster angle.svg|thumb|right|200px|[[Caster angle|Caster angle \u03b8]] indicates [[Kingpin (automotive part)|kingpin]] pivot line and gray area indicates vehicle's tire with the wheel moving from right to left. A positive caster angle aids in [[directional stability]], as the wheel tends to trail, but a large angle makes steering more difficult.]]\n[[File:Curves, described by a simple moving vehicle.ogv|thumbnail|Curves described by the rear wheels of a conventional automobile. While the vehicle moves with a constant speed its inner and outer rear wheels do not.]]\nThe basic aim of steering is to ensure that the wheels are pointing in the desired directions. This is typically achieved by a series of linkages, rods, pivots and gears. One of the fundamental concepts is that of ''[[caster angle]]'' \u2013 each wheel is steered with a pivot point ahead of the wheel; this makes the steering tend to be self-centering towards the direction of travel.\n\nThe steering linkages connecting the steering box and the wheels usually conform to a variation of [[Ackermann steering geometry]], to account for the fact that in a turn, the inner wheel is actually travelling a path of smaller radius than the outer wheel, so that the degree of [[toe (automotive)|toe]] suitable for driving in a straight path is not suitable for turns. The angle the wheels make with the vertical plane also influences steering dynamics (see ''[[camber angle]]'') as do the [[tire]]s.\n\n===Rack and pinion, recirculating ball, worm and sector===\n[[File:Steer system.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Rack and pinion]]  steering mechanism: 1 steering wheel; 2 steering column; 3 rack and pinion; 4 tie rod; 5 kingpin]]\n[[Image:WrightspeedStearingRack4888.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Rack and pinion unit mounted in the cockpit of an [[Ariel Atom]] sports car chassis. For most high volume production, this is usually mounted on the other side of this panel]]\n[[Image:Scatola di sterzo.jpg|thumb|Steering box of a motor vehicle, the traditional (non-assisted), you may notice that the system allows you to adjust the braking and steering systems, you can also see the attachment system to the frame.]]\nMany modern cars use [[rack and pinion]] steering mechanisms, where the steering wheel turns the pinion gear; the pinion moves the rack, which is a linear gear that meshes with the pinion, converting circular motion into linear motion along the transverse axis of the car (side to side motion). This motion applies steering [[torque]] to the swivel pin ball joints that replaced previously used [[kingpin (mechanics)|kingpin]]s of the stub axle of the steered wheels via [[tie rod]]s and a short [[lever]] arm called the steering arm.\n\nThe rack and pinion design has the advantages of a large degree of feedback and direct steering \"feel\". A disadvantage is that it is not adjustable, so that when it does wear and develop [[Backlash (engineering)|lash]], the only cure is replacement.\n\n[[BMW]] began to use rack and pinion steering systems in the 1930s, and many other European manufacturers adopted the technology. American automakers adopted rack and pinion steering beginning with the 1974 [[Ford Pinto]].<ref>http://www.hemmings.com/hmn/stories/2010/07/01/hmn_feature20.html</ref>\n\nOlder designs  use two main principles: the [[worm and sector]] design and the screw and nut. Both types were enhanced by reducing the friction; for screw and nut it is the [[recirculating ball]] mechanism, which is still found on trucks and utility vehicles. The steering column turns a large screw which meshes with nut by recirculating balls. The nut moves a sector of a gear, causing it to rotate about its axis as the screw is turned; an arm attached to the axis of the sector moves the [[Pitman arm]], which is connected to the [[Linkage (mechanical)#Types of linkages|steering linkage]] and thus steers the wheels. The recirculating ball version of this apparatus reduces the considerable friction by placing large ball bearings between the screw and the nut; at either end of the apparatus the balls exit from between the two pieces into a channel internal to the box which connects them with the other end of the apparatus, thus they are \"recirculated\".\n\nThe recirculating ball mechanism has the advantage of a much greater [[mechanical advantage]], so that it was found on larger, heavier vehicles while the rack and pinion was originally limited to smaller and lighter ones; due to the almost universal adoption of [[power steering]], however, this is no longer an important advantage, leading to the increasing use of rack and pinion on newer cars. The recirculating ball design also has a perceptible lash, or \"dead spot\" on center, where a minute turn of the steering wheel in either direction does not move the steering apparatus; this is easily adjustable via a screw on the end of the steering box to account for wear, but it cannot be entirely eliminated because it will create excessive internal forces at other positions and the mechanism will wear very rapidly. This design is still in use in trucks and other large vehicles, where rapidity of steering and direct feel are less important than robustness, maintainability, and mechanical advantage.\n\nThe worm and sector was an older design, used for example in Willys and Chrysler vehicles, and the Ford Falcon (1960's). To reduce  friction the sector is replaced by a roller or rotating  pins on the rocker shaft arm.\n\nOther systems for steering exist, but are uncommon on road vehicles. Children's toys and [[go-kart]]s often use a very direct linkage in the form of a [[bellcrank]] (also commonly known as a [[Pitman arm]]) attached directly between the steering column and the steering arms, and the use of cable-operated steering linkages (e.g. the [[Capstan and Bowstring|capstan and bowstring]] mechanism) is also found on some home-built vehicles such as [[soapbox car]]s and [[recumbent tricycle]]s.\n\n===Power steering===\n{{Main|Power steering}}\n\nPower steering helps the driver of a vehicle to steer by directing some of its power to assist in swiveling the steered road wheels about their steering axes.  As vehicles have become heavier and switched to [[front wheel drive]], particularly using negative offset geometry, along with increases in tire width and diameter, the effort needed to turn the wheels about their steering axis has increased, often to the point where major physical exertion would be needed were it not for power assistance.  To alleviate this [[auto maker]]s have developed [[power steering]] systems, or more correctly power-assisted steering, since on road-going vehicles there has to be a mechanical linkage as a fail-safe. There are two types of power steering systems: hydraulic and electric/electronic. A hydraulic-electric hybrid system is also possible.\n\nA [[hydraulic power steering]] (HPS) uses hydraulic pressure supplied by an engine-driven pump to assist the motion of turning the steering wheel. [[Electric power steering]] (EPS) is more efficient than hydraulic power steering, since the electric power steering motor only needs to provide assistance when the steering wheel is turned, whereas the hydraulic pump must run constantly. In EPS, the amount of assistance is easily tunable to the vehicle type, road speed, and even driver preference.  An added benefit is the elimination of environmental hazard posed by leakage and disposal of hydraulic power steering fluid.  In addition, electrical assistance is not lost when the engine fails or stalls, whereas hydraulic assistance stops working if the engine stops, making the steering doubly heavy as the driver must now turn not only the very heavy steering\u2014without any help\u2014but also the power-assistance system itself.\n\n===Speed sensitive steering===\nAn outgrowth of power steering is speed sensitive steering, where the steering is heavily assisted at low speed and lightly assisted at high speed. Auto makers perceive that motorists might need to make large steering inputs while manoeuvering for parking, but not while traveling at high speed. The first vehicle with this feature was the [[Citro\u00ebn SM]] with its [[DIRAVI|Diravi]] layout,<ref>http://www.cnet.com/videos/top-5-citroen-sm-innovations-that-saw-the-future/</ref> although rather than altering the amount of assistance as in modern power steering systems, it altered the pressure on a centring cam which made the steering wheel try to \"spring\" back to the straight-ahead position. Modern speed-sensitive power steering systems reduce the mechanical or electrical assistance as the vehicle speed increases, giving a more direct feel. This feature is gradually becoming more common.\n\n===Four-wheel steering===<!-- This section is linked from [[Nissan Z-car]] -->\n[[File:4WSselect.svg|thumb|right|200px|Speed-dependent four-wheel steering.]]\n[[File:Caldwell vale tractor.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Early example of four-wheel steering. 1910 photograph of 80 hp [[Caldwell Vale]] tractor in action.]]\n[[File:Mercedes K\u00fcbelwagen G5.jpg|thumb|right|200px|1937 Mercedes-Benz Type G 5 with four-wheel steering.]]\n[[image:Quadrasteer61.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Sierra Denali with [[Quadrasteer]], rear steering angle.]]\n[[File:Arnhem-Trolleybus-4-wheel-steering.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Articulated vehicle|Articulated]] [[Arnhem]] [[trolleybus]] demonstrating its four-wheel steering on front and rear axles (2006).]]\n[[File:Turbine Blade Delivery to Tower No 11 - geograph.org.uk - 787699.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Heavy transport trailer with all-wheel steering remote controlled by a steersman walking at the rear of the trailer (2008).]]\n[[File:Bauma 2007 Telescopic Handler Liebherr 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|2007 Liebherr-Bauma [[telescopic handler]] using crab steering.]]\n[[File:HAMM DV70 Tandemwalze im Hundegang.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hamm AG|Hamm DV70 tandem roller]] using crab steering to cover maximum road surface (2010).]]\n[[File:Slurry applicator - geograph.org.uk - 1252279.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Agricultural slurry applicator using crab steering to minimise soil compaction (2009).]]\nFour-wheel steering is a system employed by some vehicles to improve steering response, increase vehicle stability while maneuvering at high speed, or to decrease [[turning radius]] at low speed.\n\n====Active four-wheel steering====\nIn an ''active'' four-wheel steering system, all four wheels turn at the same time when the driver steers. In most active four-wheel steering systems, the rear wheels are steered by a computer and actuators. The rear wheels generally cannot turn as far as the front wheels. There can be controls to switch off the rear steer and options to steer only the rear wheels independently of the front wheels. At low speed (e.g. parking) the rear wheels turn opposite to the front wheels, reducing the turning radius by twenty-five percent, sometimes critical for large [[pickup truck|trucks]] or tractors and vehicles with trailers, while at higher speeds both front and rear wheels turn alike (electronically controlled), so that the vehicle may change position with less [[yaw angle|yaw]], enhancing straight-line stability. The \"snaking effect\" experienced during [[motorway]] drives while towing a [[travel trailer]] is thus largely nullified. {{dubious|date=February 2012}}\n\nFour-wheel steering found its most widespread use in [[monster trucks]], where maneuverability in small arenas is critical, and it is also popular in large [[farm]] vehicles and [[truck]]s. Some of the modern European Intercity buses also utilize four-wheel steering to assist maneuverability in bus terminals, and also to improve road stability. The first rally vehicle to use the technology was the Peugeot 405 Turbo 16. Its debut was at the 1988 Pikes Peak International Hill Climb, where it set a record breaking time of 10:47.77.<ref>{{cite web|title=1988 Peugeot 405 T16 GR Pikes Peak|url=http://www.supercars.net/cars/5381.html|accessdate=16 March 2015}}</ref> The car would go on to victory in the 1989 and 1990 [[Paris-Dakar Rally]], again driven by [[Ari Vatanen]].\n\nPreviously, [[Honda]] had four-wheel steering as an option in their 1987\u20132001 [[Honda Prelude|Prelude]] and Honda Ascot Innova models (1992\u20131996). [[Mazda]] also offered four-wheel steering on the [[Mazda 626|626]] and [[Mazda MX-6|MX6]] in 1988. [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] offered [[Delphi Corporation|Delphi]]'s [[Quadrasteer]] in their consumer [[Chevrolet Silverado|Silverado]]/[[GMC Sierra|Sierra]] and [[Chevrolet Suburban|Suburban]]/[[Chevrolet Tahoe|Yukon]]. However, only 16,500 vehicles were sold with this system from its introduction in 2002 through 2004. Due to this low demand, GM discontinued the technology at the end of the 2005 model year.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://wardsautoworld.com/ar/auto_quadrasteer_off_course/\n| title = Quadrasteer Off Course\n| first1 = Tom | last1 = Murphy | first2 = Brian | last2 = Corbett\n| date = 2005-03-01\n| publisher = Wards Auto World\n| accessdate = 2010-06-11}}</ref> [[Nissan]]/[[Infiniti]] offer several versions of their [[HICAS]] system as standard or as an option in much of their line-up. A new \"Active Drive\" system is introduced on the 2008 version of the [[Renault Laguna]] line. It was designed as one of several measures to increase security and stability. The Active Drive should lower the effects of under steer and decrease the chances of spinning by diverting part of the G-forces generated in a turn from the front to the rear tires. At low speeds the turning circle can be tightened so parking and maneuvering is easier.\n\n=====Production cars with active four wheel steering=====\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Audi Q7#Second generation (2015\u2013)|Audi Q7]] ('''all-wheel steering''', on second generation from 2015) <ref>https://www.audi-mediaservices.com/publish/ms/content/en/public/pressemitteilungen/2014/12/12/the_new_audi_q7__.html The new Audi Q7 \u2013  Sportiness, efficiency, premium comfort</ref>\n*[[Acura RLX]] (P-AWS)\n*[[Acura TLX]] (P-AWS), front drive models\n*[[BMW 850CSi]] (only Euro spec models)\n*[[BMW 7-Series]] (2009 onward, part of sport package) <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/sedans/112_0810_2009_bmw_7_series_technical_details/index.html |title=2009 BMW 750Li and 750i Technology -

It operates by steering all wheels in the same direction and at the same angle. Crab steering is used when the vehicle needs to proceed in a straight line but under an angle (i.e. when moving loads with a reach truck, or during filming with a camera dolly), or when the rear wheels may not follow the front wheel tracks (i.e. to reduce soil compaction when using rolling farm equipment).\n\n====Passive rear wheel steering====\nMany modern vehicles have ''passive'' rear steering. On many vehicles, when cornering, the rear wheels tend to steer slightly to the outside of a turn, which can reduce stability. The passive steering system uses the lateral forces generated in a turn (through suspension geometry) and the [[Bushing (isolator)|bushings]] to correct this tendency and steer the wheels slightly to the inside of the corner. This improves the stability of the car, through the turn. This effect is called compliance [[understeer]] and it, or its opposite, is present on all suspensions. Typical methods of achieving compliance understeer are to use a [[Watt's linkage|Watt's link]] on a live rear axle, or the use of toe control bushings on a [[Twist-beam rear suspension|twist beam suspension]]. On an [[independent rear suspension]] it is normally achieved by changing the rates of the rubber bushings in the suspension. Some suspensions typically have compliance [[oversteer]] due to geometry, such as [[Hotchkiss drive|Hotchkiss live axles]] or a semi-trailing arm IRS, but may be mitigated by revisions to the pivot points of the leaf spring or trailing arm.\n\nPassive rear wheel steering is not a new concept, as it has been in use for many years, although not always recognised as such.\n\n===Articulated steering===\n[[File:ChelProm Front-end single-bucket loaders PK-27.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Front [[loader (equipment)|loader]] with articulated steering (2007).]]\n[[Articulated vehicle|Articulated steering]] is a system by which a four-wheel drive vehicle is split into front and rear halves which are connected by a vertical hinge. The front and rear halves are connected with one or more [[hydraulic cylinder]]s that change the angle between the halves, including the front and rear axles and wheels, thus steering the vehicle. This system does not use steering arms, king pins, tie rods, etc. as does four-wheel steering. If the vertical hinge is placed equidistant between the two axles, it also eliminates the need for a central [[Differential (mechanics)|differential]], as both front and rear axles will follow the same path, and thus rotate at the same speed. Long [[road train]]s, [[articulated bus]]es, and internal transport trolley trains use articulated steering to achieve smaller turning circles, comparable to those of shorter conventional vehicles. [[Articulated hauler]]s have very good off-road performance.\n\n===Rear wheel steering===\nA few types of vehicle use only rear wheel steering, notably [[fork lift truck]]s, [[Camera dolly|camera dollies]], early [[Loader (equipment)|pay loaders]], [[Buckminster Fuller]]'s [[Dymaxion car]], and the [[ThrustSSC]].<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.thrustssc.com/thrustssc/Engineering/rearster.html\n| title = Thrust SSC - Engineering\n| accessdate = 2010-05-26}}</ref>\n\nRear wheel steering tends to be unstable because in turns the steering geometry changes hence decreasing the turn radius (over steer), rather than increase it (under steer). Rear wheel steering is meant for slower vehicles that need high-maneuverability in tight spaces, e.g. fork lifts.\n\n===Steer-by-wire===\n[[File:Lunar vehicle.jpg|thumb|right|200px|1971 Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) with joystick steering controls.]]\n[[File:Honda EV-STER twin-lever steering 2012 Tokyo Auto Salon.jpg|thumb|right|200px|2012 Honda EV-STER \"Twin Lever Steering\" concept.]]\nThe aim of ''[[steer-by-wire]]'' technology is to completely do away with as many mechanical components (steering shaft, column, gear reduction mechanism, etc.) as possible. Completely replacing conventional steering system with steer-by-wire holds several advantages, such as:\n\n*The absence of steering column simplifies the car interior design.\n*The absence of steering shaft, column and gear reduction mechanism allows much better space utilization in the engine compartment.\n*The steering mechanism can be designed and installed as a modular unit.\n*Without mechanical connection between the steering wheel and the road wheel, it is less likely that the impact of a frontal crash will force the steering wheel to intrude into the driver's survival space.\n*Steering system characteristics can easily and infinitely be adjusted to optimize the steering response and feel.\n\nAs of 2007 there are no production cars available that rely solely on steer-by-wire technology due to safety, reliability and economic concerns, but this technology has been demonstrated in numerous [[concept cars]] and the similar ''[[fly-by-wire]]'' technology is in use in both military and civilian aviation applications. Removing the mechanical steering linkage in road going vehicles would require new legislation in most countries.\n\n===Safety===\n{{Main|Automobile safety}}\nFor safety reasons all modern cars feature a collapsible steering column (energy absorbing steering column) which will collapse in the event of a heavy frontal impact to avoid excessive injuries to the driver. [[Airbag]]s are also generally fitted as standard. Non-collapsible steering columns fitted to older vehicles very often [[Impalement|impaled]] drivers in frontal crashes, particularly when the steering box or rack was mounted in front of the front axle line, at the front of the [[crumple zone]]. This was particularly a problem on vehicles that had a rigid separate chassis frame, with no crumple zone. Most modern vehicle steering boxes/racks are mounted behind the front axle on the front bulkhead, at the rear of the front crumple zone.\n\nCollapsible steering columns were invented by [[Bela Barenyi]] and were introduced in the 1959 [[Mercedes-Benz W111]] Fintail, along with crumple zones. This safety feature first appeared{{when|date=February 2012}} on cars built by [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] after an extensive and very public [[lobbying]] campaign enacted by [[Ralph Nader]]. [[Ford]] started to install collapsible steering columns in 1968.<ref>{{cite web|last=Smart|first= Jim|url=http://www.mustangandfords.com/howto/30247_collapsible_steering_column/|title=Collapsible Steering Column Installation}}</ref>\n\n[[Audi]] used a retractable steering wheel and seat belt tensioning system called [[procon-ten]], but it has since been discontinued in favor of airbags and pyrotechnic seat belt pre-tensioners.\n\n===Cycles===\nSteering is crucial to the stability of [[bicycle]]s and [[motorcycle]]s. For details, see articles on [[bicycle and motorcycle dynamics]] and [[countersteering]]. Steering [[Monowheel#Steering|monocycles]] and [[Unicycle#Theory|unicycles]] is especially complicated.\n\n==Watercraft steering==\nShips and boats are usually steered with a [[rudder]]. Depending on the size of the vessel, rudders can be manually actuated, or operated using a [[servomechanism]], or a [[trim tab]]/[[servo tab]] system. Boats using [[outboard motor]]s steer by rotating the entire drive unit. Boats with inboard motors sometimes steer by rotating the propeller pod only (i.e. [[Volvo Penta|Volvo Penta IPS drive]]). Modern ships with diesel-electric drive use [[azimuth thruster]]s. Boats driven by [[oar]]s (i.e. [[Watercraft rowing|rowing boats]], including [[gondola]]s) or [[paddle]]s (i.e. [[canoe]]s, [[kayak]]s, [[raft]]s) are steered by generating a higher propulsion force on the side of the boat opposite of the direction of turn. [[Jet ski]]s are steered by weight-shift induced roll and water jet [[thrust vectoring]]. [[Waterskiing|Water ski]]s and [[surfboard]]s are steered by weight-shift induced roll only.\n\n==Aircraft and hovercraft steering==\n[[Airplane]]s are normally steered by the use of [[aileron]]s to bank the aircraft into a turn - the rudder is used to minimise [[adverse yaw]], rather than as a means to directly cause the turn. [[Missile]]s, [[airship]]s and [[hovercraft]] are usually steered by [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] and/or [[thrust vectoring]]. [[Jet pack]]s and flying platforms are steered by [[thrust vectoring]] only. [[Helicopter]]s are steered by cyclic control, changing the thrust vector of the main rotor(s), and by anti-torque control, usually provided by a tail rotor (see ''[[helicopter flight controls]]'').\n\n==Other types of steering==\n[[Tunnel boring machine]]s are steered by hydraulic tilting of the cutter head. Rail track vehicles (i.e. [[train]]s, [[tram]]s) are steered by curved guide tracks, including switches, and articulated undercarriages. [[Land sailing|Land yachts]] on wheels and [[Kite buggy|kite buggies]] are steered similarly to cars. [[Ice yachting|Ice yachts]] and [[bobsleigh]]s are steered by rotating the front runners out of the direction of travel. [[Snowmobile]]s steer the same way by rotating the front skis. Tracked vehicles (i.e. [[tank]]s) steer by increasing the drive force on the side opposite of the direction of turn. [[Sled|Horse-drawn sleighs]] and [[dog sled]]s are steered by changing the direction of pull. [[Zero-turn mower|Zero-turn]] [[lawn mower]]s use independent hydraulic wheel drive to turn on the spot.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Active Yaw Control|Active Yaw Control (AYC)]]\n*[[Bump Steer]]\n*[[Camber angle]]\n*[[Camber thrust]]\n*[[Caster angle]]\n*[[DIRAVI]]\n*[[Drifting (motorsport)|Drifting]]\n*[[Dry steering]]\n*[[HICAS]]\n*[[Kingpin (automotive part)|Kingpin]]\n*[[Power steering]]\n*[[Skid steer]]\n*[[Steer-by-wire]]\n*[[Steering damper]]\n*[[Steering kickback]]\n*[[Steering law]]\n*[[Steering ratio]]\n*[[Steering wheel]]\n*[[Steering wheel (ship)]]\n*[[Tiller]]\n*[[Torque steering]]\n*[[Turning radius]]\n*[[Vehicle dynamics]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n*''Encyclopedia of German Tanks of World War Two'' by Peter Chamberlain and Hilary Doyle, 1978, 1999\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n* [http://auto.howstuffworks.com/steering.htm How Car Steering Works (HowStuffWorks.com)]\n* [http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&id=JMDEDB000122000002000194000001&idtype=cvips&gifs=yes&ref=no 2000 technical paper on the kinematic design of rack-and-pinion steering linkages]\n* [http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&id=JMDEDB000124000004000646000001&idtype=cvips&gifs=yes&ref=no 2002 technical paper on the kinematic design of [[bellcrank]] steering linkages]\n\n{{Automotive handling}}\n{{Powertrain}}\n\n[[Category:Automotive steering technologies]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]"}]}}}}
