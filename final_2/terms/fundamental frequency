The period of a waveform is the ''T'' for which the following equation is true:\n:<math> x(t) = x(t + T)\\text{ for all }t \\in \\mathbb{R} </math>\n\nWhere ''x''(''t'') is the value of the waveform at t. This means that this equation and a definition of the waveforms values over any interval of length ''T'' is all that is required to describe the waveform completely.\n\nEvery waveform may be described using any multiple of this period. There exists a smallest period over which the function may be described completely and this period is the fundamental period. The fundamental frequency is defined as its reciprocal:\n\n:<math> f_0 = \\frac{1}{T}</math>\n\n[[File:F0leftclosed.gif|thumb|F0leftclosed]]Since the period is measured in units of time, then the units for frequency are 1/time.  When the time units are seconds, the frequency is in <math>s^{-1}</math>, also known as [[Hertz]].[[File:F0rightclosed.gif|thumb|F0rightclosed]]\n\nFor a tube of length ''L'' with one end closed and the other end open the wavelength of the fundamental harmonic is 4''L'', as indicated by the top two animations on the right. Hence,\n:<math>\\lambda_0 = 4L.</math>\n\nTherefore, using the relation\n:<math> \\lambda_0 = \\frac{v}{f_0}</math> ,\nwhere ''v'' is the speed of the wave, we can find the fundamental frequency in terms of the speed of the wave and the length of the tube:\n:<math> f_0 = \\frac{v}{4L}.</math>\n\n[[File:F0bothclosed.gif|thumb|F0bothclosed]][[File:F0bothopen.gif|thumb|F0bothopen]]If the ends of the same tube are now both closed or both opened as in the bottom two animations on the right, the wavelength of the fundamental harmonic becomes 2''L''.  By the same method as above, the fundamental frequency is found to be\n:<math> f_0 = \\frac{v}{2L}.</math>\n\nAt 20&nbsp;\u00b0C (68&nbsp;\u00b0F) the [[speed of sound]] in air is 343&nbsp;m/s (1129&nbsp;ft/s). This speed is [[Speed of sound#Practical formula for dry air|temperature dependent]] and does increase at a rate of 0.6&nbsp;m/s for each degree Celsius increase in temperature (1.1&nbsp;ft/s for every increase of 1&nbsp;\u00b0F).\n\nThe velocity of a sound wave at different temperatures:-\n*v = 343.2&nbsp;m/s at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C\n*v = 331.3&nbsp;m/s at 0&nbsp;\u00b0C\n\n==In music==\nIn music, the fundamental is the musical [[pitch (music)|pitch]] of a note that is perceived as the lowest [[harmonic series (music)#Partial|partial]] present. The fundamental may be created by [[vibration]] over the full length of a string or air column, or a higher harmonic chosen by the player. The fundamental is one of the [[harmonic]]s. A harmonic is any member of the harmonic series, an ideal set of frequencies that are positive integer multiples of a common fundamental frequency. The reason a fundamental is also considered a harmonic is because it is 1 times itself.\n<ref>{{cite book | title = Music, Cognition, and Computerized Sound | author = [[John R.

Overtones are other sinusoidal components present at frequencies above the fundamental. All of the frequency components that make up the total waveform, including the fundamental and the overtones, are called partials. Together they form the harmonic series. Overtones which are perfect integer multiples of the fundamental are called harmonics. When an overtone is near to being harmonic, but not exact, it is sometimes called a harmonic partial, although they are often referred to simply as harmonics. Sometimes overtones are created that are not anywhere near a harmonic, and are just called partials or inharmonic overtones.\n\nThe fundamental frequency is considered the ''first harmonic'' and the ''first partial.''  The numbering of the partials and harmonics is then usually the same; the second partial is the second harmonic, etc.  But if there are inharmonic partials, the numbering no longer coincides. Overtones are numbered as they appear ''above'' the fundamental. So strictly speaking, the ''first'' overtone is the ''second'' partial (and usually the ''second'' harmonic). As this can result in confusion, only harmonics are usually referred to by their numbers, and overtones and partials are described by their relationships to those harmonics.\n\n== Mechanical systems ==\nConsider a spring, fixed at one end and having a mass attached to the other; this would be a single degree of freedom (SDoF) oscillator. Once set into motion it will oscillate at its natural frequency. For a single degree of freedom oscillator, a system in which the motion can be described by a single coordinate, the natural frequency depends on two system properties: mass and stiffness; (providing the system is undamped). The radian frequency, ''\u03c9''<sub>n</sub>, can be found using the following equation:\n:<math> \\omega_\\mathrm{n}^2 = \\frac{k}{m} \\, </math>\n\nWhere:<br/>\n''k'' = [[stiffness]] of the spring<br/>\n''m'' = mass <br/>\n''\u03c9''<sub>n</sub> = radian frequency (radians per second)\n\nFrom the radian frequency, the natural frequency, ''f''<sub>n</sub>, can be found by simply dividing ''\u03c9''<sub>n</sub> by 2''\u03c0''. Without first finding the radian frequency, the natural frequency can be found directly using:\n:<math>f_\\mathrm{n} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} \\,</math>\n\nWhere:<br/>\n''f''<sub>n</sub> = natural frequency in hertz (cycles/second)<br/>\n''k'' = stiffness of the spring (Newtons/meter or N/m)<br/>\n''m'' = mass(kg)  <br/>\nwhile doing the modal analysis of structures and mechanical equipment, the frequency of 1st mode is called fundamental frequency.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Hertz]]\n*[[Missing fundamental]]\n*[[Natural frequency]]\n*[[Oscillation]]\n*[[Harmonic series (music)#Terminology]]\n*[[Pitch detection algorithm]]\n*[[Scale of harmonics]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Acoustics}}\n{{Strings (music)}}\n{{Timbre}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fundamental Frequency}}\n[[Category:Musical tuning]]\n[[Category:Acoustics]]\n[[Category:Fourier analysis]]"}]}}}}
