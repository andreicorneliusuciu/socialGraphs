This can be contrasted with [[steer (automotive)|steer]], which is the antisymmetric angle, i.e. both wheels point to the left or right, in parallel (roughly). Negative toe, or '''toe out''', is the front of the wheel pointing away from the centerline of the vehicle. Positive toe, or '''toe in''', is the front of the wheel pointing towards the centerline of the vehicle.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.auto-ware.com/setup/toe_hand.htm |title=Toe-out and Handling, steering geometry & front end alignment  |work=auto-ware.com |accessdate=28 August 2011}}</ref> Toe can be measured in linear units, at the front of the tire, or as an angular deflection.\n\nIn a [[rear wheel drive]] car, increased front toe in provides greater straight-line stability at the cost of some sluggishness of turning response. The wear on the tires is marginally increased as the tires are under slight side slip conditions. On [[front wheel drive]] cars, the situation is more complex.\n\nToe is usually adjustable in production automobiles, even though [[caster angle]] and [[camber angle]] are often not adjustable. Maintenance of [[wheel alignment|front end alignment]], which used to involve all three adjustments, currently involves only setting the toe; in most cases, even for a car in which caster or camber are adjustable, only the toe will need adjustment.        \nOne related concept is that the proper toe for straight line travel of a vehicle will not be correct while turning, since the inside wheel must travel around a smaller radius than the outside wheel; to compensate for this, the [[Linkage (mechanical)#Types of linkages|steering linkage]] typically conforms more or less to [[Ackermann steering geometry]], modified to suit the characteristics of the individual vehicle.\n\n==Road-rail vehicles==\nThe front rail wheels of [[road-rail vehicle]]s are often set to toe-in by a distance of 6 mm over 1 metre. Unlike other forms of rolling stock, [[Road-rail vehicle|Road-rail vehicles]] do not always have a common axle between the rail wheels and the toe-in angle prevents the vehicle from [[Hunting oscillation|hunting]] when on-rail.\n\n==Interaction with camber==\n\nWhen a wheel is set up to have some [[camber angle]], the interaction between the tire and road surface causes the wheel to tend to want to roll in a curve, as if it were part of a conical surface ([[camber thrust]]). This tendency to turn increases the [[rolling resistance]] as well as increasing tire wear. A small degree of toe (toe-out for negative camber, toe-in for positive camber) will cancel this turning tendency, reducing wear and rolling resistance. On some competition vehicles such as [[go-kart]]s, especially where power is extremely limited and is highly regulated by the rules of the sport, these effects can become very significant in terms of competitiveness and performance.\nToe-in and toe-out give the steering stability.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Camber thrust]]\n* [[Caster angle]]\n* [[Vehicle dynamics]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.ozebiz.com.au/racetech/theory/align.html Camber, Caster, Toe - What does it all mean?]\n*[http://www.240edge.com/performance/tuning-toe.html Toe and Race Car Suspension Tuning]\n*[http://www.familycar.com/alignment.htm Wheel Alignment: a Short Course]\n*[http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tiretech/techpage.jsp?techid=4 Tirerack: Alignment, Thrust, Camber, Caster, Toe]\n\n{{Powertrain}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2011}}\n\n[[Category:Automotive steering technologies]]"}]}}}}
