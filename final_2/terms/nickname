Lithograph by Mackwitz, St. Louis, 1884.]]\n[[File:Why London Underground is nicknamed The Tube.jpg|thumb|right|340px|The [[London Underground]] is nicknamed \"the Tube\"]]\n\nA '''nickname''' is a substitute for the proper name of a familiar person, place, or thing, for affection or ridicule.<ref>{{Citation | contribution = nickname |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/nickname | title = Oxford English Dictionary | edition = online | accessdate = September 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe term [[hypocoristic]] is used to refer to a nickname of affection between those in love or with a close emotional bond, compared with a [[term of endearment]]. The term [[diminutive]] name refers to nicknames that convey smallness, hence something regarded with affection or familiarity (e.g., referring to children), or contempt.<ref>{{Citation | title = Shorter Oxford English Dictionary | edition = 6th}}.</ref>\n\nThe distinction between the two is often blurred. It is a form of endearment and amusement. As a concept, it is distinct from both [[pseudonym]] and [[stage name]], and also from a title (for example, City of Fountains), although there may be overlap in these concepts.\n\nA '''moniker''' also means a nickname or personal name.<ref name=merriam-webster>{{cite web\n|title=dictionary\n|work=merriam-webster\n|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/moniker }}</ref>\nThe word often distinguishes personal names from nicknames that became proper names out of former nicknames. English examples are Bob and Rob, nickname variants for Robert.\n\nA nickname is often considered desirable, symbolising a form of acceptance, but can sometimes be a form of ridicule.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe compound word ''ekename'', literally meaning \"additional name\", was attested as early as 1303.<ref>This word is all but obsolete today, but one example is found in ''What Snow Disrupts'' by Daniel C. Boyer.</ref> This word was derived from the [[Old English]] phrase ''eaca'' \"an increase\", related to ''eacian'' \"to increase\".<ref>{{Citation |last=Harper |first=Douglas |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=nickname |accessdate= 2007-08-31 | title = Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref> By the fifteenth century, the [[rebracketing|misdivision of the syllables]] of the phrase \"an ekename\" led to its reanalysis as \"a nekename\".<ref>{{Citation |title=Nickname |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/nickname |accessdate=2008-10-25 |date=July 2006 |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages= 1, 4\u20139, 2 |issn= 1931-9592 | pmid = 16922251 |journal=Profiles in healthcare communications}}</ref> Though the spelling has changed, the pronunciation and meaning of the word have remained relatively stable ever since.\n\n== Conventions in various languages ==\nTo inform an audience or readership of a person's nickname without actually calling them by their nickname, English nicknames are generally represented in quotes between the bearer's first and last names (e.g., ''[[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Dwight David \"Ike\" Eisenhower]]'', ''[[Bubba Franks|Daniel Lamont \"Bubba\" Franks]]'', etc.). However, it is also common for the nickname to be identified after a comma following the full real name or later in the body of the text, such as in an obituary. The middle name is generally eliminated (if there is one), especially in speech. Like English, German uses (German-style) quotation marks between the first and last names (e.g., ''[[Niki Lauda|Andreas Nikolaus \u201eNiki\u201c Lauda]]''). Other languages may use other conventions; for example, Italian writes the nickname after the full name followed by ''detto'' 'called' (e.g., ''[[Salvatore Schillaci|Salvatore Schillaci detto Tot\u00f2]]''), in Spanish the nickname is written in formal contexts at the end in quotes following ''alias'' (e.g. ''Alfonso Tostado, alias \u00abel Abulense\u00bb''), and Slovenian represents nicknames after a dash or hyphen (e.g., ''[[Franc Rozman \u2013 Stane]]''). The latter may cause confusion because it resembles an English convention sometimes used for [[married and maiden names]].\n\n== Uses in various societies ==\nIn [[Viking]] societies, many people had ''heiti'', ''vi\u00f0rnefni'', or ''kenningarn\u00f6fn'' (Old Norse terms for nicknames) which were used in addition to, or instead of the first name. In some circumstances, the giving of a nickname had a special status in Viking society in that it created a relationship between the name maker and the recipient of the nickname, to the extent that the creation of a nickname also often entailed a formal [[ceremony]] and an [[gift exchange|exchange of gifts]] known in Old Norse as ''nafnfestr'' ('fastening a name').\n\nSlaves have often used nicknames, so that the master who heard about someone doing something could not identify the slave. In [[capoeira]], a Brazilian martial art, the slaves had nicknames to protect them from being caught, as practising capoeira was illegal for decades.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nIn Anglo-American culture, a nickname is often based on a shortening of a person's proper name. However, in other societies, this may not necessarily be the case. For example: \"my nickname is farmer Phil\" \n\nIn [[Indian culture|Indian]] society, for example, generally people have at least one nickname (''call name'' or ''affection name'') and these affection names are generally not related to the person's proper name. Indian nicknames very often are a trivial word or a ''diminutive'' (such as ''Bablu'', ''Dabbu'', ''Banti'', ''Babli'', ''Gudiya'', ''Golu'', ''Sonu'', ''Chhotu'', ''Raju'', ''Adi'', ''Ritu'', etc.).\n\nIn Australian society, Australian men will often give ironic nicknames. For example, a man with [[red hair]] will be given the nickname 'Blue' or 'Bluey'. A tall man will be called 'Shorty', an obese person 'Slim' and so on.\n\nIn England, some nicknames are traditionally associated with a person's surname. A man with the surname 'Clark' will be nicknamed 'Nobby': the surname 'Miller' will have the nickname 'Dusty' (alluding to the flour dust of a miller at work): the surname 'Adams' has the nickname 'Nabby'. There are several other nicknames linked traditionally with a person's surname, including Chalky White, Bunny Warren, Tug Wilson, and Spud Baker. Other English nicknames allude to a person's origins. A Scotsman may be nicknamed 'Jock', an Irishman 'Paddy' (alluding to St Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland) or 'Mick' (alluding to the preponderance of Roman Catholicism in Ireland), and a Welshman may be nicknamed 'Taffy'. Traditional English nicknaming was common through the first half of the twentieth century, and was frequently used in the armed services during World War I and World War II, but has become less common since then.\n\nIn Chinese culture, nicknames are frequently used within a community amongst relatives, friends and neighbors. A typical southern Chinese nickname often begins with a \"\u963f\" followed by another character, usually the last character of the person's given name. For example, Taiwanese politician [[Chen Shui-bian]] (\u9648\u6c34\u6241) is sometimes referred as \"\u963f\u6241\" (A-Bian). In many Chinese communities of Southeast Asia, nicknames may also connote one's occupation or status. For example, the landlord might be known simply as ''Towkay'' ([[Hokkien]] for \"boss\") to his tenants or workers while a bread seller would be called \"Mianbao Shu\" \u9762\u5305\u53d4 (literally, Uncle Bread). Amongst [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]]-speaking communities, the character \"\u4ed4\" (pronounced \"zai\") may be used in a similar context of \"Junior\" in Western naming practices.\n\n== Performing arts and literature ==\nMany writers, performing artists, and actors have nicknames, which may develop into a [[stage name]] or [[pseudonym]]. A [[bardic name]] may also result from a nickname. Many writers have pen names which they use instead of their real names. Famous writers with a [[pen name]] go as far back as [[Plato#Name|Plato]] (according to a late tradition) and [[Paul the Apostle#Names|Paul]], and see also this [[List of pen names]].\n\n== Sports ==\n{{See also|Athletic nickname|List of sportspeople by nickname}}\nIt is not uncommon for sportspeople or a sports team to have nicknames. Some, such as those of sports clubs or athletic teams, are official while others are adopted over time.\n\n== Computing ==\n{{see also|User (computing)}}\n\nIn the context of information technology, a nickname (or technically a ''nick'') is a common synonym for the ''screenname'' or ''handle'' of a [[User (computing)|user]].\n\nNickname is a name to shorten a name. '''Nick''' is a term originally used to identify a person in a system for [[synchronous conferencing]]. In [[computer network]]s it has become a common practice for every person to also have one or more nicknames for the purposes of [[anonymity]], to avoid [[ambiguity]] or simply because the natural name or technical [[IP address|address]] would be too long to type or take too much space on the [[Computer display|screen]].\n\n== People ==\n[[Image:Carter-inauguration-large.jpg|thumb|right|220px|\"I, Jimmy Carter...\" [[Jimmy Carter|James Earl Carter]] is sworn in as President of the United States using his nickname \"Jimmy\".]]\n\nNicknames are usually awarded to, not chosen by the recipient. Some nicknames are derogatory [[name calling|name calls]]. Note: the majority of the following examples are '''[[American English]]''' usage.\nNicknames may be based on a person's name or various attributes. Attributes upon which a nickname may be based include:\n\n=== Title ===\nThey may refer to a person's occupation, social standing, or title. They may also refer to characteristics of a person.\n\n* \"[[Bones (disambiguation)#Fictional characters|Bones]]\"<!--please leave link to dab to show examples--> for a [[Temperance Brennan (Bones)|forensic scientist]], [[Leonard McCoy|surgeon]], or [[mortician]]\n* \"Sawbones\" for a [[surgeon]].\n* \"[[DOC (disambiguation)#People|Doc]]<!--please leave link to dab to show examples-->\" for a doctor or, in the military, medic.\n* \"Sparky\" for an [[electrician]] or [[radio operator]]\n* [[Geek]] for a computer technician\n* \"[[Sarge (disambiguation)|Sarge]]<!--please leave link to dab to show examples-->\" for a military [[Sergeant]] as in the comic strip [[Beetle Bailey]]\n* \"Lou\" for a Lieutenant (for example, a police lieutenant)\n* Similarly, \"Chief\" for a police or fire chief\n* [[Moneybags]] for a wealthy person.\n* [[Sir]] or [[Ma'am]] for a person of a higher rank (real or figurative).\n* [[Genius]] or brains for some one at school who is believed to be a clever person, although it should be said that \"genius\" in this colloquial sense is not the same as the technical use of the term \"genius\" in [[psychology]].\n\n=== Physical characteristics, personality, or lifestyle ===\n\n==== Physical characteristics ====\n[[File:Weimaraner wb.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The [[Weimaraner]]'s coat color led to its nickname of the \"Silver Ghost\".]]\nNicknames can be a descriptor of a physical characteristic, or the opposite of a physical characteristic. It should be noted that in English, such nicknames are often considered offensive or [[derogatory]], unless the nickname is based on a trait that is viewed positively.\nSome examples of nicknames related to physical characteristics include:\n*Weight: \"Fatso\" or \"Slim\" for a person who is [[overweight]] or thin, respectively.\n*Height: \"Beanpole\" or \"Long John\" (or other name) for a person who is tall, \"Shortie\" or \"small-fry\" for a [[short stature|short person]].\n*Hair colour: \"Red\", \"Ginger\", \"Ranga\", or \"Bluey\" for a person with red hair. \"Blondie\" a girl with blonde hair.\n*Type of hair: \"Curley\" or \"Cue Ball\" for a person without hair as in \"Curley\" from \"[[The Three Stooges]]\"\n*Baldness: \"Chrome dome\" for a person whose scalp reflects the light\n*Complexion: \"Pinky\" for a person with [[Rosacea]], \"Zit\" or \"pizza-face\" for severe [[acne]], various [[racial slurs]] for skin color.\n*Hand dominance: \"Lefty\" for a [[left-handed]] person.\n\nSometimes nicknames are based on things that are not a part of a person's body, but alter a person's physical appearance. Such nicknames can be temporary.\n* \"Four-eyes\" for a person with [[glasses]]\n* \"[[rail tracks|Train tracks]]\", \"tin teeth\", \"metal mouth\", or \"braceface\" for a person with [[dental braces|braces]], such as Sharon Spitz on the animated series ''[[Braceface]]''\nAll of the above examples would be offensive in most contexts.\n\n==== Personality ====\nNicknames can be a descriptor of a personality characteristic, or the opposite of a personality characteristic. These types of nicknames were often used in fairy tales such as \"[[Snow White]]\". Sometimes such nicknames may be indicative of a physical disorder.\n* Talkative: \"Motormouth\", \"Chatterbox\", \"Ratchet-Jaw\", \"[[Chatty Kathy]]\"\n* Cautious: \"Nervous Nellie\"\n* Tired Demeanor: \"Sleepy\" as in a dwarf from [[Snow White]]\n* Pessimistic: \"Sad Sack\"\n* Negative: \"Debbie Downer\"\n* Glamorous: \"Stunning Signe\"\n* Boring: \"Plain Jane\"\n* Typical: \"Average Joe\"\n* Strong-willed: \"[[The Iron Lady]]\"\n\n==== Mental characteristics ====\nA nickname may allude to a person's apparent [[intelligence]] (though often used sarcastically):\n* Encyclopedia, as in [[Donald Sobol]]'s fictional child detective [[Encyclopedia Brown|Leroy \"Encyclopedia\" Brown]]\n* [[Einstein]], referring to the famous physicist.\n* Sherlock, in reference to [[Arthur Conan Doyle|A. C. Doyle]]'s [[Sherlock Holmes]].\n* [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]], as in the fictional [[DC Comics]] character.\n*[[Dopey (disambiguation)|Dopey]]<!--please leave link to dab to show examples-->, as in the dwarf from [[Snow White]]\n\n==== Lifestyle ====\n*Promiscuity: \"Hot Lips\" as in the character \"[[Margaret Houlihan]]\" from the [[M*A*S*H]] media franchise.\n\n[[File:Mallon-Mary 01.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Mary Mallon]] (1870\u20131938) was nicknamed \"Typhoid Mary\"]]\n\n==== Other quirks ====\n* \"Booger\" for a [[nose picking]] person\n* \"Spaz\" for a person who is clumsy\n* \"Nerd\" for a person who is smart but odd\n* \"Dork\" for a person who is socially inept\n\n=== Abbreviation or modification ===\nA nickname can be a [[abbreviation|shortened]] or modified variation on a person's real name.\n* [[Contraction (grammar)|Contraction]]s of longer names: Margaret to [[Greta (disambiguation)|Greta]].\n*[[Initials]] using the first letters of a person's first and last name.\n* Dropping letters: With many nicknames, one or more letters, usually R, are dropped: [[Fanny (given name)|Fanny]] from Frances, [[Walt (disambiguation)|Walt]] from Walter.\n* Phonetic spelling : Sometimes a nickname is created through the phonetic spelling of a name: Len from Leonard.\n* Letter swapping: During the [[middle ages]], the letter R would often be swapped for either L or D: [[Hal (disambiguation)|Hal]] from Harry, [[Molly (name)|Molly]] from Mary, [[Sadie (disambiguation)|Sadie]]<!--please leave link to dab to show examples--> from Sarah, from [[Robert]]: Hob, Dob, Rob, Bob and Nob, from [[Richard]]: Rick, Dick, and Hick; Bill from [[William (name)|Will]] (which in turn comes from William), and Peg from Meg (which is derived from Margaret).\n* In 19th-century frontier America, Mary and Molly were often given the nickname [[Polly (disambiguation)|Polly]].\n\n=== Name portions ===\n* Front of name: Sometimes a nickname can come from the front: [[Chris]] from Christopher/Christina, [[Ed (disambiguation)#Ed (or ED) as a name|Ed]] from Edward/Edmond/Edgar/Edwin, [[IZ (disambiguation)|Iz]] or Izzy from Isaac/Isaiah/Isidore/Izale/Isabel/Isabella, [[Joe (disambiguation)|Joe]] or Jo from Joseph/Josephine/Joanna, Mart or Marty from Martin, Nathan or Nath from Nathaniel, Arth or Art from Arthur, Kim fom Kimberly.\n* End of name: Drew from Andrew, Xander from Alexander, Eth from Kenneth, Topher from [[Christopher (given name)|Christopher]], Beth from Elizabeth, Bel/Bell/Belle from Isabelle\n* Middle of name: Liz from Elizabeth, Tori from Victoria or Del/Della from Adelaide\n* Addition of diminutives: Before the 17th century, most nicknames had the diminutive ending \"in\" or \"Kin\", where the ending was attached to the first syllable: Watkin/Walter/Wat-kin Hobkin/Robert/Hob-kin or Thompkin/Thomas/Thom-Kin. While most of these have died away, a few remain, such as [[Robin (name)|Robin]] (Rob-in, from Robert), Hank (Hen-Kin from [[Henry (given name)|Henry]]), [[Jack (disambiguation)|Jack]] (Jan-kin from John), and [[Colin (given name)|Colin]] (Col-in from Nicolas).\n* Many nicknames usually drop the final one or two letters and add ether ie/ee/y as an ending: Davy from David, Charlie from Charles, Danny/Dani/Danie from Daniel/Danielle and Jimmy from James\n* In some cases, another name may be used as a nickname.\n* [[Acronym and initialism|Initialization]], which forms a nickname from a person's initials: [[A.C. Slater]] from Albert Clifford Slater\n* Dubya for [[George W. Bush]], a Texan pronunciation of the name of the letter 'W', President Bush's middle initial.\n* Nicknames are sometimes based on a person's last name (\"Tommo\" for Bill Thompson) or a combination of first and last name (\"[[Droopy]]\" for Andrew Peterson, or \"A-Rod\" for [[Alex Rodriguez]])\n* Loose ties to a person's name with an attached suffix: Gazza for English footballer [[Paul Gascoigne]] (though used more widely in Australia for [[Gary (given name)|Gary]]) and similar \"zza\" forms ([[Michael Heseltine|Hezza]], [[John Prescott|Prezza]], etc.) for other prominent personalities whose activities are frequently reported in the British press. (See also [[Oxford \"-er\"]] for a similar but wider phenomenon.)\n* Use of the [[second name]].\n* Combination of first and middle name, or variations of a person's first and middle name. For example, a person may have the name Mary Elizabeth but has the nickname \"Maz\" or \"Miz\" by combining Mary and Liz.\n\n=== Relationship ===\nThey may refer to the relationship with the person. This is a [[term of endearment]].\n* In [[Japanese culture]], [[Japanese honorifics]] are designed so that a term of endearment conveys the exact status of the relationship between two people. However, the recipient of the honorific is allowed to restrict the use when used by a certain person.\n\n=== Surname ===\nA few surnames have a generic and traditional nickname, at least in England. Examples of this are:\n\n* [[Nobby]]  for Clark or Clarke\n* Dusty for Miller\n* Chalkie for White\n* Bunny for Reed\n* Yosser for Hughes\n\nTo avoid confusion between peer groups with the same given names, surnames may be used as a nickname. Also common prefixes for names can be used as a nickname:\n\n* Mac for someone with the name Macmillan, MacIntyre, McCarthy, M'Clure, etc.\n* Fitz for someone with the name Fitzgerald, FitzPatrick, etc.\n\nAnd other variations on the surname, such as:\n\n* Brownie for someone with the name Brown\n* Jeff for someone with the name Geoffrey, Jeffry, Jeffrys, etc.\n* Klu (or Ski) for someone with the name Kluszewski\n* Smittie (or Smitty) for someone with the name Smith, Smythe, Goldsmith, etc.\n\n=== Action/incident ===\nIt may relate to a specific incident or action.\n* [[Capability Brown]] was so called because he used the word \"capability\" instead of \"possibility\".\n* [[Ali Hassan al-Majid|Chemical Ali]] and [[Muhammad Saeed al-Sahhaf|Comical Ali]].\n* [[Thirteen (House)|Thirteen]] for Dr. Remy Hadley from TV's ''[[House (TV series)|House M.D.]]'', because she was assigned the number 13 in her job interview process and continued to be called by her number even after she was hired.\n* \"Opa\" for the Dutch lifesaving [[Koninklijke Nederlandse Redding Maatschappij|KNRM]]-[[folk hero|hero]] [[Dorus Rijkers]]. Dorus became a [[Grandfather|Grandpa]] (Dutch:''Opa''), at the age of 23 (by marriage to a widow with eight children), and soon everybody called him ''Opa''.\n* \"[[The Falling Man]]\" for one of the jumpers during the September 11, 2001 World Trade Center terrorist attacks.\n\n=== Notable/fictional character ===\nIt may compare the person with a famous or fictional character.\n* [[Napoleon]] or [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] for someone with a [[dictatorial]] manner.\n* [[Pollyanna]] for someone with a very [[optimistic]] view of things.\n* Hawkeye from the novel ''[[The Last of the Mohicans]]'', as in [[Hawkeye Pierce]], from ''[[M*A*S*H]]'', the media franchise\n* [[Jaime Lannister]] from the novel [[A Song of Ice and Fire]], commonly known as the \"Kingslayer\". Nickname derives from killing King Aerys Targaryen in the throne room.\n\n=== Place of origin/residence ===\nIt may be related to their [[place of origin]] or [[home|residence]].\n* Gloucester, Paul from Gloucester or PFG for someone named Paul who comes from [[Gloucester]].\n* Newf or Newfie a person from [[Newfoundland, Canada|Newfoundland]], Canada\n\n=== Reputation ===\nIt may be derived from or related to what the person is well known for.\n* The Duke for [[John Wayne]]\n* The Angel of Death for [[Josef Mengele]]\n* The Hangman, The Blonde Beast for [[Reinhard Heydrich]]\n* Tippecanoe for [[William Henry Harrison]] referring to the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]]\n\n=== Affiliation ===\nIt may refer to a person's [[political affiliation]].\n* Dipper for a member of Canada's [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]].\n* [[Tory]] for a person affiliated with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|United Kingdom]]'s or Canada's [[Canadian conservatism|Conservative]] Party.\n*Grit for a member of Canada's [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]]\n\n[[File:Hirakata Nickname road Ginkgo street.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Hirakata-shi, Osaka, Japan. Nickname road \"[[Ginkgo]] street\"]]\n\n== Titles of geographical places ==\nMany geographical places have titles, or alternative names, which have positive implications. Paris, for example, is the \"City of Light\", Venice is \"La Serenissima\", and New Jersey is the \"Garden State\". It is not correct to call these titles nicknames; these alternative names are often used to boost the status of such places, contrary to the usual role of a nickname.\nMany places or communities, particularly in the USA, adopt titles because they can help in establishing a civic identity, help outsiders recognize a community or attract people to a community, promote civic pride, and build community unity.<ref name=Wisconsin>Muench, David [http://www.uwex.edu/ces/cced/economies/communityindicators/communityslogans.pdf \"Wisconsin Community Slogans: Their Use and Local Impacts\"], December 1993. Retrieved April 10, 2007.</ref> Titles and slogans that successfully create a new community \"ideology or myth\"<ref name=Branding/> are also believed to have economic value.<ref name=Wisconsin /> Their economic value is difficult to measure,<ref name=Wisconsin /> but there are anecdotal reports of cities that have achieved substantial economic benefits by \"branding\" themselves by adopting new slogans.<ref name=Branding>Alfredo Andia, [http://www.monu.org/monu7/Branding.pdf Branding the Generic City :)], MU.DOT magazine, September 10, 2007</ref>\nBy contrast, older city nicknames may be critical;  [[London]] is still occasionally referred to as \"The Smoke\" in memory of its notorious \"Pea-Souper\" [[Smog]]s (smoke-filled fogs) of the 19th and early 20th centuries, and [[Edinburgh]] was \"Auld Reekie\" for the same reason, as countless coal fires polluted its atmosphere.\n\n== Collective nicknames of inhabitants of a geographical place ==\nBesides or replacing the [[demonym]], some places have collective nicknames for their inhabitants. Many examples of this practice are found in [[Wallonia]] and in Belgium in general, where such a nickname is referred to in French as \"[[Blason populaire]]\".\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Antonomasia]]\n* [[Athletic nickname]]\n* [[Australian national sports team nicknames]]\n* [[wikt:calling name|Calling name]]\n* [[:Category:Nicknames]]\n* [[Epithet]]\n* [[Honorific nicknames in popular music]]\n* [[Legal name]]\n* [[List of basketball nicknames]]\n* [[List of city nicknames in Colorado]]\n* [[List of ethnic slurs by ethnicity]]\n* [[List of monarchs by nickname]]\n* [[List of nicknames of European Royalty and Nobility]]\n* [[List of nicknames of jazz musicians]]\n* [[List of nicknames of United States presidents]]\n* [[List of North American football nicknames]]\n* [[List of sportspeople by nickname]]\n* [[Lists of nicknames]] \u2013 nickname list articles on Wikipedia\n* [[Lists of nicknames in association football]]\n* [[Pet name]]\n* [[Pseudonym]]\n* [[Regimental nicknames of the Canadian Forces]]\n* [[Sobriquet]]\n* [[Synecdoche]]\n* [[Terms of endearment]]\n* [[Victory titles]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{Wiktionary-inline}}\n*{{Commons category-inline|Nicknames}}\n\n{{Personal names}}\n\n[[Category:Nicknames| ]]"}]}}}}
