An ideal differential amplifier would have infinite CMRR; this is not achievable in practice. A high CMRR is required when a differential signal must be amplified in the presence of a possibly large common-mode input. An example is audio transmission over [[balanced line]]s.\n\n== Theory ==\n\nIdeally, a differential amplifier takes the voltages, <math>V_+</math> and <math>V_-</math> on its two inputs and produces an output voltage <math>V_\\mathrm{o}=A_\\mathrm{d}(V_+ - V_-)</math>, where <math>A_\\mathrm{d}</math> is the differential gain. However, the output of a real differential amplifier is better described as\n:<math>V_{\\mathrm{o}} = A_\\mathrm{d} (V_+ - V_-) + \\tfrac{1}{2} A_\\mathrm{cm} (V_+ + V_-)</math>\nwhere <math>A_\\mathrm{cm}</math> is the common-mode gain, which is typically much smaller than the [[differential gain]].\n\nThe CMRR is defined as the ratio of the [[Power (physics)|powers]] of the differential gain over the common-mode gain, measured in positive [[decibel]]s (thus using the [[20 log rule]]):\n:<math>\\mathrm{CMRR} = \\left (\\frac{A_\\mathrm{d}}{|A_\\mathrm{cm}|} \\right) = 10\\log_{10} \\left (\\frac{A_\\mathrm{d}}{A_\\mathrm{cm}} \\right)^2 dB = 20\\log_{10} \\left (\\frac{A_\\mathrm{d}}{|A_\\mathrm{cm}|} \\right) dB</math>\n\nAs differential gain should exceed common-mode gain, this will be a positive number, and the higher the better.\n\nThe CMRR is a very important specification, as it indicates how much of the [[common-mode signal]] will appear in your measurement. The value of the CMRR often depends on signal [[frequency]] as well, and must be specified as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] thereof.\n\nIt is often important in reducing noise on transmission lines.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} For example, when measuring the resistance of a [[thermocouple]] in a noisy environment, the [[signal noise|noise]] from the environment appears as an offset on both input leads, making it a common-mode [[voltage]] signal. The CMRR of the measurement instrument determines the [[attenuation]] applied to the offset or noise.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Signal-to-noise ratio]]\n* [[Balanced line]]\n* [[XLR connector]]\n* [[Tip ring sleeve]]\n\n==External links==\n* [http://pages.emerson.edu/faculty/O/Owen%5FCurtin/Audio_Connectors.htm PowerPoint presentation on audio connectors]\n\n[[Category:Electrical parameters]]\n[[Category:Engineering ratios]]"}]}}}}
