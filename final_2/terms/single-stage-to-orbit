To date, orbital launches have been performed either by [[Multistage rocket|multi-stage]] fully or partially [[Expendable launch system|expendable rocket]]s, the [[Space Shuttle]] having both attributes.\n\nLaunch costs for [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) range from $4500 to $8500 per pound of [[payload]] ($10,000\u2013$19,000 / kg).<ref>\"Space Transportation Costs: Trends in Price Per Pound to Orbit 1990-2000\", Futron, 2002.</ref> Reusable SSTO vehicles offer the promise of reduced launch expenses by eliminating recurring costs associated with hardware replacement inherent in expendable launch systems. However, the nonrecurring costs associated with design, development, research and engineering (DDR&E) of reusable SSTO systems are much higher than expendable systems due to the substantial technical challenges of SSTO.<ref>Dick, Stephen and Lannius, R., \"Critical Issues in the History of Spaceflight,\" NASA Publication SP-2006-4702, 2006.</ref>\n\nIt is considered to be marginally possible to launch a single-stage-to-orbit [[Rocket engine#Chemically powered|chemically-fueled]] spacecraft from Earth. The principal complicating factors for SSTO from Earth are: high orbital velocity of over {{convert|7400|m/s|kph mph}}; the need to overcome Earth's gravity, especially in the early stages of flight; and flight within [[atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]], which limits speed in the early stages of flight and influences engine performance.\n\nNotable single stage to orbit research spacecraft include [[Skylon (spacecraft)|Skylon]], the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-X|DC-X]], the [[Lockheed Martin X-33]], and the [[Rotary Rocket|Roton SSTO]]. However, despite showing some promise, none of them has come close to achieving orbit yet due to problems with finding the most efficient propulsion system.<ref name=vb020511/>\n\nSingle-stage-to-orbit has been achieved from the [[Moon]] by both the [[Apollo program]]'s [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] and several robotic spacecraft of the Soviet [[Luna programme|Luna program]]. This is easily achieved on the Moon due to lower orbital velocity, lower lunar gravity and the absence of any significant atmosphere.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early Concepts===\n[[File:rombus.jpg|right|thumb|250px|ROMBUS concept art]]\nFor a long time before the second half of the twentieth century, the concept of a single stage to orbit vehicle was rarely considered, and when it was it was generally considered to be impractical and therefore very little research was conducted into the concept. However, advancements in flight technology led to the idea becoming more plausible, and during the 1960s some of the first concept designs for this kind of craft began to emerge.\n\nOne of the earliest was the One stage Orbital Space Truck (OOST) designed by [[Philip Bono]],<ref>Philip Bono & Kenneth William Gatland, ''Frontiers Of Space'', ISBN 0-7137-3504-X</ref> an engineer for [[Douglas Aircraft Company]], which was a concept for an expendable booster stage which could deliver a payload to orbit in one stage.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wade|first=Mark |title=OOST|url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/oost.htm |publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica |accessdate=2015-10-18}}</ref> A reusable version named ROOST was also proposed. Another early SSTO design was a reusable launch vehicle named [[NEXUS (rocket)|NEXUS]] which was designed by [[Krafft Arnold Ehricke]] in the early 1960s. It was one of the largest space craft ever conceptualized with a diameter of over fifty metres and the capability to lift up to two thousand short tons into Earth orbit, intended for missions to further out locations in the solar system such as [[Mars]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Aerospace projects Review|volume=3|issue=1|url=http://www.up-ship.com/eAPR/ev3n1.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4221/ch2.htm|title=SP-4221 The Space Shuttle Decision|publisher=NASA History|accessdate=18 October 2015}}</ref> The North American Air Augmented VTOVL from 1963 was a similarly large craft which would have used external burning ramjets to decrease the liftoff mass of the vehicle by removing the need for large amounts of liquid oxygen while travelling through the atmosphere.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/norvtovl.htm|title=Encyclopedia Astronautica - North American Air Augmented VTOVL|accessdate=18 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1965, Robert Salked investigated various single stage to orbit spaceplane concepts, which would include wings. He proposed a vehicle which would burn hydrocarbon fuel while in the atmosphere and then switch to hydrogen fuel for increasing efficiency once in space.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/saluttle.htm|title=Salkeld Shuttle|work=astronautix.com|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/sld039.htm|title=ROBERT SALKELD'S|work=pmview.com|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.nasa.gov/sts25th/printFriendly/further.html|title=STS-1 Further Reading|work=nasa.gov|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref> This was around the same time as the development of the [[space shuttle]].\n\nFurther examples of Bono's early concepts (prior to the 1990s) which were never constructed include:\n*ROMBUS (Reusable Orbital Module, Booster, and Utility Shuttle), another design from Philip Bono.<ref name=aiaa1963-06>\n{{cite journal |last=Bono|first=Philip|title=ROMBUS - An Integrated Systems Concept for a Reusable Orbital Module/Booster And Utility Shuttle |journal=AIAA |date=June 1963 |issue=AIAA-1963-271 |url=http://www.aiaa.org/content.cfm?pageid=406}}</ref><ref>[http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/rombus.htm Rombus]</ref> This wasn't technically single stage since it dropped some of its initial hydrogen tanks, but it came very close.\n*Ithacus, an adapted ROMBUS concept which was designed to carry soldiers and military equipment to other continents via a sub-orbital trajectory.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bono|first=Philip |title=\"Ithacus\" \u2014 a new concept of inter-continental ballistic transport (ICBT) |journal=AIAA |date=June 1963 |issue=AIAA-1964-280 |url=http://www.aiaa.org/content.cfm?pageid=406}}</ref><ref>[http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/ithacus.htm Ithacus]</ref>\n*Pegasus, another adapted ROMBUS concept designed to carry passengers and payloads long distances in short amounts of time via space.<ref>[http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/pegvtovl.htm Pegasus VTOVL<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*SASSTO, another launch vehicle concept.<ref>[http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/sassto.htm SASSTO<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*Hyperion, yet another Philip Bono concept which used a sled to build up speed before liftoff to save on the amount of fuel which had to be lifted into the air.<ref>[http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/hypnssto.htm Hyperion SSTO]</ref>\n\nAround 1985 the [[Rockwell X-30|NASP]] project was intended to create a scramjet vehicle to reach orbit, but this had its funding stopped and was cancelled.<ref>[http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/x30.htm X-30]</ref> At around the same time, the [[HOTOL]] tried to use [[precooled jet engine]] technology, but failed to show significant advantages over rocket technology.<ref>''Flight international'' 1 March 1986</ref>\n\n===DC-X Technology===\n[[Image:Delta Clipper DC-X first flight.jpg|thumb|right|The first flight of the DC-X]]\n{{Main article|McDonnell Douglas DC-X}}\nThe DC-X, short for Delta Clipper Experimental, was an unmanned one third scale SSTO vehicle which was too small to actually achieve orbit but was instead built to demonstrate vertical takeoff and landing. It is one of only a few prototype SSTO vehicles ever built. Several other prototypes of this design were proposed, including the DC-X2 (a half-scale prototype) and the DC-Y, a full scale vehicle which would be capable of single stage insertion into orbit. Neither of these were built, but the project was taken over by [[NASA]] in 1995, and they built the DC-XA, an upgraded one third scale prototype. This vehicle was lost when it landed with only three of its four landing pads deployed, which caused it to tip over on its side and explode. The project has not been continued since.\n\nDespite this failure, several future proposals have been based on the DC-X design.\n\n===Roton===\n{{Main article|Rotary Rocket}}\nFrom 1999 to 2001 Rotary Rocket attempted to build a SSTO vehicle called the Roton. It received a large amount of media attention and a working sub-scale prototype was completed, but the design was largely impractical.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.05/roton.html|title=Wired 4.05: Insanely Great? or Just Plain Insane?|work=wired.com|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Approaches==\n\nThere have been various approaches to SSTO, including pure rockets that are launched and land vertically, air-breathing [[scramjet]]-powered vehicles that are launched and land horizontally, [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|nuclear-powered]] vehicles, and even [[Reaction Engines Skylon|jet-engine]]-powered vehicles that can fly into orbit and return landing like an airliner, completely intact.\n\nFor rocket-powered SSTO, the main challenge is achieving a high enough mass-ratio to carry sufficient [[propellant]] to achieve [[orbit]], plus a meaningful [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]] weight.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} One possibility is to give the rocket an initial speed with a [[space gun]], as planned in the [[Quicklaunch]] project.\n\nFor air-breathing SSTO, the main challenge is system complexity and associated [[research and development]] costs, [[material science]], and construction techniques necessary for surviving sustained high-speed flight within the atmosphere, ''and'' achieving a high enough mass-ratio to carry sufficient propellant to achieve orbit, plus a meaningful payload weight. Air-breathing designs typically fly at [[supersonic]] or [[hypersonic]] speeds, and usually include a rocket engine for the final burn for orbit.<ref name=vb020511/>\n\nWhether rocket-powered or air-breathing, a reusable vehicle must be rugged enough to survive multiple round trips into space without adding excessive weight or maintenance. In addition a reusable vehicle must be able to reenter without damage, and land safely.\n\nWhile single-stage rockets were once thought to be beyond reach, advances in materials technology and construction techniques have shown them to be possible. For example, calculations show that the [[LGM-25C Titan II|Titan II]] first stage, launched on its own, would have a 25-to-1 ratio of fuel to vehicle hardware.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.braeunig.us/space/specs/titan.htm\n| title = The titan family\n| accessdate = 2009-09-14\n}}</ref>\nIt has a sufficiently efficient engine to achieve orbit, but without carrying much payload.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.erps.org/?p=321\n| title = A LO2/Kerosene SSTO Rocket Design\n| author = Mitchell Burnside-Clapp\n| date = February 1997\n| accessdate = 2009-09-14\n}}</ref>\n\n==Design challenges inherent in SSTO==\n\nThe design space constraints of SSTO vehicles were described by rocket design engineer [[Robert Truax]]:\n\n{{Quote box\n|quote = Using similar technologies (i.e., the same propellants and structural fraction), a two-stage-to-orbit vehicle will always have a better payload-to-weight ratio than a single stage designed for the same mission, in most cases, a very much better [payload-to-weight ratio]. Only when the structural factor approaches zero [very little vehicle structure weight] does the payload/weight ratio of a single-stage rocket approach that of a two-stage. A slight miscalculation and the single-stage rocket winds up with no payload. To get any at all, technology needs to be stretched to the limit.

Print.</ref> reusable SSTO vehicles are typically an impractical choice even when using the highest performance propellants available.\n\n==Dense versus hydrogen fuels==\n[[Hydrogen]] might seem the obvious fuel for SSTO vehicles. When burned with [[oxygen]], hydrogen gives the highest [[specific impulse]] of any commonly used fuel: around 450 seconds, compared with up to 350 seconds for [[kerosene]].\n\nHydrogen has the following advantages:\n\n* Hydrogen has nearly 30% higher specific impulse (about 450 seconds vs. 350 seconds) than most dense fuels.\n* Hydrogen is an excellent coolant.\n* The gross mass of hydrogen stages is lower than dense-fuelled stages for the same payload.\n* Hydrogen is environmentally friendly.\n\nHowever, hydrogen also has these disadvantages:\n\n* Very low density (about 1/7 of the density of kerosene) \u2014 requiring a very large tank\n* Deeply [[cryogenic]] \u2014 must be stored at very low temperatures and thus needs heavy insulation\n* Escapes very easily from the smallest gap\n* Wide combustible range \u2014 easily ignited and burns with a dangerously invisible flame\n* Tends to condense oxygen which can cause flammability problems\n* Has a large [[coefficient of expansion]] for even small heat leaks.\n\nThese issues can be dealt with, but at extra cost.\n\nWhile kerosene tanks can be 1% of the weight of their contents, hydrogen tanks often must weigh 10% of their contents. This is because of both the low density and the additional insulation required to minimize boiloff (a problem which does not occur with kerosene and many other fuels). The low density of hydrogen further affects the design of the rest of the vehicle \u2014 pumps and pipework need to be much larger in order to pump the fuel to the engine. The end result is the thrust/weight ratio of hydrogen-fueled engines is 30\u201350% lower than comparable engines using denser fuels.\n\nThis inefficiency indirectly affects [[gravity drag|gravity losses]] as well; the vehicle has to hold itself up on rocket power until it reaches orbit. The lower excess thrust of the hydrogen engines due to the lower thrust/weight ratio means that the vehicle must ascend more steeply, and so less thrust acts horizontally. Less horizontal thrust results in taking longer to reach orbit, and gravity losses are increased by at least {{convert|300|m/s|kph mph}}. While not appearing large, the mass ratio to [[delta-v]] curve is very steep to reach orbit in a single stage, and this makes a 10% difference to the mass ratio on top of the tankage and pump savings.\n\nThe overall effect is that there is surprisingly little difference in overall performance between SSTOs that use hydrogen and those that use denser fuels, except that hydrogen vehicles may be rather more expensive to develop and buy. Careful studies have shown that some dense fuels (for example liquid [[propane]]) exceed the performance of hydrogen fuel when used in an SSTO launch vehicle by 10% for the same dry weight.<ref>{{cite web\n | url= http://www.dunnspace.com/alternate_ssto_propellants.htm\n | title= Alternate Propellants for SSTO Launchers\n |author= Dr. Bruce Dunn |date= 1996 \n | accessdate= 2007-11-15\n}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s [[Philip Bono]] investigated single-stage, VTVL [[tripropellant rocket]]s, and showed that it could improve payload size by around 30%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/fam/vtovl.htm|title=VTOVL|work=astronautix.com|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nOperational experience with the [[DC-X]] experimental rocket has caused a number of SSTO advocates to reconsider hydrogen as a satisfactory fuel. The late Max Hunter, while employing hydrogen fuel in the DC-X, often said that he thought the first successful orbital SSTO would more likely be fueled by propane.\n\n==One engine for all altitudes==\nSome SSTO vehicles use the same engine for all altitudes, which is a problem for traditional engines with a bell-shaped [[nozzle]]. Depending on the atmospheric pressure, different bell shapes are optimal. Engines operating in the lower atmosphere have shorter bells than those designed to work in vacuum. Having a bell that is only optimal at a single altitude lowers the overall engine efficiency.\n\nOne possible solution would be to use an [[aerospike engine]], which can be effective in a wide range of ambient pressures. In fact, a linear aerospike engine was used in the X-33 design.\n\nOther solutions involve using multiple engines and other [[altitude compensating nozzle|altitude adapting designs]] such as double-mu bells or [[expanding nozzle|extensible bell sections]].\n\nStill, at very high altitudes, the extremely large engine bells tend to expand the exhaust gases down to near vacuum pressures. As a result, these engine bells are counterproductive due to their excess weight. Some SSTO vehicles simply use very high pressure engines which permit high ratios to be used from ground level. This gives good performance, negating the need for more complex solutions.\n\n==Airbreathing SSTO==\n\nSome designs for SSTO attempt to use [[airbreathing jet engine]]s that collect oxidizer and reaction mass from the atmosphere to reduce the take-off weight of the vehicle.\n\nSome of the issues with this approach are:\n\n* No known air breathing engine is capable of operating at orbital speed within the atmosphere (for example hydrogen fueled [[scramjet]]s seem to have a top speed of about Mach&nbsp;17).<ref>{{cite web\n | url= http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/x30.htm\n | title= X-30\n |author= Mark Wade |date= 2007 \n |accessdate= 2007-11-15\n}}</ref> This means that rockets must be used for the final orbital insertion.\n* Rocket thrust needs the orbital mass to be as small as possible to minimize propellant weight.\n* The thrust-to-weight ratio of rockets that rely on on-board oxygen increases dramatically as fuel is expended, because the oxidizer fuel tank has about 1% of the mass as the oxidizer it carries, whereas air-breathing engines traditionally have a poor thrust/weight ratio which is relatively fixed during the air-breathing ascent.\n* Very high speeds in the atmosphere necessitate very heavy thermal protection systems, which makes reaching orbit even harder.\n* While at lower speeds, air-breathing engines are very efficient, but the efficiency ([[Specific impulse|Isp]]) and thrust levels of air-breathing jet engines drop considerably at high speed (above Mach 5\u201310 depending on the engine) and begin to approach that of rocket engines or worse.\n* [[Lift to drag ratio]]s of vehicles at hypersonic speeds are poor whereas since acceleration is a vector, the effective lift to drag ratios of rocket vehicles at high g is [[gravity drag|not dissimilar]].\n\nThus with for example scramjet designs (e.g. [[NASA X-43|X-43]]) the mass budgets do not seem to close for orbital launch.\n\nSimilar issues occur with single-stage vehicles attempting to carry conventional jet engines to orbit\u2014the weight of the jet engines is not compensated sufficiently by the reduction in propellant.<ref name=sstovarvill>{{cite web\n | url= http://www.reactionengines.co.uk/downloads/JBIS_v56_108-117.pdf\n | title= A Comparison of Propulsions Concepts for SSTO Reusable launchers\n |author= Richard Varvill\n |author2= Alan Bond\n |last-author-amp= yes \n | date= 2003 |format= PDF |publisher= ''[[Journal of the British Interplanetary Society]]'' |pages=108\u2013117 |volume= 56\n |accessdate= 2007-11-15 }}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, LACE-like [[precooled jet engine|precooled airbreathing]] designs such as the [[Reaction Engines Skylon|Skylon spaceplane]] (and [[ATREX]]) which transition to rocket thrust at rather lower speeds (Mach&nbsp;5.5) do seem to give, on paper at least, an improved orbital [[Propellant mass fraction|mass fraction]] over pure rockets (even multistage rockets) sufficiently to hold out the possibility of full reusability with better payload fraction.<ref>Cimino, P.; Drake, J.; Jones, J.; Strayer, D.; Venetoklis, P.: [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1985STIA...8726190C \"Transatmospheric vehicle propelled by air-turborocket engines\"], ''AIAA, Joint Propulsion Conference, 21st, Monterey, CA, July 8\u201311, 1985. 10 p. Research supported by the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.'', 07/1985</ref>\n\nIt is important to note that mass fraction is an important concept in the engineering of a rocket. However, mass fraction may have little to do with the costs of a rocket, as the costs of fuel are very small when compared to the costs of the engineering program as a whole. As a result, a cheap rocket with a poor mass fraction may be able to deliver more payload to orbit with a given amount of money than a more complicated, more efficient rocket.\n\n==Launch assists==\nMany vehicles are only narrowly suborbital, so practically anything that gives a relatively small delta-v increase can be helpful, and outside assistance for a vehicle is therefore desirable.\n\nProposed launch assists include:\n*[[Rocket sled launch|sled launch]] (rail, maglev including [[Rocket sled launch|Bantam, MagLifter]], and [[StarTram]], etc.)\n*[[air launch|aircraft tow]]\n*in-flight fueling\n*[[Lofstrom launch loop]]/[[space fountain]]s\n\nAnd on-orbit resources such as:\n*[[Space tether]]\n*tugs\n\n==Nuclear propulsion==\n{{main article|Nuclear propulsion}}\nDue to weight issues such as shielding, many nuclear propulsion systems are unable to lift their own weight, and hence are unsuitable for launching to orbit. However some designs such as the [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Orion project]] and some [[Nuclear thermal rocket|nuclear thermal]] designs do have a [[thrust to weight ratio]] in excess of&nbsp;1, enabling them to lift off. Clearly one of the main issues with nuclear propulsion would be safety, both during a launch for the passengers, but also in case of a failure during launch. No current program is attempting nuclear propulsion from Earth's surface.\n\n==Beam-powered propulsion==\n{{main article|Beam-powered propulsion}}\nBecause they can be more energetic than the potential energy that chemical fuel allows for, some laser or microwave powered rocket concepts have the potential to launch vehicles into orbit, single stage. In practice, this area is relatively undeveloped, and current technology falls far short of this.\n\n==Comparison with the Shuttle==\nThe high cost per launch of the [[Space Shuttle]] sparked interest throughout the 1980s in designing a cheaper successor vehicle. Several official design studies were done, but most were basically smaller versions of the existing Shuttle concept.\n\nMost cost analysis studies of the Space Shuttle have shown that workforce is by far the single greatest expense. Early shuttle discussions speculated airliner-type operation, with a two-week turnaround. However, senior NASA planners envisioned no more than 10 to 12 flights per year for the entire shuttle fleet. The absolute maximum flights per year for the entire fleet was limited by external tank manufacturing capacity to 24 per year.<ref>{{cite web\n | url= http://caib.nasa.gov/events/public_hearings/20030423/transcript_am.html\n | title= Columbia Accident Investigation Board\n |date= 23 April 2003 |publisher= [[NASA]] \n |accessdate= 2007-11-15\n}}</ref>\n\nVery efficient (hence complex and sophisticated) [[Space Shuttle Main Engine|main engines]] were required to fit within the available vehicle space. Likewise the only known suitable lightweight [[Space shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection]] was delicate, maintenance-intensive [[silica]] tiles. These and other design decisions resulted in a vehicle that requires great maintenance after every mission. The engines are removed and inspected, and prior to the new \"block&nbsp;II\" main engines, the [[turbopump]]s were removed, disassembled and rebuilt. While [[Space Shuttle Atlantis]] was refurbished and relaunched in 53&nbsp;days between missions [[STS-51-J]] and [[STS-61-B]], generally months were required to repair an orbiter for a new mission.\n\nMany in the aerospace community{{Who|date=January 2009}} concluded that an entirely self-contained, reusable single-stage vehicle could solve these problems. The idea behind such a vehicle is to reduce the processing requirements from those of the Shuttle.\n\n==Examples==\nIt is easier to achieve SSTO from a body with lower gravitational pull than Earth, such as the [[Moon]] or [[Mars]]. The [[Apollo Lunar Module]] ascended from the lunar surface to lunar orbit in a single stage.\n\nA detailed study into SSTO vehicles was prepared by [[Chrysler Corporation]]'s Space Division in 1970\u20131971 under NASA contract NAS8-26341. Their proposal ([[Shuttle SERV]]) was an enormous vehicle with more than {{convert|50000|kg}} of payload, utilizing [[jet engine]]s for (vertical) landing.<ref>{{cite web\n | url= http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/shuttle.htm\n | title= Shuttle SERV\n | author= Mark Wade | date= 2007 \n | accessdate= 2010-04-01\n}}</ref> While the technical problems seemed to be solvable, the [[United States Air Force|USAF]] required a winged design that led to the Shuttle as we know it today.\n\nThe unmanned [[DC-X]] technology demonstrator, originally developed by [[McDonnell Douglas]] for the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI) program office, was an attempt to build a vehicle that could lead to an SSTO vehicle. The one-third-size test craft was operated and maintained by a small team of three people based out of a trailer, and the craft was once relaunched less than 24&nbsp;hours after landing. Although the test program was not without mishap (including a minor explosion), the DC-X demonstrated that the maintenance aspects of the concept were sound. That project was cancelled when it landed with three of four legs deployed, tipped over, and exploded on the fourth flight after transferring management from the [[Strategic Defense Initiative Organization]] to NASA.\n\nThe [[Aquarius Launch Vehicle]] was designed to bring bulk materials to orbit as cheaply as possible.\n\n==Current development==\nCurrent and previous SSTO projects include the Japanese [[Kankoh-maru]] project, the [[Reaction Engines Skylon|Skylon]], Haas 2C, and the Indian [[Avatar (spacecraft)|Avatar]] spaceplane.\n\n===Skylon===\n{{main article|Reaction Engines Skylon}}\nThe British Government partnered with the [[ESA]] in 2010 to promote a [[single-stage to orbit]] [[spaceplane]] concept called [[Skylon (spacecraft)|Skylon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parabolicarc.com/2010/09/22/uksa-reviews-skylon-sabre/|title=UKSA Reviews Skylon and SABRE at Parabolic Arc|work=parabolicarc.com|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref> This design was pioneered by [[Reaction Engines Limited|Reaction Engines Limited (REL)]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reactionengines.co.uk/faq.html#q6|title=Reaction Engines Ltd - Frequently Asked Questions|work=reactionengines.co.uk|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ukspaceagency.bis.gov.uk/19661.aspx]</ref> a company founded by [[Alan Bond (engineer)|Alan Bond]] after [[HOTOL]] was canceled.<ref name=\"ReactionEngines1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.reactionengines.co.uk/|title=Reaction Engines Limited|work=reactionengines.co.uk|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref> The Skylon spaceplane has been positively received by the British government, and the [[British Interplanetary Society]].<ref name=gh220211>{{cite web |url=http://theglobalherald.com/space-the-development-of-single-stage-space-flight/11656/ |title= SSTO spaceplane is coming to Great Britain|author=Robert Parkinson |date= 2011-02-22|work=Space:The Development of Single Stage Flight |publisher=The Global Herald |accessdate=28 February 2011}}</ref> Following a successful propulsion system test that was audited by ESA's propulsion division in mid-2012, REL announced that it would begin a three-and-a-half-year project to develop and build a test jig of the [[SABRE (rocket engine)|Sabre engine]] to prove the engines performance across its air-breathing and rocket modes.<ref name=November2012Test>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-20510112|title=Skylon spaceplane engine concept achieves key milestone|publisher=BBC|date=28 November 2012|accessdate=28 November 2012}}</ref> In November 2012, it was announced that a key test of the engine precooler had been successfully completed, and that ESA had verified the precooler's design.

''The Register''. 29 November 2012.</ref>\n\n==Alternative approaches to inexpensive spaceflight==\nMany studies have shown that regardless of selected technology, the most effective cost reduction technique is [[economies of scale]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Merely launching a large total quantity reduces the manufacturing costs per vehicle, similar to how the [[mass production]] of automobiles brought about great increases in affordability.\n\nUsing this concept, some aerospace analysts believe the way to lower launch costs is the exact opposite of SSTO. Whereas reusable SSTOs would reduce per launch costs by making a reusable high-tech vehicle that launches frequently with low maintenance, the \"mass production\" approach views the technical advances as a source of the cost problem in the first place. By simply building and launching large quantities of rockets, and hence launching a large volume of payload, costs can be brought down. This approach was attempted in the late 1970s, early 1980s in [[West Germany]] with the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]-based [[OTRAG]] [[OTRAG Rocket|rocket]].\n\nA related idea is to obtain economies of scale from building simple, massive, multi-stage rockets using cheap, off-the-shelf parts. The vehicles would be dumped into the ocean after use. This strategy is known as the \"[[big dumb booster]]\" approach.\n\nThis is somewhat similar to the approach some previous systems have taken, using simple engine systems with \"low-tech\" fuels, as the [[Russian Space Agency|Russian]] and [[China National Space Administration|Chinese space program]]s still do. These nations' launches are significantly cheaper than their Western counterparts.\n\nAn alternative to scale is to make the discarded stages practically reusable: this is the goal of the [[SpaceX reusable launch system development program]] and its Grasshopper demonstrator.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Aerospike engine]]\n* [[AVATAR (spacecraft)]]\n* [[Bristol Spaceplanes]]\n* [[HOTOL]]\n* [[Kankoh-maru]]\n* [[Launch loop]]\n* [[Propellant mass fraction|Mass fraction]]\n* [[Orbital ring]]\n* [[Rotary Rocket|Roton]]\n* [[Scramjet]]\n* [[Space Elevator]]\n* [[Spacecraft propulsion]]\n* [[Two-stage-to-orbit]]\n* [[Three-stage-to-orbit]]\n* [[VentureStar]]\n* [[X-30]]\n* [[X-33]]\n* [[X-43A]]\n* [[XS-1 (spacecraft)|XS-1]]\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Andrew J.
