Math. Phys. vol. 74, pp. 189\u2013197 1980</ref> These (type I, II and III) correspond to the approach to a [[saddle-node bifurcation]], a subcritical [[Hopf bifurcation]], or an inverse [[period-doubling bifurcation]]. In the apparently periodic phases the behaviour is only nearly periodic, slowly drifting away from an unstable [[periodic orbit]]. Eventually the system gets far enough away from the periodic orbit to be affected by chaotic dynamics in the rest of the [[state space]], until it gets close to the orbit again and returns to the nearly periodic behaviour. Since the time spent near the periodic orbit depends sensitively on how closely the system entered its vicinity (in turn determined by what happened during the chaotic period) the length of each phase is unpredictable.\n\nAnother kind, on-off intermittency, occurs when a previously transversally stable chaotic attractor with dimension less than the embedding space begins to lose stability. Near unstable orbits within the attractor orbits can escape into the surrounding space, producing a temporary burst before returning to the attractor. <ref>E.Ott and J.C. Sommerer, Blowout bifurcations: the occurrence of riddled basins and on-off intermittency, Physics Letters A, vol. 188, 1994, pp. 39\u201347</ref>\n\nIn crisis-induced intermittency a chaotic attractor suffers a [[Crisis_(dynamical_systems)|crisis]], where two or more attractors cross the boundaries of each other's [[basin of attraction]]. As an orbit moves through the first attractor it can cross over the boundary and become attracted to the second attractor, where it will stay until its dynamics moves it across the boundary again.\n\nIntermittent behaviour is commonly observed in fluid flows that are [[turbulent]] or near the transition to turbulence.   In highly [[turbulent]] flows, intermittency is seen in the irregular dissipation of kinetic energy.  It is also seen in the irregular alternation between turbulent and non-turbulent fluid that appear in turbulent [[jet (fluid)|jets]] and other turbulent free shear flows.  In [[pipe flow]] and other wall bounded shear flows, there are intermittent puffs that are central to the process of transition from laminar to turbulent flow.   Intermittent behavior has also been experimentally demonstrated in circuit oscillators and chemical reactions.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Crisis (dynamical systems)]]\n*[[Turbulence|Turbulent flow]]\n*[[Fluorescence intermittency]] (blinking) of organic molecules and colloidal quantum dots (nanocrystals)\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{cite book\n | last= Staicu |first=A.
