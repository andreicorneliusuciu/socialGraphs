These features and the vehicles employing them may be labeled as ''intelligent'' or ''smart''. A vehicle using automation for difficult tasks, especially navigation, may be referred to as ''semi-autonomous''. A vehicle relying solely on automation is consequently referred to as [[robotic]] or [[autonomous]]. After the invention of the [[integrated circuit]], the sophistication of [[automation]] technology increased. Manufacturers and researchers subsequently added a variety of automated functions to automobiles and other vehicles.\n\n==Ground vehicles==\n{{Further information|Unmanned ground vehicles}}\nGround vehicles employing automation and [[teleoperation]] include shipyard gantries, mining trucks, bomb-disposal robots, robotic insects, and [[driverless tractor]]s.\n\nThere are a lot of autonomous and semi-autonomous ground vehicles being made for the purpose of transporting passengers. One such example is the free-ranging on grid ([[:nl:Free Ranging On Grid|FROG]]) technology which consists of autonomous vehicles, a magnetic track and a supervisory system. The FROG system is deployed for industrial purposes in factory sites and has been in used since 1999 on the ''[[ParkShuttle]]'',<ref name=\"rijnmondsept11\">{{cite news | url=http://www.rtvrijnmond.nl/Homepage/Nieuws?view=/News%2FDefault%2F2011%2Fseptember%2FParkshuttle%20gaat%20weer%20rijden | title=\u2018Parkshuttle gaat weer rijden\u2019 | work=RTV Rijnmond | date=September 1, 2021 | accessdate=October 11, 2011|language=nl}}</ref> a [[personal rapid transit|PRT]]-style public transport system in the city of [[Capelle aan den IJssel]] to connect the Rivium business park with the neighboring city of [[Rotterdam]] (where the route terminates at the [[Kralingse Zoom]] metro station). The system experienced a crash in 2005<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wolfstad.com/2005/12/driveless-robot-busses-crash/ |title=Driverless robot buses crash < Life in Holland, News, Science & technology < Wolfstad Blog |publisher=Wolfstad.com |date=2005-12-06 |accessdate=2011-11-20}}</ref> that proved to be caused by a human error.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wolfstad.com/2005/12/driverless-robot-buses-crash-part-2/ |title=Driverless robot buses crash, Part 2 < Life in Holland, News, Science & technology < Wolfstad Blog |publisher=Wolfstad.com |date=2005-12-17 |accessdate=2011-11-20}}</ref>\n\nApplications for automation in ground vehicles include the following:\n* [[Vehicle tracking system]] system ESITrack, [[Lojack]]\n* Rear-view alarm, to detect obstacles behind.\n* [[Anti-lock braking system]] (ABS) (also Emergency Braking Assistance ([[Emergency brake assist|EBA]])), often coupled with [[Electronic brake force distribution]] (EBD), which prevents the brakes from locking and losing traction while braking. This shortens stopping distances in most cases and, more importantly, allows the driver to steer the vehicle while braking.\n* [[Traction control system]] (TCS) actuates brakes or reduces throttle to restore traction if driven wheels begin to spin.\n* [[Four wheel drive]] (AWD) with a centre differential. Distributing power to all four wheels lessens the chances of wheel spin. It also suffers less from [[oversteer]] and [[understeer]].\n* [[Electronic Stability Control]] (ESC) (also known for [[Mercedes-Benz]] proprietary Electronic Stability Program (ESP), [[Acceleration Slip Regulation]] (ASR) and Electronic differential lock (EDL)). Uses various sensors to intervene when the car senses a possible loss of control. The car's control unit can reduce power from the engine and even apply the brakes on individual wheels to prevent the car from [[understeer]]ing or [[oversteer]]ing.\n* [[Dynamic steering response]] (DSR) corrects the rate of [[power steering]] system to adapt it to vehicle's speed and road conditions.\n\nResearch is ongoing and prototypes of autonomous ground vehicles exist.\n\n===Cars===\n{{See also|Autonomous car}}\nExtensive automation for cars focuses on either introducing [[robotic cars]] or modifying modern car designs to be semi-autonomous. Semi-autonomous designs could be implemented sooner as they rely less on technology that is still at the forefront of research. An example is the Dual mode monorail. Groups such as [[Dual-mode transit|RUF]] (Denmark), BiWay (UK), [[ATN]] (New Zealand) and TriTrack (USA) are working on projects consisting of private cars that dock onto monorail tracks and are driven autonomously.\nAs a method of automating cars without extensively modifying the cars as much as a [[robotic car]], [[Automated highway system]]s (AHS) aims to construct lanes on highways that would be equipped with, for example, magnets to guide the vehicles. Automation vehicles have auto-brakes named as Auto Vehicles Braking System (AVBS). Highway computers would manage the traffic and direct the cars to avoid crashes.\n\nThe [[European Commission]] has established a smart car development program called the ''Intelligent Car Flagship Initiative''.<ref>[http://auto.ihs.com/news/eu-en-intelligent-cars-faq.htm IHS Automotive News, February 23, 2006, accessed October 9, 2006]</ref>  The goals of that program include:\n\n* [[Autonomous Cruise Control]]\n* [[Lane departure warning system]]\n* Project AWAKE for drowsy drivers\n\nThere are plenty of further uses for automation in relation to cars. These include:\n\n* [[Assured Clear Distance Ahead]]\n* [[Adaptive cruise control]]\n* [[Headlamp#Advanced front-lighting system (AFS)|Adaptive headlamps]]\n* [[Advanced Automatic Collision Notification]], such as [[OnStar]]\n* [[Intelligent Parking Assist System]]\n* [[Automatic Parking]]\n* [[Automotive night vision]] with pedestrian detection\n* [[Blind spot monitoring]]\n* [[Driver Monitoring System]]\n* [[Robotic car]] or self-driving car which may result in less-stressed \"drivers\", higher efficiency (the driver can do something else), increased safety and less [[pollution]] (e.g. via completely automated [[gasoline|fuel]] control)\n* [[Precrash system]]\n* [[Assured Clear Distance Ahead|Safe speed governing]]\n* [[Traffic sign recognition]]\n* Following another car on a motorway \u2013 \"enhanced\" or \"adaptive\" cruise control, as used by Ford and Vauxhall<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/news/autoexpressnews/62349/vauxhall_vectra.html |title=Vauxhall Vectra &#124; Auto Express News &#124; News |publisher=Auto Express |date=2005-11-29 |accessdate=2011-11-20}}</ref>\n* Distance control assist \u2013 as developed by Nissan<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/NEWS/2006/_STORY/060315-01-e.html |title=Nissan &#124; News Press Release |publisher=Nissan-global.com |date=2006-03-15 |accessdate=2011-11-20}}</ref>\n* [[Dead man's switch]] \u2013 there is a move to introduce [[deadman's braking]] into automotive application, primarily heavy vehicles, and there may also be a need to add [[penalty switch]]es to [[cruise control]]s.\n\n===Trucks===\nThe concept for autonomous vehicles has also been applied for commercial uses, like for autonomous or nearly autonomous trucks. As recorded in June 1995 in [[Popular Science Magazine]], self-driving trucks were being developed for combat convoys, whereby only the lead truck would be driven by a human and the following trucks would rely on satellite, an inertial guidance system and ground-speed sensors.<ref name=\"PopularScienceJune1995\">{{cite magazine|last1=Nelson|first1=Ray|title=Leave The Driving To Us|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KrfIjdl-EMwC&pg=PA26&dq=self-driving+trucks&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi81ZbR06jNAhVKV1IKHdNODncQ6AEIOjAB#v=onepage&q=self-driving%20trucks&f=false|date=June 1995|publisher=Popular Science|page=26}}</ref> [[Caterpillar Inc.]] made early developments in 2013 with the [[Robotics Institute]] at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] to improve efficiency and reduce cost at various mining and construction sites.<ref name=\"Gingrich2014\">{{cite book|last1=Gingrich|first1=Newt|title=Breakout: Pioneers of the Future, Prison Guards of the Past, and the Epic Battle That Will Decide America's Fate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1SAjBQAAQBAJ&lpg=PA114&dq=self-driving%20truck&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q=self-driving%20truck&f=false|date=7 October 2014|publisher=Regnery Publishing|isbn=978-1621572817|page=114}}</ref> Companies such as [[Suncor Energy]], a Canadian energy company, and [[Rio Tinto Group]] were among the first to replace human-operated trucks with driverless commercial trucks run by computers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-10-31/suncor-seeks-cost-cutting-with-robot-trucks-in-oil-sands-mine |title=Suncor Seeks Cost Cutting With Robot Trucks in Oil-Sands Mine |publisher=Bloomberg-.com |date=2013-10-13 |accessdate=2016-06-14}}</ref> In April 2016, trucks from major manufacturers including [[Volvo]] and the [[Daimler Company]] completed a week of  autonomous driving across Europe, organized by the Dutch, in an effort to get self-driving trucks on the road.

They are most often used in industrial applications to move materials around a manufacturing facility or warehouse. Application of the automatic guided vehicle has broadened during the late 20th century.\n\n==Aircraft==\n{{Main article|Unmanned aerial vehicle}}\nAircraft has received much attention for automation, especially for navigation. A system capable of autonomously navigating a vehicle (especially aircraft) is known as [[autopilot]].\n\n==Watercraft==\n\n{{main article|Unmanned surface vehicle}}\nAutonomous boats can provide security, do research, or perform hazardous or repetitive tasks (such as guiding a large ship into a harbor or transporting cargo).\n\n==Submersibles==\nUnderwater vehicles have been a focus for automation for tasks such as pipeline inspection and underwater mapping. See [[Autonomous underwater vehicle]].\n\n==Trains==\nAn example of an automated train is the [[Docklands Light Railway]] in [[London]].\n\n==Limitations==\nOne of the current limitations for vehicular automation is the electrical power required to run the processors.<ref>[http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/nvidia-receives-darpa-contract-worth-up-20-million-high-performance-embedded-processor-nasdaq-nvda-1736756.htm \"NVIDIA Receives DARPA Contract Worth up to $20 Million for High-Performance Embedded Processor Research.\"]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Intelligent speed adaptation]]\n* [[Intelligent Transportation System]]\n* [[PReVENT]]\n* [[Uncrewed vehicle]]\n* [[Transit media]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/intelligentcar/index_en.htm European Commission Intelligent Car website]\n* [http://www.its.dot.gov/automated_vehicle/index.htm U.S. Department of Transportation - Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office website]\n\n[[Category:Unmanned ground vehicles]]\n[[Category:Car safety]]"}]}}}}
