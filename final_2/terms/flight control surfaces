Early efforts at [[fixed-wing aircraft]] design succeeded in generating sufficient lift to get the aircraft off the ground, but once aloft, the aircraft proved uncontrollable, often with disastrous results. The development of effective flight controls is what allowed stable flight.\n\nThis article describes the control surfaces used on a fixed-wing aircraft of conventional design.  Other fixed-wing aircraft configurations may use different control surfaces but the basic principles remain.  The controls (stick and [[rudder]]) for rotary wing aircraft ([[helicopter]] or [[autogyro]]) accomplish the same motions about the [[aircraft principal axes|three axes of rotation]], but manipulate the rotating flight controls (main rotor disk and tail rotor disk) in a completely different manner.\n\n==Development ==\n\nThe [[Wright brothers]] are credited with developing the first practical control surfaces.  It is a main part of their patent on flying.<ref>'''Patents'''\n* {{US patent|821393}} \u2014 ''Flying machine'' \u2014 O. & W. Wright\n* [http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT821393&id=h5NWAAAAEBAJ&dq=821,393 U.S. Patent 821,393]\u2014for those who do not have USPTO graphics plugin</ref>  Unlike modern control surfaces, they used [[wing warping]].<ref>*[http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Dictionary/wing_warping/DI56.htm Centennial of flight] - illustration of Wilbur Wright invention of wing warping using a cardboard box</ref>  In an attempt to circumvent the [[Wright brothers patent war| Wright patent]], [[Glenn Curtiss]] made hinged control surfaces, the same type of concept [[M. P. W. Boulton#Later years: career, publications and scientific works|first patented some four decades earlier in the United Kingdom]]. Hinged control surfaces have the advantage of not causing stresses that are a problem of wing warping and are easier to build into structures.\n\n===Axes of motion===\n{{main|Aircraft principal axes}}\n\n[[File:Flight dynamics with text.png|thumb|right||Rotation around the three axes|alt=\"pitch\" is a nose-up/nose-down rotation, \"roll\" is a rotation lifting one wing and lowering the other, \"yaw\" rotation moves the nose in a left/right direction]]\nAn aircraft is free to rotate around three axes that are perpendicular to each other and intersect at its [[center of gravity]] (CG). To control position and direction a pilot must be able to control rotation about each of them.\n\n===Lateral axis===\nThe '''lateral axis''', also known as '''transverse axis''',<ref name=MISB>{{cite web|title=MISB Standard 0601|url=http://www.gwg.nga.mil/misb//docs/standards/ST0601.8.pdf|publisher=Motion Imagery Standards Board (MISB)|accessdate=1 May 2015}} Also at [[:File:MISB Standard 0601.pdf]].</ref> passes through an aircraft from wingtip to wingtip. Rotation about this axis is called '''pitch'''. Pitch changes the vertical direction that the aircraft's nose is pointing. The [[Elevator (aeronautics)|elevators]] are the primary control surfaces for pitch.\n\n===Longitudinal axis===\nThe longitudinal axis passes through the aircraft from nose to tail. Rotation about this axis is called '''roll'''.<ref name=MISB/>  The angular displacement about this axis is called bank.<ref>Clancy, ''L.J. Aerodynamics'', Section 16.6</ref> The pilot changes bank angle by increasing the lift on one wing and decreasing it on the other.  This differential lift causes rotation around the longitudinal axis.  The [[ailerons]] are the primary control of bank. The [[rudder]] also has a secondary effect on bank.\n\n===Vertical axis===\nThe vertical axis passes through an aircraft from top to bottom.  Rotation about this axis is called '''yaw'''.<ref name=MISB/>  Yaw changes the direction the aircraft's nose is pointing, left or right. The primary control of yaw is with the rudder. Ailerons also have a secondary effect on yaw.\n\nIt is important to note that these axes move with the aircraft, and change relative to the earth as the aircraft moves. For example, for an aircraft whose left wing is pointing straight down, its \"vertical\" axis is parallel with the ground, while its \"lateral\" axis is perpendicular to the ground.\n\n==Main control surfaces==\nThe main control surfaces of a [[fixed-wing aircraft]] are attached to the airframe on hinges or tracks so they may move and thus deflect the air stream passing over them.  This redirection of the air stream generates an unbalanced force to rotate the plane about the associated axis.\n[[File:Boeing 727 flight control surfaces.svg|thumb|700px|center|Flight control surfaces of Boeing 727]]\n\n===Ailerons===\n{{main|Aileron}}\n[[File:Alieron A-44 (PSF).png|thumb|right|Aileron surface]]\n[[Ailerons]] are mounted on the trailing edge of each wing near the wingtips and move in opposite directions. When the pilot moves the [[Joystick|stick]] left, or turns the wheel counter-clockwise, the left aileron goes up and the right aileron goes down. A raised aileron reduces lift on that wing and a lowered one increases lift, so moving the stick left causes the left wing to drop and the right wing to rise. This causes the aircraft to roll to the left and begin to turn to the left. Centering the stick returns the ailerons to neutral maintaining the [[Banked turn#Aviation|bank angle]]. The aircraft will continue to turn until opposite aileron motion returns the bank angle to zero to fly straight.\n\n===Elevator===\n{{main|Elevator (aircraft)}}\n\nThe [[Elevator (aircraft)|elevator]] is a moveable part of the [[horizontal stabilizer]], hinged to the back of the fixed part of the horizontal tail. The elevators move up and down together. When the pilot pulls the stick backward, the elevators go up. Pushing the stick forward causes the elevators to go down.  Raised elevators push down on the tail and cause the nose to pitch up. This makes the wings fly at a higher [[angle of attack]], which generates more lift and more [[drag (physics)|drag]].  Centering the stick returns the elevators to neutral and stops the change of pitch.  Many aircraft use a fully moveable horizontal stabilizer called [[stabilator]] or all-moving tail.  Some aircraft, such as an [[MD-80]], use a [[servo tab]] within the elevator surface to aerodynamically move the main surface into position.  The direction of travel of the control tab will thus be in a direction opposite to the main control surface.  It is for this reason that an [[MD-80]] tail looks like it has a 'split' elevator system.\n\nIn the [[canard (aeronautics)|canard arrangement]], the elevators are hinged to the rear of a foreplane and move in the opposite sense, for example when the pilot pulls the stick back the elevators go down to increase the lift at the front and lift the nose up.\n\n===Rudder===\n{{main|Rudder#Aircraft rudders}}\n\nThe [[rudder]] is typically mounted on the trailing edge of the [[vertical stabilizer]], part of the [[empennage]]. When the pilot pushes the left pedal, the rudder deflects left.  Pushing the right pedal causes the rudder to deflect right.  Deflecting the rudder right pushes the tail left and causes the nose to yaw to the right. Centering the rudder pedals returns the rudder to neutral and stops the yaw.\n\n===Secondary effects of controls===\n\n====Ailerons====\n{{Main|Adverse yaw}}\nThe ailerons primarily control roll. Whenever lift is increased, [[induced drag]] is also increased. When the stick is moved left to roll the aircraft to the left, the right aileron is lowered which increases lift on the right wing and therefore increases induced drag on the right wing. Using ailerons causes [[adverse yaw]], meaning the nose of the aircraft yaws in a direction opposite to the aileron application. When moving the stick to the left to bank the wings, adverse yaw moves the nose of the aircraft to the ''right''.  Adverse yaw is more pronounced for light aircraft with long wings, such as gliders. It is counteracted by the pilot with the rudder.  [[Differential ailerons]] are ailerons which have been rigged such that the downgoing aileron deflects less than the upward-moving one, reducing adverse yaw.\n\n====Rudder====\nThe rudder is a fundamental control surface which is typically controlled by pedals rather than at the stick. It is the primary means of controlling yaw\u2014the rotation of an airplane about its vertical axis. The rudder may also be called upon to counter-act the adverse yaw produced by the roll-control surfaces.\n\nIf rudder is continuously applied in level flight the aircraft will yaw initially in the direction of the applied rudder \u2013 the primary effect of rudder. After a few seconds the aircraft will tend to bank in the direction of yaw.\n\nThis arises initially from the increased speed of the wing opposite to the direction of yaw and the reduced speed of the other wing. The faster wing generates more lift and so rises, while the other wing tends to go down because of generating less lift. Continued application of rudder sustains rolling tendency because the aircraft flying at an angle to the airflow - skidding towards the forward wing. When applying right rudder in an aircraft with [[Dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]] the left hand wing will have increased angle of attack and the right hand wing will have decreased angle of attack which will result in a roll to the right. An aircraft with [[Dihedral (aircraft)#Anhedral|anhedral]] will show the opposite effect.\nThis effect of the rudder is commonly used in model aircraft where if sufficient diheral or polyhedral is included in the wing design, primary roll control such as ailerons may be omitted altogether.\n\n===Turning the aircraft===\n{{Main|Banked turn}}\nUnlike turning a boat, turning an aircraft is not normally done with the rudder. With aircraft, the turn is caused by the horizontal component of lift. The lifting force, perpendicular to the wings of the aircraft, is tilted in the direction of the intended turn by rolling the aircraft into the turn. As the bank angle is increased, the lifting force can be split into two components: one acting vertically and one acting horizontally.\n\nIf the total lift is kept constant, the vertical component of lift will decrease. As the weight of the aircraft is unchanged, this would result in the aircraft descending if not countered. To maintain level flight requires increased positive (up) elevator to increase the angle of attack, increase the total lift generated and keep the vertical component of lift equal with the weight of the aircraft. This cannot continue indefinitely. The total [[Load factor (aeronautics)|load factor]] required to maintain level flight is [[Banked turn#Aviation|directly related to the bank angle]]. This means that for a given airspeed, level flight can only be maintained up to a certain given angle of bank. Beyond this angle of bank, the aircraft will suffer an accelerated [[stall (flight)|stall]] if the pilot attempts to generate enough lift to maintain level flight.\n\n===Alternate main control surfaces===\n\nSome aircraft configurations have non-standard primary controls. For example, instead of elevators at the back of the stabilizers, the [[stabilator|entire tailplane may change angle]]. Some aircraft have a [[V-tail|tail in the shape of a V]], and the moving parts at the back of those combine the functions of elevators and rudder. [[Delta wing]] aircraft may have \"[[elevon]]s\" at the back of the wing, which combine the functions of elevators and ailerons.\n\n==Secondary control surfaces==\n[[File:klm.fokker70.airbrakes.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|[[KLM]] [[Fokker 70]], showing position of flap and liftdumpers '''flight controls'''. The liftdumpers are the lifted cream-coloured panels on the wing upper surface (in this picture there are five on the right wing). The flaps are the large drooped surfaces on the trailing edge of the wing.]]\n\n=== Spoilers ===\n{{Main|Spoiler (aeronautics)|Spoileron}}\nOn low drag aircraft such as [[sailplanes]], [[Spoiler (aeronautics)|spoilers]] are used to disrupt airflow over the wing and greatly reduce lift.  This allows a glider pilot to lose altitude without gaining excessive airspeed. Spoilers are sometimes called \"lift dumpers\". Spoilers that can be used asymmetrically are called [[spoileron]]s and can affect an aircraft's roll.\n\n=== Flaps ===\n{{main|Flap (aircraft)}}\n\n[[Flap (aircraft)|Flaps]] are mounted on the trailing edge on the inboard section of each wing (near the wing roots). They are deflected down to increase the effective curvature of the wing. Flaps raise the [[Lift coefficient|Maximum Lift Coefficient]] of the aircraft and therefore reduce its stalling speed.<ref>Clancy, L.J. ''Aerodynamics'' Chapter 6</ref>  They are used during low speed, high angle of attack flight including take-off and descent for landing. Some aircraft are equipped with \"[[flaperon]]s\", which are more commonly called \"inboard ailerons\"{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}.  These devices function primarily as ailerons, but on some aircraft, will \"droop\" when the flaps are deployed, thus acting as both a flap and a roll-control inboard aileron.\n\n=== Slats ===\n{{Main|Leading edge slats}}\n\n[[Leading edge slats|Slats]], also known as ''leading edge devices'', are extensions to the front of a wing for lift augmentation, and are intended to reduce the stalling speed by altering the airflow over the wing. Slats may be fixed or retractable - fixed slats (e.g. as on the [[Fieseler Fi 156|Fieseler Fi 156 Storch]]) give excellent slow speed and [[STOL]] capabilities, but compromise higher speed performance. Retractable slats, as seen on most airliners, provide reduced stalling speed for take-off and landing, but are retracted for cruising.\n\n=== Air brakes ===\n[[File:Eurowings bae146-300 d-aewb arp.jpg|thumb|right|Air brakes on the rear fuselage of a [[Eurowings]] [[British Aerospace 146|BAe 146-300]]]]\n{{Main|Air brake (aeronautics)}}\n\nAir brakes are used to increase drag. Spoilers might act as air brakes, but are not pure air brakes as they also function as lift-dumpers or in some cases as roll control surfaces. Air brakes are usually surfaces that deflect outwards from the fuselage (in most cases symmetrically on opposing sides) into the airstream in order to increase form-drag. As they are in most cases located elsewhere on the aircraft, they do not directly affect the lift generated by the wing. Their purpose is to slow down the aircraft. They are particularly useful when a high rate of descent is required or the aircraft velocity needs to be retarded. They are common on high performance military aircraft as well as civilian aircraft, especially those lacking reverse thrust capability.\n\n==Control trimming surfaces==\n{{main|Trim tab}}\n\nTrimming controls allow a pilot to balance the lift and drag being produced by the wings and control surfaces over a wide range of load and airspeed.  This reduces the effort required to adjust or maintain a desired flight [[Aircraft attitude|attitude]].\n\n===Elevator trim===\n\nElevator trim balances the control force necessary to maintain the correct aerodynamic force on the tail to balance the aircraft. Whilst carrying out certain flight exercises, a lot of trim could be required to maintain the desired angle of attack. This mainly applies to [[slow flight]], where a nose-up attitude is required, in turn requiring a lot of trim causing the tailplane to exert a strong downforce.  Elevator trim is correlated with the speed of the airflow over the tail, thus airspeed changes to the aircraft require re-trimming. An important design parameter for aircraft is the stability of the aircraft when trimmed for level flight.  Any disturbances such as gusts or turbulence will be damped over a short period of time and the aircraft will return to its level flight trimmed airspeed.\n\n====Trimming tail plane====\nExcept for very light aircraft, trim tabs on the elevators are unable to provide the force and range of motion desired. To provide the appropriate trim force the entire horizontal tail plane is made adjustable in pitch. This allows the pilot to select exactly the right amount of positive or negative lift from the tail plane while reducing drag from the elevators.\n\n====Control horn====\nA control horn is a section of control surface which projects ahead of the pivot point.  It generates a force which tends to increase the surface's deflection thus reducing the control pressure experienced by the pilot. Control horns may also incorporate a [[counterweight]] which helps to balance the control and prevent it from \"fluttering\" in the airstream. Some designs feature separate anti-flutter weights.\n\n(In radio controlled model aircraft, the term \"control horn\" has a different meaning.)<ref>\n[http://www.pc-control.co.uk/servo_control.htm \"Servo Control\"]\n</ref>\nand the other end of the rod connects to another control horn rigidly attached to the control surface.<ref>\n[http://www.modelaircraft.org/mag/FAQ/answers/faq-q28.htm Model Aircraft: control horn FAQ]\n</ref>\n\n====Spring trim====\nIn the simplest arrangement trimming is done by a mechanical [[Spring (device)|spring]] (or [[Bungee cord|bungee]]) which adds appropriate force to augment the pilot's control input. The spring is usually connected to an elevator trim lever to allow the pilot to set the spring force applied.\n\n===Rudder and aileron trim===\n\nTrim often does not only apply to the [[elevator (aircraft)|elevator]], as there is also trim for the rudder and ailerons in larger aircraft. The use of this is to counter the effects of slip stream, or to counter the effects of the [[centre of gravity]] being to one side. This can be caused by a larger weight on one side of the aircraft compared to the other, such as when one fuel tank has a lot more fuel in it than the other.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Aeronautics]]\n*[[Aileron]]\n*[[Aircraft engine controls]]\n*[[Aircraft flight control systems]]\n*[[Aircraft flight mechanics]]\n*[[Flaperon]] (flaps + aileron in one part)\n*[[Flight with disabled controls]]\n*[[Stabilator]] (stabilizer + elevator in one part)\n*[[V-tail]]\n*[[Wing warping]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*<cite>Private Pilot Manual</cite>; Jeppesen Sanderson; ISBN 0-88487-238-6 (hardcover, 1999)\n*<cite>[https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aircraft/airplane_handbook/ Airplane Flying Handbook]</cite>; U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, FAA-8083-3A.
