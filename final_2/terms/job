A job is an activity, often regular and often performed in exchange for [[money|payment]]. Many people have multiple jobs, such as those of parent, homemaker, and employee.  A person can begin a job by becoming an [[employee]], [[volunteer]]ing, starting a [[business]], or becoming a [[parent]]. The duration of a job may range from an hour (in the case of odd jobs) to a [[Lifetime employment|lifetime]] (in the case of some [[judge]]s). \n\nAn activity that requires a person's mental or physical effort is [[wage labour|work]] (as in \"a day's work\"). If a person is trained for a certain type of job, they may have a [[profession]]. The series of jobs a person holds in their life is their [[career]].\n\n== Jobs for people ==\nMost people spend up to forty, or more hours each week in paid employment.  Some exceptions are children, those who are [[retired]], and people with certain types of [[disability]], but within these groups many will work part-time or occasionally, will work in one or more [[volunteer]] positions, or will work as a [[homemaker]].  From the age of 5 or so, many children's primary role in society\u2014and therefore their 'job'\u2014is to learn and study as a [[student]].\n\n== Types of jobs ==\nJobs can be categorized by the hours per week into [[full time]] or [[part time]].  They can be categorized as [[temporary work|temporary]], [[Handyman|odd jobs]], [[seasonal jobs|seasonal]], [[self-employment]], [[consultant|consulting]], or [[contract employment.]]\n\nJobs can be categorized as paid or unpaid.  Examples of unpaid jobs include volunteer, homemaker, mentor, student, and sometimes intern.\n\nJobs can be categorized by the level of experience required: [[entry level job|entry level]], [[internship|intern]], and [[cooperative education|co-op]].\n\nSome jobs require specific [[training]] or an [[academic degree]].\n\nThose without paid full-time employment may be categorized as [[unemployed]] or [[underemployment|underemployed]] if they are seeking a full-time paid job.\n\n[[wikt:moonlight#verb|Moonlighting]] is the practice of holding an additional job or jobs, often at night, in addition to one's main job, usually to earn extra income. A person who moonlights may have little time left for sleep or leisure activities.\n\nThe [[Office for National Statistics]] in the [[United Kingdom]] lists 27,966 different job titles, within a website published 2015.<ref>Office for National Statistics - [http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/about-ons/business-transparency/freedom-of-information/previous-foi-requests/employment-and-labour-market/list-of-all-the-occupations-noted-in-the-uk/index.html FOI Request: List of all the occupations noted in the UK] published by [[The Crown]] 2015 [Retrieved 2015-12-06]</ref>\n\n=== Day job ===\n\nThe expression '''day job''' is often used for a job one works in to make ends meet while performing low-paying (or non-paying) work in their preferred [[vocation]]. Archetypal examples of this are the woman who works as a waitress (her day job) while she tries to become an [[actress]], and the [[professional athlete]] who works as a [[laborer]] in the off season because he is currently only able to make the roster of a [[semi-professional]] team.\n\nWhile many people do hold a full-time occupation, \"day job\" specifically refers to those who hold the position solely to pay living expenses so they can pursue, through low paying entry work, the job they really want (which may also be during the day).  The phrase strongly implies that the day job would be quit, if only the real vocation paid a living wage.\n\nThe phrase \"don't quit your day job\" is a humorous response to a poor or mediocre performance not up to professional caliber. The phrase implies that the performer is not talented enough in that activity to be able to make a career out of it.\n\n=== Getting a job ===\n{{further|Job hunting|Employment}}\n\nGetting a first job is an important [[rite of passage]] in many [[culture]]s.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Afsara|first1=Mahi|title=\u099a\u09be\u0995\u09b0\u09c0 \u0996\u09cb\u0981\u099c\u09be\u09b0 \u0986\u0997\u09c7 - Before Job Search|url=http://bangla.newspaper1971.com/2016/04/23/before-job-search/|website=Newspaper1971.com|publisher=Newspaper1971 Magazine, Bangladesh|accessdate=24 April 2016}}</ref> The youth may start by doing [[Housekeeping|household work]], [[Handyman|odd jobs]], or working for a [[family business]]. In many countries, school children get summer jobs during the longer [[summer vacation]]. Students enrolled in [[higher education]] can apply for [[internship]]s or [[cooperative education|coops]] to further enhance the probability of securing an [[entry level job]] upon graduation.\n\n[[Resume|R\u00e9sum\u00e9s]] summarize a person's education and job experience for potential [[employer]]s. Employers read job candidate r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to decide whom to [[job interview|interview]] for an open position.\n\n=== Use of the word ===\nWorkers often talk of \"getting a job\", or \"having a job\". This [[conceptual metaphor]] of a \"job\" as a possession has led to its use in slogans such as \"money for jobs, not bombs\". Similar conceptions are that of \"land\" as a possession ([[real estate]]) or [[intellectual rights]] as a possession ([[intellectual property]]).\n\n== Job opening ==\nIn [[economics]], a '''vacancy''' or '''job opening''' refers to a job offered by a [[business|firm]] that wishes to hire a worker. Ideally, the right person is hired at the right time in the right place to work for the organization.  The planning, or lead time, necessary to fill the job opening is worked out in advance to allow sufficient time for recruitment, offer, acceptance, notice period and start date.\n\n== Occupation and life expectancy ==\nManual work seems to shorten the lifespan.<ref>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1567252/Why-accountants-live-longer-than-builders.html</ref> High rank<ref>https://www.metlife.com/assets/cao/mmi/publications/studies/mmi-living-longer-working-longer.pdf</ref> (a higher position at ''the pecking order'') has a positive effect.
