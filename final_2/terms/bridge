There are many different designs that each serve a particular purpose and apply to different situations. Designs of bridges vary depending on the function of the bridge, the nature of the [[terrain]] where the bridge is constructed and anchored, the material used to make it, and the funds available to build it.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' traces the origin of the word ''bridge'' to an [[Old English]] word ''brycg'', of the same meaning.<ref>{{cite book|publisher=Oxford University Press|author=Fowler|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary|date=1925|page=102}}</ref> The word can be traced directly back to Proto-Indo-European ''*b\u02b0r\u0113w-.'' The word for the [[Contract bridge|card game of the same name]] has a different origin.\n\n==History==\nThe first bridges made by humans were probably spans of cut wooden logs or planks and eventually stones, using a simple support and [[crossbeam]] arrangement. Some early Americans used trees or [[bamboo]] poles to cross small caverns or wells to get from one place to another. A common form of lashing sticks, logs, and [[deciduous]] branches together involved the use of long reeds or other harvested fibers woven together to form a huge rope capable of binding and holding together the materials used in early bridges.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n[[File:Pont myc\u00e9nien de Kazarma 2.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Arkadiko Bridge]] in [[Greece]] (13th century BC), one of the oldest [[arch bridge]]s in existence]]\n\nThe [[Arkadiko Bridge]] is one of four Mycenaean [[corbel arch]] bridges part of a former network of roads, designed to accommodate [[chariot]]s, between the fort of Tiryns and town of Epidauros in the [[Peloponnese]], in southern Greece.

Common categories include the type of structural elements used, by what they carry, whether they are fixed or movable, and by the materials used.\n\n===Structure type===\n\nBridges may be classified by how the forces of [[tension (mechanics)|tension]], [[compression (physical)|compression]], [[bending]], [[torsion (mechanics)|torsion]] and [[Shear stress|shear]] are distributed through their structure. Most bridges will employ all of the principal forces to some degree, but only a few will predominate. The separation of forces may be quite clear. In a suspension or cable-stayed span, the elements in tension are distinct in shape and placement. In other cases the forces may be distributed among a large number of members, as in a truss, or not clearly discernible to a casual observer as in a box beam.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:BeamBridge-diagram.svg|200px]]'''[[Beam bridge]]'''{{br}}\n|Beam bridges are horizontal beams supported at each end by substructure units and can be either ''[[simply supported]]'' when the beams only connect across a single span, or ''continuous'' when the beams are connected across two or more spans. When there are multiple spans, the intermediate supports are known as [[bridge pier|piers]]. The earliest beam bridges were simple logs that sat across streams and similar simple structures. In modern times, beam bridges can range from small, wooden beams to large, steel boxes.  The vertical force on the bridge becomes a [[Shear stress|shear]] and [[Bending|flexural]] load on the beam which is transferred down its length to the substructures on either side<ref name=beambridge>{{cite web | url=http://www.design-technology.org/beambridges.htm | title=Beam bridges | publisher=Design Technology | accessdate=May 14, 2008}}</ref>  They are typically made of steel, concrete or wood.

This truss is a structure of connected elements forming triangular units. The connected elements (typically straight) may be stressed from tension, compression, or sometimes both in response to dynamic loads. Truss bridges are one of the oldest types of modern bridges. The basic types of truss bridges shown in this article have simple designs which could be easily analyzed by nineteenth and early twentieth century engineers. A truss bridge is economical to construct owing to its efficient use of materials.\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:CantileverBridge-diagram.svg|200px]]'''[[Cantilever bridge]]'''{{br}}\n|[[Cantilever bridge]]s are built using [[cantilever]]s\u2014horizontal beams supported on only one end. Most cantilever bridges use a pair of [[continuous span]]s that extend from opposite sides of the supporting piers to meet at the center of the obstacle the bridge crosses. Cantilever bridges are constructed using much the same materials & techniques as beam bridges. The difference comes in the action of the forces through the bridge.\n\nSome cantilever bridges also have a smaller beam connecting the two cantilevers, for extra strength.\n\nThe largest cantilever bridge is the {{convert|549|m|adj=on}} [[Quebec Bridge]] in Quebec, Canada.\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |[[File:ArchBridge-diagram.svg|200px]]'''[[Arch bridge]]'''{{br}}\n|Arch bridges have [[abutments]] at each end.

Temporary bridges, such as [[Bailey bridge]]s, are designed to be assembled, and taken apart, transported to a different site, and re-used. They are important in military engineering, and are also used to carry traffic while an old bridge is being rebuilt. [[Movable bridge]]s are designed to move out of the way of boats or other kinds of traffic, which would otherwise be too tall to fit.

The upper level carries a railway, and the lower level is used for road traffic. Other examples include [[Britannia Bridge]] over the [[Menai Strait]] and [[Craigavon Bridge]] in [[Derry]], [[Northern Ireland]]. The [[Oresund Bridge]] between [[Copenhagen]] and [[Malm\u00f6]] consists of a four-lane highway on the upper level and a pair of railway tracks at the lower level.

Often, this is the case with a large bridge that serves as an entrance to a city, or crosses over a main harbor entrance. These are sometimes known as ''signature bridges''. Designers of bridges in parks and along parkways often place more importance to aesthetics, as well. Examples include the stone-faced bridges along the [[Taconic State Parkway]] in New York.\n\nTo create a beautiful image, some bridges are built much taller than necessary. This type, often found in east-Asian style gardens, is called a [[Moon bridge]], evoking a rising full moon. Other garden bridges may cross only a dry bed of stream washed pebbles, intended only to convey an impression of a stream. Often in palaces a bridge will be built over an artificial waterway as symbolic of a passage to an important place or state of mind. A set of five bridges cross a sinuous waterway in an important courtyard of the [[Forbidden City]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]]. The central bridge was reserved exclusively for the use of the Emperor, Empress, and their attendants.\n\n==Bridge maintenance==\nBridge maintenance consisting of a combination of structural health monitoring and testing. This is regulated in country-specific engineer standards and includes e.g. an ongoing monitoring every three to six months, a simple test or inspection every two to three years and a major inspection every six to ten years. In Europe, the cost of maintenance is higher than spending on new bridges. The lifetime of welded steel bridges can be significantly extended by [[High Frequency Impact Treatment|aftertreatment of the weld transitions]] . This results in a potential high benefit, using existing bridges far beyond the planned lifetime.\n[[File:Example HiFIT-treated assembly.jpg|thumb|Highway bridge with steel hollow box sections, performed for lifetime extension by welding aftertreatment]]\n\n==Bridge failures==\n<!-- [[bridge failure]] and [[bridge failures]] redirect here; be sure to update them if changing the section title -->\n{{see also|List of bridge failures}}\n\nThe failure of bridges is of special concern for [[structural engineers]] in trying to learn lessons vital to bridge design, construction and maintenance. The failure of bridges first assumed national interest during the [[Victorian era]] when many new designs were being built, often using new materials.\n\nIn the United States, the [[National Bridge Inventory]] tracks the structural evaluations of all bridges, including designations such as \"structurally deficient\" and \"functionally obsolete\".\n\n==Bridge monitoring==\nThere are several methods used to monitor the stress on large structures like bridges. The most common method is the use of an [[accelerometer]], which is integrated into the bridge while it is being built. This technology is used for long-term surveillance of the bridge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mnme.com/pdf/smartbridge.pdf|title=The new Minnesota smart bridge|work=mnme.com |accessdate=January 30, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAnother option for structural-integrity monitoring is \"non-contact monitoring\", which uses the [[Doppler effect]] (Doppler shift). A [[laser]] beam from a [[Laser Doppler Vibrometer]] is directed at the point of interest, and the vibration amplitude and frequency are extracted from the Doppler shift of the laser beam frequency due to the motion of the surface.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polytec.com/us/solutions/vibration-measurement/basic-principles-of-vibrometry/|title=Basic Principles of Vibrometry|work=polytec.com |accessdate=January 25, 2012}}</ref> The advantage of this method is that the setup time for the equipment is faster and, unlike an accelerometer, this makes measurements possible on multiple structures in as short a time as possible.  Additionally, this method can measure specific points on a bridge that might be difficult to access.\n\n==Visual index==\n{{Further information|List of bridge types|List of longest bridges in the world}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Bridges}}\n{{div col|2}}\n* [[Architectural engineering]]\n* [[Bridge chapel]]\n* [[Bridge tower]]\n* [[Bridge to nowhere]]\n* [[Bridges Act]]\n* [[BS 5400]], a British Standard for steel, concrete and composite bridges\n* [[BT Centre for Major Programme Management]]\n* [[Causeway]]\n* [[Coal trestle]]\n* [[Cost overrun]] in bridge construction\n* [[Cross-sea traffic ways]]\n* [[Culvert]]\n* [[Deck (bridge)|Deck]]\n* [[Footbridge]]\n* [[Landscape architecture]]\n* [[Megaproject]]\n* [[Military bridge]]s\n* [[Overpass]]\n* [[Pontoon bridge]]\n* [[Rigid-frame bridge]]\n* [[Transporter bridge]]\n* [[Tensegrity]]\n* [[Trestle bridge]]\n* [[Tunnel]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Brown, David J.
