This was followed by the Rohini series of experimental satellites which were built and launched indigenously. At present, ISRO operates a large number of earth observation satellites.\n\n===The INSAT series===\n{{Main article|Indian National Satellite System}}\nINSAT (Indian National Satellite System) is a series of multipurpose geostationary satellites launched by ISRO to satisfy the telecommunications, broadcasting, meteorology and search-and-rescue needs of India. Commissioned in 1983, INSAT is the largest domestic communication system in the Asia-Pacific Region. It is a joint venture of the Department of Space, Department of Telecommunications, [[India Meteorological Department]], [[All India Radio]] and [[Doordarshan]]. The overall coordination and management of INSAT system rests with the Secretary-level INSAT Coordination Committee.\n\n===The IRS series===\n{{Main article|Indian Remote Sensing satellite}}\nIndian Remote Sensing satellites (IRS) are a series of earth observation satellites, built, launched and maintained by ISRO. The IRS series provides remote sensing services to the country. The Indian Remote Sensing Satellite system is the largest constellation of remote sensing satellites for civilian use in operation today in the world. All the satellites are placed in polar [[Sun-synchronous orbit]] and provide data in a variety of spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions to enable several programmes to be undertaken relevant to national development. The initial versions are composed of the 1 ([[IRS-1A|A]], [[IRS-1B|B]], [[IRS-1C|C]], [[IRS-1D|D]]) nomenclature. The later versions are named based on their area of application including OceanSat, CartoSat, ResourceSat.\n\n===Radar Imaging Satellites===\nISRO currently operates two [[RISAT|Radar Imaging Satellites]]. [[RISAT-1]] was launched from Sriharikota Spaceport on 26 April 2012 on board a PSLV.

The Indian SBAS system has been given an acronym GAGAN \u2013 GPS Aided GEO Augmented Navigation. A national plan for satellite navigation including implementation of Technology Demonstration System (TDS) over the Indian air space as a proof of concept has been prepared jointly by Airports Authority of India (AAI) and ISRO. TDS was successfully completed during 2007 by installing eight Indian Reference Stations (INRESs) at eight Indian airports and linked to the Master Control Centre (MCC) located near [[Bangalore]].\n\nThe first GAGAN navigation payload has been fabricated and it was proposed to be flown on GSAT-4 during Apr 2010. However, GSAT-4 was not placed in orbit as GSLV-D3 could not complete the mission. Two more GAGAN payloads will be subsequently flown, one each on two geostationary satellites, GSAT-8 and GSAT-10.

With these considerations, an [[X-ray astronomy]] group was formed at TIFR in 1967 and development of an instrument with an orientable [[X-ray telescope]] for hard X-ray observations was undertaken. The first balloon flight with the new instrument was made on 28 April 1968 in which observations of Scorpius X-1 were successfully carried out. In a succession of balloon flights made with this instrument between 1968 and 1974 a number of binary X-ray sources including Scorpius X-1, [[Cygnus X-1|Cyg X-1]], [[Her X-1]] etc. and the [[Diffuse X-ray background|diffuse cosmic X-ray background]] were studied. Many new and astrophysically important results were obtained from these observations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isro.org/space_science/images/BalloonXrayStudies.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=17 March 2009 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020528045243/http://www.isro.org/space_science/images/BalloonXrayStudies.htm |archivedate=28 May 2002 }}</ref>\n\nOne of most important achievements of ISRO in this field was the discovery of three species of bacteria in the upper stratosphere at an altitude of between 20\u201340&nbsp;km. The bacteria, highly resistant to [[ultra-violet radiation]], are not found elsewhere on Earth, leading to speculation on whether they are extraterrestrial in origin. These three bacteria can be considered to be [[extremophile]]s. Until then, the upper stratosphere was believed to be inhospitable because of the high doses of ultra-violet radiation. The bacteria were named as Bacillus isronensis in recognition of ISRO's contribution in the balloon experiments, which led to its discovery, Bacillus aryabhata after India's celebrated ancient astronomer [[Aryabhata]] and Janibacter Hoylei after the distinguished astrophysicist [[Fred Hoyle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sify.com/news/fullstory.php?id=14871264&?vsv=TopHP1|title=Page Not Found|publisher=|accessdate=24 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Astrosat===\nThe Astrosat is india first multiwave length [[space observatory]] and full fledged astronomy satellite.Its observation study includes [[active galactic nuclei]],hot [[white dwarfs]],pulsations of [[pulsars]], [[binary star systems]], [[super massive black holes]] located at the center of the [[galaxies]].etc.\n\n==Extraterrestrial exploration==\n\n===First mission to the Moon: Chandrayaan-1===\n[[File:Chandrayaan-1.jpg|thumb|Model of the [[Chandrayaan-1]] spacecraft]]\n[[Chandrayaan-1]] was India's first mission to the moon.

The vehicle was successfully inserted into lunar orbit on 8 November 2008. It carried high-resolution remote sensing equipment for visible, near infrared, and soft and hard X-ray frequencies. During its 312 days operational period (2 years planned), it surveyed the lunar surface to produce a complete map of its chemical characteristics and 3-dimensional topography. The polar regions were of special interest, as they possibly had [[lunar ice|ice]] deposits. The spacecraft carried a total of 11 instruments: 5 Indian and 6 from foreign institutes and space agencies (including [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]], [[European Space Agency|ESA]], [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]], [[Brown University]] and other European and North American institutes/companies) which were carried free of cost.

Launch of the Aditya mission was planned during the heightened solar activity period in 2012, but was postponed to 2019\u20132020 due to the extensive work involved in the fabrication, and other technical aspects. The main objective of the mission is to study Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), their properties (the structure and evolution of their magnetic fields for example), and consequently delineate parameters that affect space weather.\n\n===Space science missions===\n'''[[Space Capsule Recovery Experiment II]]''': The main objective of SRE II is to release a fully recoverable capsule and provide a platform to conduct microgravity experiments on Micro-biology, Agriculture, Powder Metallurgy, etc. SRE-2 is proposed to be launched on board PSLV. On 18 December 2014, ISRO successfully tested an unmanned crew module with re-entry which was splashed down later in the Bay of Bengal as planned.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Telecommunication===\nIndia uses its satellites communication network \u2013 one of the largest in the world \u2013 for applications such as land management, water resources management, natural disaster forecasting, radio networking, weather forecasting, meteorological imaging and computer communication.<ref name=Bhaskaranarayana1738>Bhaskaranarayana, 1738\u20131746</ref> Business, administrative services, and schemes such as the [[National Informatics Centre]] (NICNET) are direct beneficiaries of applied satellite technology.<ref name=autogenerated1>Bhaskaranarayana, 1738</ref> Dinshaw Mistry, on the subject of practical applications of the Indian space programme, writes:\n:\"The INSAT-2 satellites also provide telephone links to remote areas; data transmission for organisations such as the [[National Stock Exchange of India|National Stock Exchange]]; mobile satellite service communications for private operators, railways, and road transport; and broadcast satellite services, used by India's state-owned television agency as well as commercial television channels. India's [[GSAT-3|EDUSAT]] (Educational Satellite), launched aboard the GSLV in 2004, was intended for adult literacy and distance learning applications in rural areas. It augmented and would eventually replace such capabilities already provided by INSAT-3B.\"\n\n===Resource management===\nThe IRS satellites have found applications with the Indian Natural Resource Management programme, with regional Remote Sensing Service Centres in five Indian cities, and with Remote Sensing Application Centres in twenty Indian states that use IRS images for economic development applications. These include environmental monitoring, analysing soil erosion and the impact of soil conservation measures, forestry management, determining land cover for wildlife sanctuaries, delineating groundwater potential zones, flood inundation mapping, drought monitoring, estimating crop acreage and deriving agricultural production estimates, fisheries monitoring, mining and geological applications such as surveying metal and mineral deposits, and urban planning.\n\n===Military===\nIndia's satellites and satellite launch vehicles have had military spin-offs. While India's 93\u2013124-mile (150\u2013250&nbsp;km) range [[Prithvi missile]] is not derived from the Indian space programme, the intermediate range [[Agni missile]] is drawn from the Indian space programme's SLV-3. In its early years, when headed by Vikram Sarabhai and Satish Dhawan, ISRO opposed military applications for its dual-use projects such as the SLV-3. Eventually, however, the [[Defence Research and Development Organisation]] (DRDO) based missile programme borrowed human resources and technology from ISRO. Missile scientist [[A.P.J. Abdul Kalam]] (elected president of India in 2002), who had headed the SLV-3 project at ISRO, moved to [[Defence Research and Development Organisation|DRDO]] to direct India's missile programme. About a dozen scientists accompanied Kalam from ISRO to [[Defence Research and Development Organisation|DRDO]], where he designed the Agni missile using the SLV-3's solid fuel first stage and a liquid-fuel (Prithvi-missile-derived) second stage. The IRS and INSAT satellites were primarily intended and used for civilian-economic applications, but they also offered military spin-offs. In 1996 New Delhi's Ministry of Defence temporarily blocked the use of [[IRS-1C]] by India's environmental and agricultural ministries in order to monitor ballistic missiles near India's borders. In 1997 the [[Indian Air Force]]'s \"Airpower Doctrine\" aspired to use space assets for surveillance and battle management.<ref name=mistry94>Mistry, 94\u201395</ref>\n\n===Academic===\nInstitutions like the [[Indira Gandhi National Open University]] (IGNOU) and the [[Indian Institutes of Technology]] use satellites for scholarly applications.<ref name=Bhaskaranarayana1744>Bhaskaranarayana, 1744</ref> Between 1975 and 1976, India conducted its largest sociological programme using space technology, reaching 2400 villages through video programming in local languages aimed at educational development via [[ATS-6]] technology developed by NASA.<ref name=Bhaskaranarayana1737>Bhaskaranarayana, 1737</ref> This experiment\u2014named [[Satellite Instructional Television Experiment]] (SITE)\u2014conducted large scale video broadcasts resulting in significant improvement in rural education.<ref name=Bhaskaranarayana1737/> Education could reach far remote rural places with the help of above programmes.\n\n===Telemedicine===\nISRO has applied its technology to \"telemedicine\", directly connecting patients in rural areas to medical professionals in urban locations via satellites.<ref name=Bhaskaranarayana1744/> Since high-quality healthcare is not universally available in some of the remote areas of India, the patients in remote areas are diagnosed and analysed by doctors in urban centres in real time via [[video conferencing]].<ref name=Bhaskaranarayana1744/> The patient is then advised medicine and treatment.<ref name=Bhaskaranarayana1744/> The patient is then treated by the staff at one of the 'super-specialty hospitals' under instructions from the doctor.<ref name=Bhaskaranarayana1744/> Mobile telemedicine vans are also deployed to visit locations in far-flung areas and provide diagnosis and support to patients.<ref name=Bhaskaranarayana1744/>\n\n===Biodiversity Information System===\nISRO has also helped implement India's Biodiversity Information System, completed in October 2002.<ref name=sen490/> Nirupa Sen details the programme: \"Based on intensive field sampling and mapping using satellite remote sensing and geospatial modelling tools, maps have been made of vegetation cover on a 1 : 250,000 scale.

As an example of its value, in 2010, 20 [[Megahertz|MHz]] of [[3G]] spectrum was [[Indian Telecom Spectrum Auction|auctioned]] for {{INRConvert|67700|c}}. This part of the spectrum is allocated for terrestrial communication (cell phones). However, in January 2005, [[Antrix Corporation]] (commercial arm of ISRO) signed an agreement with Devas Multimedia (a private company formed by former ISRO employees and venture capitalists from USA) for lease of [[S band]] transponders (amounting to 70&nbsp;MHz of spectrum) on two ISRO satellites (GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A) for a price of {{INRConvert|1400|c}}, to be paid over a period of 12 years. The spectrum used in these satellites (2500&nbsp;MHz and above) is allocated by the [[International Telecommunication Union]] specifically for satellite-based communication in India. Hypothetically, if the spectrum allocation is changed for utilization for terrestrial transmission and if this 70&nbsp;MHz of spectrum were sold at the 2010 auction price of the 3G spectrum, its value would have been over {{INRConvert|200000|c}}. This was a hypothetical situation. However, the [[Comptroller and Auditor General of India]] considered this hypothetical situation and estimated the difference between the prices as a loss to the Indian Government.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2096834/Space-age-scam-The-murky-plot-Antrix-Devas-S-band-deal-revealed.html | title=Space-age scam: the media tracked this Antrix-Devas deal was equated to the Telecommunication Scam, which was taking place in India around the same time | work=Daily Mail | date=6 February 2012 | accessdate=6 February 2015 | author=Sharma, Dinesh}}</ref><ref name=\"Thakur, Pradeep\">{{cite news | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Another-spectrum-scam-hits-govt-this-time-from-ISRO/articleshow/7445139.cms | title=Another spectrum scam hits govt, this time from ISRO | work=The Times of India | date=8 February 2011 | accessdate=6 February 2015 | author=Thakur, Pradeep | location=New Delhi}}</ref><ref name=\"Behind the S-band spectrum scandal\">{{cite news | url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/behind-the-sband-spectrum-scandal/article1200374.ece | title=Behind the S-band spectrum scandal | work=The Hindu | date=28 September 2011 | accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThere were lapses on implementing Government of India procedures. Antrix/ISRO had allocated capacity of the above two satellites to Devas Multimedia on an exclusive basis, while rules said it should always be non-exclusive. The [[Cabinet of India|Cabinet]] was misinformed in November 2005 that several service providers were interested in using satellite capacity, while the Devas deal was already signed. Also, the Space Commission was kept in the dark while taking approval for the second satellite (its cost was diluted so that Cabinet approval was not needed). ISRO committed to spending {{INRConvert|766|c}} of public money on building, launching, and operating two satellites which were leased out for Devas.<ref name=\"Sharma, Dinesh\">{{cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2096834/Space-age-scam-The-murky-plot-Antrix-Devas-S-band-deal-revealed.html | title=Space-age scam: the murky plot behind Antrix-Devas deal revealed | work=Daily Mail | date=6 February 2012 | accessdate=6 February 2015 | author=Sharma, Dinesh}}</ref>\n\nIn late 2009, some ISRO insiders exposed information about the Devas-Antrix deal,<ref name=\"Behind the S-band spectrum scandal\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsroom24x7.com/2015/03/20/2862/antrix-devas-news-lalit-shastri/#main|title=antrix-devas-news-lalit-shastri|work=Newsroom24x7|accessdate=24 May 2016}}</ref> and the ensuing investigations resulted in the deal being annulled.
