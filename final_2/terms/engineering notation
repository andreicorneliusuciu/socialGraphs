For example, 500&nbsp;\u00b5m and 500&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>\u22126</sup>&nbsp;m cannot express the [[uncertainty]] distinctions between 5&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>\u22124</sup>&nbsp;m, 5.0&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>\u22124</sup>&nbsp;m, and 5.00&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>\u22124</sup>&nbsp;m. This can be solved by changing the range of the coefficient in front of the power from the common 1\u20131000 to 0.001\u20131.0. In some cases this may be suitable; in others it may be impractical. In the previous example, 0.5&nbsp;mm, 0.50&nbsp;mm, or 0.500&nbsp;mm would have been used to show uncertainty and significant figures. It is also common to state the precision explicitly, such as \"47&nbsp;k&Omega; \u00b15%\"\n\nAnother example: when the [[speed of light]] (exactly {{val|299792458|u=m/s}} by the definition of the meter and second) is expressed as 3.00&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;m/s or 3.00&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;km/s then it is clear that it is between 299 500&nbsp;km/s and 300 500&nbsp;km/s, but when using 300&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;m/s, or 300&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;km/s, 300 000&nbsp;km/s, or the unusual but short 300&nbsp;Mm/s, this is not clear. A possibility is using 0.300&nbsp;Gm/s, convenient to write, but somewhat impractical in understanding (writing something large as a fraction of something even larger; in a context of larger numbers expressed in the same unit this could be convenient, but that is not applicable here).\n\nEngineering notation, like scientific notation generally, can use the [[E notation]], such that\n\n:3.0 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22129</sup>\n\ncan be written as\n\n:3.0E\u22129 or 3.0e\u22129\n\nThe ''E'' or ''e'' should not be confused with the [[E (mathematical constant)|exponential ''e'']] which holds a completely different significance. In the latter case, it would be shown that 3e<sup>\u22129</sup> \u2248 0.000 370 23.\n\n{{SI prefixes}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Significant figures]]\n* [[Scientific notation]]\n* [[Binary prefix]]\n* [[International System of Units]] (SI)\n\n== Notes ==\n\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://reference.techdefragmented.com/engineering/engineering_notation.html Engineering notations reference]\n*[http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Number%3A%3AFormatEng Perl CPAN module for converting number to engineering notation]\n*[http://www.labbookpages.co.uk/software/java/engNotation.html Java functions for converting between a string and a double type]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Engineering Notation}}\n[[Category:Engineering|Notation, Engineering]]\n[[Category:Numeral systems]]\n[[Category:Notation]]"}]}}}}
