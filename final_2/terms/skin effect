For [[alternating current]], most (63%) of the electric current flows between the surface and the skin depth, \u03b4, which depends on the frequency of the current and the electrical and magnetic properties of the conductor.]]\n[[File:Bundle conductors.jpg|thumb|The 3-wire bundles in this power transmission installation act as a single conductor. A single wire using the same amount of metal per kilometer would have higher losses due to the skin effect.]]\n\n'''Skin effect''' is the tendency of an [[alternating current|alternating electric current]] (AC) to become distributed within a [[Conductor (material)|conductor]] such that the [[current density]] is largest near the surface of the conductor, and decreases with greater depths in the conductor. The electric current flows mainly at the \"skin\" of the conductor, between the outer surface and a level called the '''skin depth'''. The skin effect causes the effective [[electrical resistance|resistance]] of the conductor to increase at higher [[Frequency|frequencies]] where the skin depth is smaller, thus reducing the effective cross-section of the conductor. The skin effect is due to opposing [[eddy current]]s induced by the changing [[magnetic]] field resulting from the alternating current. At 60 [[Hertz|Hz]] in copper, the skin depth is about 8.5&nbsp;mm. At high frequencies the skin depth becomes much smaller. Increased AC resistance due to the skin effect can be mitigated by using specially woven [[litz wire]]. Because the interior of a large conductor carries so little of the current, tubular conductors such as pipe can be used to save weight and cost.\n\n== Cause ==\n[[File:Skineffect reason.svg|thumb|right|Skin depth is due to the circulating [[eddy current]]s (arising from a changing H field) cancelling the current flow in the center of a conductor and reinforcing it in the skin.]]\n\nConductors, typically in the form of wires, may be used to transmit electrical energy or signals using an [[alternating current]] flowing through that conductor. The charge carriers constituting that current, usually [[electron]]s, are driven by an electric field due to the source of electrical energy. An alternating current in a conductor produces an alternating magnetic field in and around the conductor.  When the intensity of current in a conductor changes, the magnetic field also changes.  The change in the magnetic field, in turn, creates an electric field which opposes the change in current intensity.  This opposing electric field is called \u201c[[counter-electromotive force]]\u201d (back EMF).  The back EMF is strongest at the center of the conductor, and forces the conducting electrons to the outside of the conductor, as shown in the diagram on the right.<ref name=\"Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers (14th ed)) p. 2-50\">\"These emf's are greater at the center than at the circumference, so the potential difference tends to establish currents that oppose the current at the center and assist it at the circumference\" {{cite book| last=Fink |first= Donald G. | last2= Beaty | first2= H. Wayne|year= 2000 |title=Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers |edition=14th |publisher= McGraw-Hill |isbn= 0-07-022005-0 | p=2\u201350}}</ref>\n\nAn alternating current may also be ''induced'' in a conductor due to an alternating magnetic field according to the law of [[Electromagnetic induction|induction]]. An [[electromagnetic wave]] impinging on a conductor will therefore generally produce such a current; this explains the reflection of electromagnetic waves from metals.\n\nRegardless of the driving force, the [[current density]] is found to be greatest at the conductor's surface, with a reduced magnitude deeper in the conductor. That decline in current density is known as the ''skin effect'' and the ''skin depth'' is a measure of the depth at which the current density falls to [[E (mathematical constant)|1/e]] of its value near the surface.\nOver 98% of the current will flow within a layer 4 times the skin depth from the surface. This behavior is distinct from that of [[direct current]] which usually will be distributed evenly over the cross-section of the wire.\n\nThe effect was first described in a paper by [[Horace Lamb]] in 1883 for the case of spherical conductors, and was generalised to conductors of any shape by [[Oliver Heaviside]] in 1885. The skin effect has practical consequences in the analysis and design of  [[radio]]-frequency and [[microwave]] circuits, transmission lines (or waveguides), and antennas. It is also important  at mains frequencies (50\u201360&nbsp;Hz) in AC [[electric power transmission|electrical power transmission and distribution]] systems. Although the term \"skin effect\" is most often associated with applications involving transmission of electric currents, the skin depth also describes the exponential decay of the electric and magnetic fields, as well as the density of induced currents, inside a bulk material when a plane wave impinges on it at normal incidence.\n\n== Formula ==\n\nThe AC [[current density]] ''J'' in a conductor [[exponential decay|decreases exponentially]] from its value at the surface ''J''<sub>S</sub>\naccording to the depth ''d'' from the surface, as follows:<ref name=\"Hayt_5\">{{Citation |last=Hayt |first= William H. |year= 1989 |title= Engineering Electromagnetics |edition= 5th |publisher= McGraw-Hill |isbn= 0070274061 }}</ref>{{rp|362}}\n\n: <math>J=J_\\mathrm{S} \\,e^{-{(1+j)d/\\delta }}</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03b4'' is called the ''skin depth''.  The skin depth is thus defined as the depth below the surface of the conductor at which the current density has fallen to 1/[[e (mathematical constant)|e]] (about 0.37) of ''J''<sub>S</sub>.  The imaginary part of the exponent indicates that the phase of the current density is [[phase delay|delayed]] 1 radian for each skin depth of penetration.  One full [[wavelength]] in the conductor requires 2\u03c0 skin depths, at which point the current density is attenuated to e<sup>\u22122\u03c0</sup> (-54.6&nbsp;dB) of its surface value. The wavelength in the conductor is much shorter than the wavelength in [[vacuum]], or equivalently, the [[wave#Phase velocity and group velocity|phase velocity]] in the conductor is very much slower than the [[speed of light]] in vacuum.  For example, a 1&nbsp;MHz radio wave has a wavelength in vacuum \u03bb<sub>0</sub> of about 300m, whereas  in copper, the wavelength is reduced to only about 0.5&nbsp;mm with a phase velocity of only about 500&nbsp;m/s.  As a consequence of [[Snell's law]] and this very tiny phase velocity in the conductor, any wave entering the conductor, even at grazing incidence, refracts essentially in the direction perpendicular to the conductor's surface.\n\nThe general formula for the skin depth is:<ref name=\"VanderVorst41\">{{Harvtxt|Vander Vorst|Rosen|Kotsuka|2006|pg=41}}</ref><ref name=\"Jordan\">The formula as shown is algebraically equivalent to the formula found on page 130 {{Harvtxt|Jordan|1968|p=130}}</ref>\n\n: <math>\\delta= \\sqrt{{2\\rho }\\over{\\omega\\mu}}\n\\; \\;  \\sqrt{ \\sqrt{1 + \\left({\\rho\\omega\\epsilon}\\right)^2 }\n+ \\rho\\omega\\epsilon}  </math>\n\nwhere\n: <math> \\rho </math>  = [[resistivity]] of the conductor\n: <math> \\omega </math> = [[angular frequency]] of current = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 frequency\n: <math> \\mu_r </math> = relative [[magnetic permeability]] of the conductor\n: <math> \\mu_0 </math> = the [[permeability of free space]]\n: <math> \\mu </math> = <math> \\mu_r </math><math> \\mu_0 </math>\n: <math> \\epsilon_r </math> = relative [[permittivity]] of the material\n: <math> \\epsilon_0 </math> = the [[permittivity of free space]]\n: <math> \\epsilon </math> = <math> \\epsilon_r </math><math> \\epsilon_0 </math>\n\nAt frequencies much below <math>1/\\rho \\epsilon</math> the quantity inside the large radical is close to unity and the formula is more usually given as:\n\n: <math>\\delta=\\sqrt{{2\\rho }\\over{\\omega\\mu}}</math>.\n\nThis formula is valid away from strong atomic or molecular resonances (where <math>\\epsilon</math> would have a large imaginary part) and at frequencies which are much below both the material's [[plasma frequency]] (dependent on the density of free electrons in the material) and the reciprocal of the mean time between collisions involving the conduction electrons. In good conductors such as metals all of those conditions are ensured at least up to microwave frequencies, justifying this formula's validity.<ref group=note>Note that the above equation for the current density inside the conductor as a function of depth applies to cases where the usual approximation for the skin depth holds. In the extreme cases where it doesn't, the exponential decrease with respect to the skin depth still applies to the ''magnitude'' of the induced currents, however the imaginary part of the exponent in that equation, and thus the phase velocity inside the material, are altered with respect to that equation.</ref> For example, in the case of copper, this would be true for frequencies much below 10<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Hz.\n\nHowever, in very poor conductors, at sufficiently high frequencies,\nthe factor under the large radical increases. At frequencies much higher than  <math>1/\\rho \\epsilon</math> it can be shown that the skin depth, rather than continuing to decrease, approaches an asymptotic value:\n\n: <math>\\delta \\approx  {2 \\rho} \\sqrt{\\epsilon \\over \\mu} </math>\n\nThis departure from the usual formula only applies for materials of rather low conductivity and at frequencies where the vacuum wavelength is not much larger than the skin depth itself. For instance, bulk silicon (undoped) is a poor conductor and has a skin depth of about 40&nbsp;meters at 100&nbsp;kHz (&lambda; = 3000&nbsp;m). However, as the frequency is increased well into the megahertz range, its skin depth never falls below the asymptotic value of 11 meters. The conclusion is that in poor solid conductors such as undoped silicon, the skin effect doesn't need to be taken into account in most practical situations: any current is equally distributed throughout the material's cross-section regardless of its frequency.\n\n==Formula for round conductor==\n\nWhen the skin depth is not small with respect to the radius of the wire, [[current density]] may be described in terms of [[Bessel function]]s.  The current density inside round wire away from the influences of other fields, as function of distance from the axis is given by Weeks.<ref name=\"Walter_Weeks\">{{Citation |last=Weeks |first= Walter L. |year= 1981 |title= Transmission and Distribution of Electrical Energy |publisher= Harper & Row |isbn= 006046982X |doi=}}</ref>{{rp|38}}\n\n[[File:Current Density in Round Wire for Variuos Skin Depths.png|thumb|300px|Current density in round wire for various skin depths.

The inductance accounts for energy stored in the magnetic field ''inside'' the wire.  It has a maximum value of <math> \\frac { \\mu } { 8 \\pi  }  </math> H/m at zero frequency and goes to zero as the frequency increases.

The effective cross-sectional area is approximately equal to ''\u03b4'' times the conductor's circumference.\nThus a long cylindrical conductor such as a wire, having a diameter ''D'' large compared to ''\u03b4'', has a resistance ''approximately'' that of a hollow tube with wall thickness ''\u03b4'' carrying direct current.  The AC resistance of a wire of length ''L'' and resistivity <math>\\rho</math> is:\n\n: <math>R\\approx\n{{L \\rho} \\over {\\pi (D-\\delta) \\delta}}\n\\approx\n{{L \\rho} \\over {\\pi D \\delta}}\n </math>\n\nThe final approximation above assumes <math>D \\gg \\delta</math>.\n\nA convenient formula (attributed to [[Frederick Terman|F.E. Terman]]) for the diameter ''D''<sub>W</sub> of a wire of circular cross-section whose resistance will increase by 10% at frequency ''f'' is:<ref>{{harvnb|Terman|1943|p=??}}</ref>\n\n: <math>D_\\mathrm{W} = {\\frac{200~\\mathrm{mm}}{\\sqrt{f/\\mathrm{Hz}}}}</math>\n\nThe increase in AC resistance described above is accurate only for an isolated wire.  For a wire close to other wires, e.g. in a [[cable]] or a coil, the ac resistance is also affected by [[proximity effect (electromagnetism)|proximity effect]], which often causes a much more severe increase in ac resistance.\n\n== Material effect on skin depth ==\n\nIn a good conductor, skin depth is proportional to square root of the resistivity.  This means that better conductors have a reduced skin depth.  The overall resistance of the better conductor remains lower even with the reduced skin depth. However the better conductor will show a higher ratio between its AC and DC resistance, when compared with a conductor of higher resistivity. For example, at 60&nbsp;Hz, a [[American wire gauge|2000 MCM]] (1000 square millimetre) copper conductor has 23% more resistance than it does at DC.  The same size conductor in aluminum has only 10% more resistance with 60&nbsp;Hz AC than it does with DC.<ref>{{citation |editor-first=Donald G. |editor-last=Fink |editor-first2=H. Wayne |editor-last2=Beatty |title=Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers |edition=11th |publisher=McGraw Hill |year=1978 |page=Table 18\u201321 |isbn= }}</ref>\n\nSkin depth also varies as the inverse square root of the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] of the conductor.  In the case of iron, its conductivity is about 1/7 that of copper.  However being [[ferromagnetic]] its permeability is about 10,000 times greater.  This reduces the skin depth for iron to about 1/38 that of copper, about 220 [[micrometre]]s at 60&nbsp;Hz.  Iron wire is thus useless for A.C. power lines (except to add mechanical strength by serving as a core to a non ferromagnetic conductor like aluminum). The skin effect also reduces the effective thickness of [[lamination]]s in power transformers, increasing their losses.\n\nIron rods work well for [[Direct current|direct-current]] (DC) [[welding]] but it is impossible to use them at frequencies much higher than 60&nbsp;Hz.  At a few kilohertz, the welding rod will glow red hot as current flows through the greatly increased A.C. resistance resulting from the skin effect, with relatively little power remaining for the  [[Arc welding|arc]] itself.  Only [[non-magnetic]] rods can be used for high-frequency welding.\n\nAt 1 megahertz the skin effect depth in wet soil is about 5.03&nbsp;m, in seawater it's about 0.25&nbsp;m.<ref>{{harvnb|Popovic|Popovic|1999|p=385}}</ref>\n\n== Mitigation ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Transformer]] -->\n\nA type of cable called [[litz wire]] (from the [[German language|German]] ''Litzendraht'', braided wire) is used to mitigate the skin effect for frequencies of a few kilohertz to about one megahertz.  It consists of a number of insulated wire strands woven together in a carefully designed pattern, so that the overall magnetic field acts equally on all the wires and causes the total current to be distributed equally among them. With the skin effect having little effect on each of the thin strands, the bundle does not suffer the same increase in AC resistance that a solid conductor of the same cross-sectional area would due to the skin effect.<ref>{{harvnb|Xi Nan|Sullivan|2005}}</ref>\n\nLitz wire is often used in the windings of high-frequency [[transformer]]s to increase their efficiency by mitigating both skin effect and [[proximity effect (electromagnetism)|proximity effect]].\nLarge power transformers are wound with stranded conductors of similar construction to litz wire, but employing a larger cross-section corresponding to the larger skin depth at mains frequencies.<ref name=\"cegb_1982\">{{cite book\n| author = Central Electricity Generating Board\n| title = Modern Power Station Practice\n| year = 1982\n|publisher = Pergamon Press}}</ref>\nConductive threads composed of [[carbon nanotube]]s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090309121941.htm |title=Spinning Carbon Nanotubes Spawns New Wireless Applications |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=2009-03-09 |accessdate=2011-11-08}}</ref> have been demonstrated as conductors for antennas from medium wave to microwave frequencies. Unlike standard antenna conductors, the nanotubes are much smaller than the skin depth, allowing full utilization of the thread's cross-section resulting in an extremely light antenna.\n\nHigh-voltage, high-current [[overhead power line]]s often use [[Aluminium Conductor Steel Reinforced|aluminum cable with a steel reinforcing core]]; the higher resistance of the steel core is of no consequence since it is located far below the skin depth where essentially no AC current flows.\n\nIn applications where high currents (up to thousands of amperes) flow, solid conductors are usually replaced by tubes, completely eliminating the inner portion of the conductor where little current flows. This hardly affects the AC resistance, but considerably reduces the weight of the conductor. The high strength but low weight of tubes substantially increases span capability. Tubular conductors are typical in electric power switchyards where the distance between supporting insulators may be several meters. Long spans generally exhibit physical sag but this does not affect electrical performance. To avoid losses, the conductivity of the tube material must be high.\n\nIn high current situations where conductors (round or flat busbar) may be between 5 and 50&nbsp;mm thick the skin effect also occurs at sharp bends where the metal is compressed inside the bend and stretched outside the bend. The shorter path at the inner surface results in a lower resistance, which causes most of the current to be concentrated close to the inner bend surface. This will cause an increase in temperature rise in that region compared with the straight (unbent) area of the same conductor. A similar skin effect occurs at the corners of rectangular conductors (viewed in cross-section), where the magnetic field is more concentrated at the corners than in the sides. This results in superior performance (i.e. higher current with lower temperature rise) from wide thin conductors \u2013 e.g. \"ribbon\" conductors, where the effects from corners is effectively eliminated.\n\nIt follows that a transformer with a round core will be more efficient than an equivalent-rated transformer having a square or rectangular core of the same material.\n\nSolid or tubular conductors may be [[silver]]-[[Electroplating|plated]] to take advantage of silver's higher conductivity. This technique is particularly used at [[VHF]] to [[microwave]] frequencies where the small skin depth requires only a very thin layer of silver, making the improvement in conductivity very cost effective. Silver plating is similarly used on the surface of waveguides used for transmission of microwaves. This reduces attenuation of the propagating wave due to resistive losses affecting the accompanying eddy currents; the skin effect confines such eddy currents to a very thin surface layer of the waveguide structure. The skin effect itself isn't actually combatted in these cases, but the distribution of currents near the conductor's surface makes the use of precious metals (having a lower resistivity) practical. Although it has a lower conductivity than copper and silver, gold plating is also used, because unlike copper and silver, it does not corrode. A thin corroded layer of copper or silver would have a low conductivity, and so would cause large power losses as the majority of the current would still flow through this layer.\n\nNOTE: The heat-dependent manufacturing process for wire results in oxidation of the surface in the finished product. Therefore, the conductivity of the skin is significantly less than the underlying unoxidised base metal. It is to be expected that unless the oxidised surface material is removed, some loss of performance from the theoretical model will occur.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n[[File:Skin depth by Zureks.png|thumb|350px|Skin depth vs. frequency for some materials at room temperature, red vertical line denotes 50&nbsp;Hz frequency:{{ubl\n|Mn-Zn \u2013 magnetically soft [[Ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]]\n|Al \u2013 metallic [[aluminum]]\n|Cu \u2013 metallic [[copper]]\n|steel 410 \u2013 magnetic [[stainless steel]]\n|Fe-Si \u2013 [[grain-oriented electrical steel]]\n|Fe-Ni \u2013 high-permeability [[permalloy]] (80%Ni-20%Fe)\n}}\n]]\n\nWe can derive a practical formula for skin depth as follows:\n\n: <math>\\delta=\\sqrt{{2\\rho }\\over{(2 \\pi f) (\\mu_0 \\mu_r)}} \\approx 503\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho}{\\mu_r f}}</math>\n\nwhere\n\n: <math>\\delta = </math> the skin depth in meters\n: <math>\\mu_r = </math> the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|relative permeability]] of the medium\n: <math>\\rho = </math> the resistivity of the medium in \u03a9\u00b7m, also equal to the reciprocal of its conductivity: <math>\\rho = 1/ \\sigma  </math> (for copper, \u03c1 = {{val|1.68|e=-8|u=\u03a9\u00b7m}})\n: <math>f = </math> the frequency of the current in Hz\n\n[[Gold]] is a good conductor with a resistivity of {{val|2.44|e=-8|u=\u03a9\u00b7m}} and is essentially nonmagnetic: <math>\\mu_r = </math> 1, so its skin depth at a frequency of 50&nbsp;Hz is given by\n\n: <math>\\delta = 503 \\,\\sqrt{\\frac{2.44 \\cdot 10^{-8}}{1 \\cdot 50}}= 11.1\\,\\mathrm{mm} </math>\n\n[[Lead]], in contrast, is a relatively poor conductor (among metals) with a resistivity of {{val|2.2|e=-7|u=\u03a9\u00b7m}}, about 9 times that of gold. Its skin depth at 50&nbsp;Hz is likewise found to be about 33&nbsp;mm, or\n<math>\\sqrt{9} = 3 </math> times that of gold.\n\nHighly magnetic materials have a reduced skin depth owing to their large permeability <math>\\mu_r</math> as was pointed out above for the case of iron, despite its poorer conductivity. A practical consequence is seen by users of [[induction cooker]]s, where some types of [[stainless steel]] cookware are unusable because they are not ferromagnetic.<ref>If the permeability is low, the skin depth is so large that the resistance encountered by eddy currents is too low to provide enough heat</ref>\n\nAt very high frequencies the skin depth for good conductors becomes tiny. For instance, the skin depths of some common metals at a frequency of 10&nbsp;GHz (microwave region) are less than a [[micrometre|micrometer]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Skin depth at microwave frequencies\n|-\n!

Ohmic losses of waveguides at microwave frequencies are therefore only dependent on the surface coating of the material. A layer of silver 3&nbsp;[[\u03bcm]] thick evaporated on a piece of glass is thus an excellent conductor at such frequencies.\n\nIn copper, the skin depth can be seen to fall according to the square root of frequency:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Skin depth in copper\n|-\n!

Since the skin effect causes a current at high frequencies to flow mainly at the surface of a conductor, it can be seen that this will reduce the magnetic field ''inside'' the wire, that is, beneath the depth at which the bulk of the current flows. It can be shown that this will have a minor effect on the self-inductance of the wire itself; see Skilling<ref name=\"Skilling157_159\">{{Harvtxt|Skilling|1951|pp=157\u2013159}}</ref> or Hayt<ref name=\"Hayt434_439\">{{Harvtxt|Hayt|1981|pp=434\u2013439}}</ref> for a mathematical treatment of this phenomenon.\n\nNote that the inductance considered in this context refers to a bare conductor, not the inductance of a coil used as a circuit element. The inductance of a coil is dominated by the mutual inductance between the turns of the coil which increases its inductance according to the square of the number of turns. However, when only a single wire is involved, then in addition to the \"external inductance\" involving magnetic fields outside of the wire (due to the total current in the wire) as seen in the white region of the figure below, there is also a much smaller component of \"internal inductance\" due to the magnetic field inside the wire itself, the green region in  figure B. In a single wire the internal inductance becomes of little significance when the wire is much much longer than its diameter. The presence of a second conductor in the case of a transmission line requires a different treatment as is discussed below.\n\nDue to the skin effect, at high frequencies the internal inductance of a wire vanishes, as can be seen in the case of a telephone twisted pair, below. In normal cases the effect of internal inductance is ignored in the design of coils or calculating the properties of [[microstrip]]s.\n\n=== Inductance per length in a coaxial cable ===\n\nLet the dimensions ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' be the inner conductor radius, the shield (outer conductor) inside radius and the shield outer radius respectively, as seen in the crossection of figure A below.\n\n[[File:Coax and Skin Depth.svg|center|thumb|800px|Four stages of skin effect in a coax showing the effect on inductance.

The four stages, ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'' are non-energized, low frequency, middle frequency and high frequency respectively. There are three regions that may contain induced magnetic fields: the center conductor, the dielectric and the outer conductor. In stage ''B'', current covers the conductors uniformly and there is a significant magnetic field in all three regions. As the frequency is increased and the skin effect takes hold (''C'' and ''D'') the magnetic field in the dielectric region is unchanged as it is proportional to the total current flowing in the center conductor. In ''C'', however, there is a reduced magnetic field in the deeper sections of the inner conductor and the outer sections of the shield (outer conductor). Thus there is less energy stored in the magnetic field given the same total current, corresponding to a reduced inductance. At an even higher frequency, ''D'', the skin depth is tiny: all current is confined to the surface of the conductors. The only magnetic field is in the regions between the conductors; only the \"external inductance\" remains.]]\n\nFor a given current, the total energy stored in the magnetic fields must be the same as the calculated electrical energy attributed to that current flowing through the inductance of the coax; that energy is proportional to the cable's measured inductance.\n\nThe magnetic field inside a coaxial cable can be divided into three regions, each of which will therefore contribute to the electrical inductance seen by a length of cable.<ref name=\"Hayt434\">{{Harvtxt|Hayt|1981|p=434}}</ref>\n\nThe inductance  <math> L_\\text{cen} \\, </math> is associated with the magnetic field in the region with radius <math> r < a \\, </math>, the region inside the center conductor.\n\nThe inductance  <math> L_\\text{ext} \\, </math> is associated with the magnetic field in the region <math> a < r < b \\, </math>, the region between the two conductors (containing a dielectric, possibly air).\n\nThe inductance  <math> L_\\text{shd} \\, </math> is associated with the magnetic field in the region <math> b < r < c \\, </math>, the region inside the shield conductor.\n\nThe net electrical inductance is due to all three contributions:\n\n:<math> L_\\text{total} = L_\\text{cen} + L_\\text{shd} + L_\\text{ext}\\, </math>\n\n<math> L_\\text{ext} \\, </math> is not changed by the skin effect and is given by the frequently cited formula for inductance ''L'' per length ''D'' of a coaxial cable:\n\n:<math> L/D = \\frac{\\mu_0}{2 \\pi} \\ln  \\left( \\frac {b}{a}  \\right)   \\, </math>\n\nAt low frequencies, all three inductances are fully present so that <math> L_\\text{DC} = L_\\text{cen} + L_\\text{shd} + L_\\text{ext}\\, </math>.\n\nAt high frequencies, only the dielectric region has magnetic flux, so that  <math> L_\\infty = L_\\text{ext}\\, </math>.\n\nMost discussions of coaxial transmission lines assume they will be used for radio frequencies, so equations are supplied corresponding only to the latter case.\n\nAs the skin effect increases, the currents are concentrated near the outside of the inner conductor (''r''=''a'') and the inside of the shield (''r''=''b''). Since there is essentially no current deeper in the inner conductor, there is no magnetic field beneath the surface of the inner conductor. Since the current in the inner conductor is balanced by the opposite current flowing on the inside of the outer conductor, there is no remaining magnetic field in the outer conductor itself where  <math> b < r < c \\, </math>. Only <math> L_\\text{ext} </math> contributes to the electrical inductance at these higher frequencies.\n\nAlthough the geometry is different, a twisted pair used in telephone lines is similarly affected: at higher frequencies the inductance decreases by more than 20% as can be seen in the following table.\n\n=== Characteristics of telephone cable as a function of frequency ===\n\nRepresentative parameter data for 24 gauge PIC telephone cable at {{convert|21|C|F}}.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
