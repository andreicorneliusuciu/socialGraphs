It occurs when the sum of the [[Drag (physics)|drag]] force (''F<sub>d</sub>'') and the [[buoyancy]] is equal to the downward force of [[gravity]] (''F<sub>G</sub>'') acting on the object. Since the [[net force]] on the object is zero, the object has zero [[acceleration]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n| publisher = NASA Glenn Research Center\n| title = Terminal Velocity\n| url = http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/termv.html\n| accessdate = March 4, 2009\n}}</ref>\n\nIn [[fluid dynamics]], an object is moving at its terminal velocity if its [[speed]] is constant due to the restraining force exerted by the fluid through which it is moving.\n\nAs the speed of an object increases, so does the drag force acting on it, which also depends on the substance it is passing through (for example air or water). At some speed, the drag or force of resistance will equal the gravitational pull on the object (buoyancy is considered below). At this point the object ceases to accelerate and continues falling at a constant speed called the terminal velocity (also called settling velocity). An object moving downward faster than the terminal velocity (for example because it was thrown downwards, it fell from a thinner part of the atmosphere, or it changed shape) will slow down until it reaches the terminal velocity. Drag depends on the [[projected area]], here, the object's cross-section or silhouette in a horizontal plane. An object with a large projected area relative to its mass, such as a parachute, has a lower terminal velocity than one with a small projected area relative to its mass, such as a bullet.\n\n==Examples==\nBased on wind resistance, for example, the terminal velocity of a [[skydiving|skydiver]] in a belly-to-earth (i.e., face down) [[free-fall]] position is about 195&nbsp;[[km/h]] (122&nbsp;[[Miles per hour|mph]] or 54&nbsp;[[m/s]]).<ref name=\"Huang1999\">{{cite web |url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/JianHuang.shtml |last=Huang |first=Jian |work=The Physics Factbook |publisher=Glenn Elert, Midwood High School, Brooklyn College |title=Speed of a Skydiver (Terminal Velocity) |year=1999}}</ref> This velocity is the [[asymptote|asymptotic]] limiting value of the velocity, and the forces acting on the body balance each other more and more closely as the terminal velocity is approached. In this example, a speed of 50% of terminal velocity is reached after only about 3 seconds, while it takes 8 seconds to reach 90%, 15 seconds to reach 99% and so on.\n\nHigher speeds can be attained if the skydiver pulls in his or her limbs (see also [[freeflying]]). In this case, the terminal velocity increases to about 320&nbsp;km/h (200&nbsp;mph or 90&nbsp;m/s),<ref name=\"Huang1999\" /> which is almost the terminal velocity of the [[peregrine falcon]] diving down on its prey.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fws.gov/endangered/recovery/peregrine/QandA.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308202440/http://www.fws.gov/endangered/recovery/peregrine/QandA.html|title=All About the Peregrine Falcon (archived) |publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |date=December 20, 2007|archivedate=March 8, 2010}}</ref> The same terminal velocity is reached for a typical [[.30-06 Springfield|.30-06]] bullet dropping downwards\u2014when it is returning to the ground having been fired upwards, or dropped from a tower\u2014according to a 1920 U.S. Army Ordnance study.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.loadammo.com/Topics/March01.htm |title=Bullets in the Sky |author=The Ballistician |publisher=W.

So instead of <math>m</math> use the reduced mass <math>m_r=m-\\rho V</math> in this and subsequent formulas.\n\nThe terminal velocity of an object changes due to the properties of the fluid, the mass of the object and its projected cross-sectional [[surface area]].\n\nAir density increases with decreasing altitude, at about 1% per {{convert|80|m|ft}} (see [[barometric formula]]). For objects falling through the atmosphere, for every {{convert|160|m|ft}} of fall, the terminal velocity decreases 1%. After reaching the local terminal velocity, while continuing the fall, speed ''decreases'' to change with the local terminal velocity.\n\n===Derivation for terminal velocity===\n\nMathematically, defining down to be positive, the net force acting on an object falling near the surface of Earth is (according to the [[drag equation]]):\n:<math>F_{net} = m a = m g - {1 \\over 2} \\rho v^2 A C_\\mathrm{d}</math>\n\nAt [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]], the [[net force]] is zero (F = 0);\n:<math>m g - {1 \\over 2} \\rho v^2 A C_\\mathrm{d} = 0</math>\n\nSolving for ''v'' yields\n:<math>v = \\sqrt\\frac{2mg}{\\rho A C_\\mathrm{d}}</math>\n\n{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"90%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!Derivation of the solution for the velocity ''v'' as a function of time ''t''\n|-\n|\nThe drag equation is\n:<math> m a = m \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v}{\\mathrm{d}t} = m g - \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v^2 A C_\\mathrm{d}</math>\n\nAlthough this is a [[Riccati equation]] that can be solved by reduction to a second-order linear differential equation, it is easier to [[Separation of variables|separate variables]].\n\nA more practical form of this equation can be obtained by making the substitution ''k'' = {{frac|1|2}}''\u03c1AC''<sub>d</sub>.\n\nDividing both sides by ''m'' gives\n:<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}v}{\\mathrm{d}t}=g-\\frac{kv^2}{m}</math>\n\nThe equation can be re-arranged into\n:<math>dt = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v}{g - \\frac{kv^2}{m}}</math>\n\nTaking the integral of both sides yields\n:<math>\\int_0^t {\\mathrm{d}t^\\prime} = \\int_0^v \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v^\\prime}{g-\\frac{kv^{\\prime 2}}{m}} = {1 \\over g}\\int_0^v \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v^\\prime}{1-\\alpha^2 v^{\\prime 2}}</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03b1'' = ( {{frac|''k''|''mg''}} )<sup>{{frac|1|2}}</sup>.\n\nAfter integration, this becomes\n:<math>t - 0 = {1 \\over g}\\left[{\\ln(1 + \\alpha v^\\prime) \\over 2\\alpha} - \\frac{\\ln(1 - \\alpha v^\\prime)}{2\\alpha} + C \\right]_{v^\\prime=0}^{v^\\prime=v}={1 \\over g} \\left[{\\ln \\frac{1 + \\alpha v^\\prime}{1 - \\alpha v^\\prime} \\over 2\\alpha} + C \\right]_{v^\\prime=0}^{v^\\prime=v}</math>\n\nor in simpler a form\n:<math>t = {1 \\over 2\\alpha g} \\ln \\frac{1 + \\alpha v}{1 - \\alpha v}</math>\n\nThe [[inverse hyperbolic tangent]] is defined as:\n:<math>\\frac{1}{2} \\ln \\frac{1+\\alpha v}{1-\\alpha v}=\\mathrm{arctanh}(\\alpha v)</math>\n\nSo the solution of the integral is\n:<math>t = \\frac{\\mathrm{arctanh}(\\alpha v)}{\\alpha g}</math>\n\nor alternatively,\n:<math>\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\tanh(\\alpha g t) = v</math>\n\nwith tanh the [[hyperbolic tangent]] function. Assuming that ''g'' is positive (which it was defined to be), and substituting ''\u03b1'' back in, the velocity ''v'' becomes\n:<math> v=\\sqrt{\\frac{mg}{k}} \\tanh \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{mg}} g t\\right)</math>\n\nNext, after ''k'' = {{frac|1|2}}''\u03c1AC''<sub>d</sub> has been substituted, the velocity ''v'' is in the desired form:\n:<math>v = \\sqrt\\frac{2mg}{\\rho A C_d} \\tanh \\left(t \\sqrt{\\frac{g \\rho A C_d }{2m}}\\right)</math>\n\nAs time tends to infinity ( ''t'' \u2192 \u221e ), the hyperbolic tangent tends to 1, resulting in the terminal velocity\n:<math> v = \\sqrt\\frac{2mg}{\\rho A C_d}</math>\n|}\n\n===Terminal velocity in creeping flow===\n[[Image:Stokes sphere.svg|thumb|right|200px|Creeping flow past a sphere: [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|streamlines]], drag force ''F''<sub>d</sub> and force by gravity ''F''<sub>g</sub>]]\nFor very slow motion of the fluid, the inertia forces of the fluid are negligible (assumption of massless fluid) in comparison to other forces. Such flows are called [[Stokes flow|creeping flows]] and the condition to be satisfied for the flows to be creeping flows is the [[Reynolds number]], <math>Re \\ll 1</math>. The equation of motion for creeping flow (simplified [[Navier-Stokes equation]]) is given by\n\n:<math>\\nabla p = \\mu \\nabla^2 {\\mathbf v} </math>\n\nwhere\n*<math>{\\mathbf v}</math> is the fluid velocity vector field\n*<math>p</math> is the fluid pressure field\n*<math>\\mu</math> is the fluid [[viscosity]]\n\nThe analytical solution for the creeping flow around a sphere was first given by [[George Gabriel Stokes|Stokes]] in 1851. From Stokes' solution, the drag force acting on the sphere can be obtained as\n:<math>\\quad (6) \\qquad D = 3\\pi \\mu d V \\qquad \\qquad \\text{or} \\qquad \\qquad C_d = \\frac{24}{Re} </math>\n\nwhere the Reynolds number, <math>Re = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\rho d V</math>. The expression for the drag force given by equation (6) is called [[Stokes' law]].\n\nWhen the value of <math>C_d</math> is substituted in the equation (5), we obtain the expression for terminal velocity of a spherical object moving under creeping flow conditions:\n:<math>V_t = \\frac{g d^2}{18 \\mu} \\left(\\rho_s - \\rho \\right)</math>\n\n====Applications====\n\nThe creeping flow results can be applied in order to study the settling of sediments near the ocean bottom and the fall of moisture drops in the atmosphere. The principle is also applied in the [[Viscometer#Falling sphere viscometers|falling sphere viscometer]], an experimental device used to measure the viscosity of highly viscous fluids, for example oil, parrafin, tar etc.\n\n===Finding the terminal velocity when the drag coefficient is not known===\n\nIn principle one doesn't know beforehand whether to apply the creeping flow solution, or what coefficient of drag to use, because the coefficient depends on the speed. What one can do in this situation is to calculate the product of the coefficient of drag and the square of the [[Reynolds number]]:\n:<math>C_d \\mathrm{Re}^2 = \\frac{mgD^2}{A\\rho\\nu^2}</math>\n\nwhere \u03bd is the [[kinematic viscosity]], equal to \u03bc/\u03c1. This product is a function of Reynolds number, and one can consult a graph of C<sub>d</sub> versus Re to find where along the curve the product attains the correct value (a qualitative example of such a graph for spheres is found at this NASA site: [http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/dragsphere.html]) From this one knows the coefficient of drag and one can then use the formula given above to find the terminal velocity.\n\n'''For a spherical object, the above-mentioned product can be simplified:'''\n:<math>C_d \\mathrm{Re}^2 = \\frac{4mg}{\\pi\\rho\\nu^2}</math>\n\nWe can see from this that the regime and the drag coefficient depend only on the sphere's weight and the fluid properties. There are three regimes: creeping flow, intermediate-Reynolds number Newton's Law (almost constant drag coefficient), and a high-Reynolds number regime.<ref>{{cite book |title=Chemical Engineer's Handbook |editor1=[[Robert H. Perry]] |editor2=[[Cecil Chilton]] |edition=fifth |isbn=978-0070494787 |pages=5\u201362}}</ref> In the latter regime the boundary layer is everywhere turbulent (see [[Golf ball#Aerodynamics]]). These regimes are given in the following table. The weight range for each regime is given for water and air at 1 [[atm (unit)|atm]] pressure and 25&nbsp;\u00b0C. Note though that the weight (given in terms of mass in [[standard gravity]]) is the weight in the fluid, which is less than the mass times the local gravity because of buoyancy.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

But notice that there is overlap between the ranges of C<sub>d</sub>Re<sup>2</sup> for the last two regimes. Spheres in this weight range have two stable terminal velocities.
