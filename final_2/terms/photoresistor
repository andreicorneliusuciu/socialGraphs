The [[electrical resistance|resistance]] of a photoresistor decreases with increasing incident light intensity; in other words, it exhibits [[photoconductivity]]. A photoresistor can be applied in light-sensitive detector circuits, and light- and dark-activated switching circuits. \n\nA photoresistor is made of a high resistance [[semiconductor]]. In the dark, a photoresistor can have a resistance as high as several megohms (M\u03a9), while in the light, a photoresistor can have a resistance as low as a few hundred ohms. If incident light on a photoresistor exceeds a certain [[frequency]], [[photon]]s absorbed by the semiconductor give bound [[electron]]s enough energy to jump into the [[conduction band]]. The resulting free electrons (and their [[electron hole|hole]] partners) conduct electricity, thereby lowering [[Electrical resistance|resistance]]. The resistance range and sensitivity of a photoresistor can substantially differ among dissimilar devices. Moreover, unique photoresistors may react substantially differently to photons within certain wavelength bands.\n\nA photoelectric device can be either intrinsic or extrinsic. An intrinsic semiconductor has its own [[charge carrier]]s and is not an efficient semiconductor, for example, silicon. In intrinsic devices the only available electrons are in the [[valence band]], and hence the photon must have enough energy to excite the electron across the entire [[bandgap]]. Extrinsic devices have impurities, also called [[dopants]], added whose ground state energy is closer to the conduction band; since the electrons do not have as far to jump, lower energy photons (that is, longer wavelengths and lower frequencies) are sufficient to trigger the device. If a sample of silicon has some of its atoms replaced by phosphorus atoms (impurities), there will be extra electrons available for conduction. This is an example of an extrinsic semiconductor.<ref>{{cite book|last=Diffenderfes|first=Robert|title=Electronic Devices: System and Applications|year=2005|publisher=Delimar|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-1401835149|pages=480}}</ref>\n\n==Design considerations==\n[[File:Photoresistors - three sizes - mm scale.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Three photoresistors with scale in mm]]\n[[File:CdS Photocell.jpg|thumb|Large CdS Photocell from a street light.]]\nPhotoresistors are less light-sensitive devices than [[photodiode]]s or [[phototransistor]]s: the two latter components are true [[semiconductor device]]s, while a photoresistor is a passive component and does not have a [[p\u2013n junction|PN-junction]].  The photoresistivity of any photoresistor may vary widely depending on ambient temperature, making them unsuitable for applications requiring precise measurement of or sensitivity to light.\n\nPhotoresistors also exhibit a certain degree of [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] between exposure to light and the subsequent decrease in resistance, usually around 10 milliseconds. The lag time when going from lit to dark environments is even greater, often as long as one second. This property makes them unsuitable for sensing rapidly flashing lights, but is sometimes used to smooth the response of audio signal compression.<ref>http://www.resistorguide.com/photoresistor/</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n[[Image:Streetlight control.jpg|thumb|The internal components of a photoelectric control for a typical American [[streetlight]]. The photoresistor is facing rightwards, and controls whether current flows through the heater which opens the main power contacts. At night, the heater cools, closing the power contacts, energizing the street light.]]\n\nPhotoresistors come in many types. Inexpensive [[cadmium sulphide]] cells can be found in many consumer items such as camera light meters, clock radios, [[alarm devices]] (as the detector for a light beam), [[nightlight]]s, outdoor clocks, solar street lamps and solar road studs, etc.\n\nPhotoresistors can be placed in streetlights to control when the light is on. Ambient light falling on the photoresistor causes the streetlight to turn off. Thus energy is saved by ensuring the light is only on during hours of darkness.\n\nThey are also used in some [[Dynamic_range_compression|dynamic compressors]] together with a small [[incandescent lamp|incandescent]] or [[neon]] [[neon lamp|lamp]], or [[light-emitting diode]] to control gain reduction. A common usage of this application can be found in many [[guitar amplifiers]] that incorporate an onboard [[Tremolo (electronic effect)|tremolo]] effect, as the oscillating light patterns control the level of signal running through the amp circuit.\n\nThe use of CdS and [[Cadmium selenide|CdSe]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.silonex.com/datasheets/specs/images/pdf/102899.pdf |title= Silonex: ''TO-18 photocells on ceramic substrate'' |format=PDF |accessdate=17 October 2013}}</ref> photoresistors is severely restricted in Europe due to the [[Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive|RoHS]] ban on [[cadmium]].\n\n[[Lead sulphide]] (PbS) and [[indium antimonide]] (InSb) LDRs (light-dependent resistors) are used for the mid-infrared spectral region. [[germanium|Ge]]:[[copper|Cu]] photoconductors are among the best far-[[infrared]] detectors available, and are used for [[infrared astronomy]] and [[infrared spectroscopy]].\n\nCH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>(Mn:Pb)I<sub>3</sub> a magnetic photoresistor developed in 2016.<ref name=\"Nafradi2016\">{{cite journal|last1=N\u00e1fr\u00e1di|first1=B\u00e1lint|title=Optically switched magnetism in photovoltaic perovskite CH3NH3(Mn:Pb)I3|journal=Nature Communications|date=24 November 2016|volume=7|page=13406|doi=10.1038/ncomms13406|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13406}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Optoelectronics]]\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Photoresistors}}\n* [http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/06/adem/engin/e72/lab7/ Using a photoresistor to track light]\n* [http://www.acroname.com/howto/photoresistor/photoresistor.html Connecting a photoresistor to a circuit]\n* [http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/data/resistor/ldr/light_dependent_resistor.php Photoresistor overview] - detailing operation, structure and circuit information\n\n{{Sensors}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Resistive components]]\n[[Category:Optical devices]]\n[[Category:Sensors]]"}]}}}}
