Electronics deals with [[electrical circuit]]s that involve [[active component|active electrical component]]s such as [[vacuum tube]]s, [[transistor]]s, [[diode]]s, [[integrated circuit]]s, associated passive electrical components, and interconnection technologies. Commonly, electronic devices contain circuitry consisting primarily or exclusively of active [[semiconductor]]s supplemented with passive elements; such a circuit is described as an [[electronic circuit]].\n\nThe science of Electronics is also considered to be a branch of [[Physics]] and [[Electrical Engineering]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/electronics|title= Electronics, Encyclopedia Britannica|last=|first=|date=September 2016|website=|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[nonlinear]] behaviour of active components and their ability to control electron flows makes amplification of weak signals possible, and electronics is widely used in [[information processing]], [[telecommunication]], and [[signal processing]]. The ability of electronic devices to act as [[switch]]es makes digital information processing possible. Interconnection technologies such as [[circuit board]]s, electronics packaging technology, and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed components into a regular working [[system]].\n\nElectronics is distinct from [[electricity|electrical]] and [[electro-mechanical]] science and technology, which deal with the generation, distribution, switching, storage, and conversion of electrical energy to and from other energy forms using [[wire]]s, [[Electric motor|motors]], [[Electric generator|generator]]s, [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], [[switch]]es, [[relay]]s, [[transformer]]s, [[resistor]]s, and other [[passive component]]s. This distinction started around 1906 with the invention by [[Lee De Forest]] of the [[triode]], which made electrical [[Amplifier|amplification]] of weak radio signals and audio signals possible with a non-mechanical device. Until 1950 this field was called \"radio technology\" because its principal application was the design and theory of radio [[transmitter]]s, [[Receiver (radio)|receivers]], and [[vacuum tube]]s.\n\nToday, most electronic devices use [[semiconductor]] components to perform electron control. The study of semiconductor devices and related technology is considered a branch of [[solid-state physics]], whereas the design and construction of [[electronic circuit]]s to solve practical problems come under [[electronics engineering]]. This article focuses on [[engineering]] aspects of electronics.\n\n== Branches of electronics ==\n\nElectronics has branches as follows:\n\n#[[Digital electronics]]\n#[[Analogue electronics]]\n#[[Microelectronics]]\n#[[Circuit design]]\n#[[Integrated circuit]]s\n#[[Optoelectronics]]\n#[[Semiconductor device]]s\n#[[Embedded system]]s\n\n== Electronic devices and components ==\n[[File:US Navy 080820-N-9079D-007 Electronics Technician 3rd Class Michael J.

Components are generally intended to be connected together, usually by being soldered to a [[printed circuit board]] (PCB), to create an electronic circuit with a particular function (for example an [[amplifier]], [[radio receiver]], or [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]]). Components may be packaged singly, or in more complex groups as [[integrated circuit]]s. Some common electronic components are [[capacitor]]s, [[inductor]]s, [[resistor]]s, [[diode]]s, [[transistor]]s, etc. Components are often categorized as active (e.g. transistors and [[thyristor]]s) or [[Passivity (engineering)|passive]] (e.g. resistors, diodes, inductors and capacitors).\n\n== History of electronic components ==\n{{Further|Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering}}\n[[Vacuum tube]]s (Thermionic valves) were among the earliest electronic components.  They were almost solely responsible for the electronics revolution of the first half of the Twentieth Century.  They took electronics from parlor tricks and gave us radio, television, phonographs, radar, long distance telephony and much more.  They played a leading role in the field of microwave and high power transmission as well as television receivers until the middle of the 1980s.<ref name=\"Okamura1994\">{{cite book|author=S\u014dgo Okamura|title=History of Electron Tubes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHFyngmO95YC&pg=PR4|accessdate=5 December 2012|year=1994|publisher=IOS Press|isbn=978-90-5199-145-1|page=5}}</ref>  Since that time, solid state devices have all but completely taken over. Vacuum tubes are still used in some specialist applications such as [[valve RF amplifier|high power RF amplifiers]], [[cathode ray tube]]s, specialist audio equipment, [[guitar amplifiers]] and some [[cavity magnetron|microwave devices]].\n\nIn April 1955 the [[IBM 608]] was the first IBM product to use transistor circuits without any vacuum tubes and is believed to be the world's first all-transistorized calculator to be manufactured for the commercial market.<ref>{{cite book |last= Bashe |first= Charles J.  |title=IBM's Early Computers |publisher= MIT |year= 1986 |page=386 |ref=harv |display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Pugh |first1=Emerson W. |last2=Johnson |first2=Lyle R. |last3=Palmer |first3=John H. |year=1991 |title=IBM's 360 and early 370 systems |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0-262-16123-0 |page=34 |ref=harv }}</ref> The 608 contained more than 3,000 [[germanium]] [[transistor]]s.  [[Thomas J. Watson Jr.]] ordered all future IBM products to use transistors in their design.  From that time on transistors were almost exclusively used for computer logic and peripherals.\n\n== Types of circuits ==\nCircuits and components can be divided into two groups: analog and digital. A particular device may consist of circuitry that has one or the other or a mix of the two types.\n\n=== Analog circuits ===\n{{Main|Analog electronics}}\n[[File:HitachiJ100A.jpg|right|thumb|Hitachi J100 adjustable frequency drive chassis]]\nMost [[analog signal|analog]] electronic appliances, such as [[radio]] receivers, are constructed from combinations of a few types of basic circuits. [[Analog circuits]] use a continuous range of voltage or current as opposed to discrete levels as in digital circuits.\n\nThe number of different analog circuits so far devised is huge, especially because a 'circuit' can be defined as anything from a single component, to systems containing thousands of components.\n\nAnalog circuits are sometimes called [[linear circuit]]s although many non-linear effects are used in analog circuits such as mixers, modulators, etc. Good examples of analog circuits include vacuum tube and transistor amplifiers, operational amplifiers and oscillators.\n\nOne rarely finds modern circuits that are entirely analog. These days analog circuitry may use digital or even microprocessor techniques to improve performance. This type of circuit is usually called \"mixed signal\" rather than analog or digital.\n\nSometimes it may be difficult to differentiate between analog and digital circuits as they have elements of both linear and non-linear operation. An example is the comparator which takes in a continuous range of voltage but only outputs one of two levels as in a digital circuit. Similarly, an overdriven transistor amplifier can take on the characteristics of a controlled [[switch]] having essentially two levels of output.  In fact, many digital circuits are actually implemented as variations of analog circuits similar to this example&mdash;after all, all aspects of the real physical world are essentially analog, so digital effects are only realized by constraining analog behavior.\n\n=== Digital circuits ===\n{{Main|Digital electronics}}\nDigital circuits are electric circuits based on a number of discrete voltage levels. Digital circuits are the most common physical representation of [[Boolean logic|Boolean algebra]], and are the basis of all digital computers. To most engineers, the terms \"digital circuit\", \"digital system\" and \"logic\" are interchangeable in the context of digital circuits.\nMost digital circuits use a binary system with two voltage levels labeled \"0\" and \"1\". Often logic \"0\" will be a lower voltage and referred to as \"Low\" while logic \"1\" is referred to as \"High\".  However, some systems use the reverse definition (\"0\" is \"High\") or are current based.  Quite often the logic designer may reverse these definitions from one circuit to the next as he sees fit to facilitate his design.  The definition of the levels as \"0\" or \"1\" is arbitrary.\n\n[[Ternary computer|Ternary]] (with three states) logic has been studied, and some prototype computers made.\n\n[[Computer]]s, electronic [[quartz clock|clocks]], and [[programmable logic controller]]s (used to control industrial processes) are constructed of [[Digital data|digital]] circuits. [[Digital signal processor]]s are another example.\n\nBuilding blocks:\n* [[Logic gate]]s\n* [[Adder (electronics)|Adders]]\n* [[Flip-flop (electronics)|Flip-flops]]\n* [[Counter (digital)|Counter]]s\n* [[Processor register|Registers]]\n* [[Multiplexer]]s\n* [[Schmitt trigger]]s\n\nHighly integrated devices:\n* [[Microprocessor]]s\n* [[Microcontroller]]s\n* [[Application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASIC)\n* [[Digital signal processor]] (DSP)\n* [[Field-programmable gate array]] (FPGA)\n\n== Heat dissipation and thermal management ==\n{{Main|Thermal management of electronic devices and systems}}\n[[Heat]] generated by electronic circuitry must be dissipated to prevent immediate failure and improve long term reliability. Heat dissipation is mostly achieved by passive conduction/convection. Means to achieve greater dissipation include [[heat sink]]s and [[Mechanical fan|fans]] for air cooling, and other forms of [[computer cooling]] such as [[water cooling]]. These techniques use [[convection]], [[Heat conduction|conduction]], and [[radiation]] of heat energy.\n\n== Noise ==\n{{Main|Electronic noise}}\nElectronic noise is defined<ref>IEEE Dictionary of Electrical and Electronics Terms ISBN 978-0-471-42806-0</ref> as unwanted disturbances superposed on a useful signal that tend to obscure its information content. Noise is not the same as signal distortion caused by a circuit. Noise is associated with all electronic circuits. Noise may be electromagnetically or thermally generated, which can be decreased by lowering the [[operating temperature]] of the circuit. Other types of noise, such as [[shot noise]] cannot be removed as they are due to limitations in physical properties.\n\n== Electronics theory ==\n{{Main|Mathematical methods in electronics}}\n\nMathematical methods are integral to the study of electronics. To become proficient in electronics it is also necessary to become proficient in the mathematics of circuit analysis.\n\nCircuit analysis is the study of methods of solving generally linear systems for unknown variables such as the voltage at a certain [[Node (circuits)|node]] or the current through a certain [[Path (graph theory)|branch]] of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|network]]. A common analytical tool for this is the [[SPICE]] circuit simulator.\n\nAlso important to electronics is the study and understanding of [[electromagnetic field]] theory.\n\n== Electronics lab ==\n{{Main|Electronic circuit simulation}}\n\nDue to the complex nature of electronics theory, laboratory experimentation is an important part of the development of electronic devices.  These experiments are used to test or verify the engineer\u2019s design and detect errors.  Historically, electronics labs have consisted of electronics devices and equipment located in a physical space, although in more recent years the trend has been towards electronics lab simulation software, such as [[CircuitLogix]], [[Multisim]], and [[PSpice]].\n\n== Computer aided design (CAD) ==\n{{Main|Electronic design automation}}\n\nToday's electronics engineers have the ability to [[Circuit design|design]] [[Electronic circuit|circuits]] using premanufactured building blocks such as [[power supply|power supplies]], [[semiconductor]]s (i.e. semiconductor devices, such as [[transistor]]s), and [[integrated circuit]]s. [[Electronic design automation]] software programs include [[schematic capture]] programs and [[printed circuit board]] design programs. Popular names in the EDA software world are NI Multisim, Cadence ([[ORCAD]]), [[EAGLE (program)|EAGLE]] PCB and Schematic, Mentor (PADS PCB and LOGIC Schematic), Altium (Protel), LabCentre Electronics (Proteus), gEDA, KiCad and many others.\n\n== Construction methods ==\n{{Main|Electronic packaging}}\nMany different methods of connecting components have been used over the years. For instance, early electronics often used [[Point-to-point construction|point to point wiring]] with components attached to wooden breadboards to construct circuits. [[Printed circuit board#\"Cordwood\" construction|Cordwood construction]] and [[wire wrap]] were other methods used. Most modern day electronics now use printed circuit boards made of materials such as [[FR-4|FR4]], or the cheaper (and less hard-wearing) Synthetic Resin Bonded Paper ([[SRBP]], also known as Paxoline/Paxolin (trade marks) and FR2) - characterised by its brown colour. Health and environmental concerns associated with electronics assembly have gained increased attention in recent years, especially for products destined to the European Union, with its [[Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive]] (RoHS) and [[Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive]] (WEEE), which went into force in July 2006.\n\n== Degradation ==\n\n[[Rasberry crazy ant]]s have been known to consume the insides of electrical wiring, and nest inside of electronics; they prefer [[Direct current|DC]] to [[Alternating current|AC]] currents. This behavior is not well understood by scientists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/207800337/crazy-ant-invasion-frying-computer-equipment.htm|title='Crazy' Ant Invasion Frying Computer Equipment|author=Andrew R Hickey|date=May 15, 2008}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wikipedia books|An introduction to electronics}}\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n* [[Outline of electronics]]\n{{cmn|3|\n* [[Atomtronics]]\n* [[Audio engineering]]\n* [[Broadcast engineering]]\n* [[Computer engineering]]\n* [[Electronic engineering]]\n* [[Electronics engineering technology]]\n* [[Fuzzy electronics]]\n* [[Index of electronics articles]]\n* [[List of mechanical, electrical and electronic equipment manufacturing companies by revenue]]\n* [[Marine electronics]]\n* [[Power electronics]]\n* [[Robotics]]\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* ''The Art of Electronics'' ISBN 978-0-521-37095-0\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikibooks}}\n{{wikibooks |Electrical_engineering}}\n{{wikiversity | School:Electronics}}\n<!--======================== {{No more links}} ============================\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.
