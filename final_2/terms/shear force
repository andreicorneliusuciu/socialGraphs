When the forces are aligned into each other, they are called [[compression forces]]. An example is a deck of cards being pushed one way on the top, and the other at the bottom, causing the cards to slide. Another example is when wind blows at the side of a peaked roof of a home - the side walls experience a force at their top pushing in the direction of the wind, and their bottom in the opposite direction, from the ground or foundation. William A. Nash defines shear force in terms of [[Plane (geometry)|planes]]: \"If a plane is passed through a body, a force acting along this plane is called a ''shear force'' or ''shearing force''.\"<ref name=\"Nash1998\">{{cite book|author=William A.

The factor of 0.6 used to change from [[Tensile force|tensile]] to shear force could vary from 0.58 - 0.62 and will depend on application.\n\nSteel called EN8 bright has a tensile strength of 800 MPa and Mild steel has a tensile strength of 400 MPa.\n\nTo work out the force to shear a 25&nbsp;mm diameter round steel EN8 bright;\n:Area of the 25 mm round steel in mm<sup>2</sup> = (12.5<sup>2</sup>)(\u03c0) = 490.8 mm<sup>2</sup>\n:0.8 kN/mm<sup>2</sup> \u00d7 490.8 mm<sup>2</sup> = 392.64 kN  = 40 ton \u00d7 0.6 (to change force from tensile to shear) = 24 ton\n\nWhen working with a [[bolted joint]], the strength comes from friction between the materials bolted together. Bolts are correctly torqued to maintain the friction. The shear force only becomes relevant when the bolts are not torqued.\n\nA bolt with property class 12.9 has a tensile strength of 1200 MPa (1 MPa = 1 N/mm<sup>2</sup>) or 1.2&nbsp;kN/mm<sup>2</sup> and the yield strength is 0.90 times tensile strength, 1080 MPa in this case.\n\nA bolt with property class 4.6 has a tensile strength of 400 MPa (1 MPa = 1 N/mm<sup>2</sup>) or 0.4&nbsp;kN/mm<sup>2</sup> and yield strength is 0.60 times tensile strength, 240 MPa in this case.\n\nIn case of fastners, proof load is specified as it gives a real life picture about the characteristics of the bolt. \n\n==See also==\n* [[ASTM F568M]], shear force resistance\n*[[Cantilever method]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Force]]\n[[Category:Civil engineering]]"}]}}}}
