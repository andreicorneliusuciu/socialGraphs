The [[Linkage (mechanical)|linkage]] consists of the frame, a [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]], two grounded [[rocker]]s{{dn|date=November 2016}}, and two [[coupler (disambiguation)|couplers]] all connected by [[pivot joints]].  It was developed by Joe Klann in 1994 as an expansion of [[Burmester's theory|Burmester curves]] which are used to develop four-bar double-rocker linkages such as harbor [[Crane (machine)|crane booms]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mechanicalspider.com/enable.html|title=Mechanical Spider|work=Klann Research And Develpment, LLC|accessdate=22 November 2016}}</ref> It is categorized as a modified Stephenson type III [[kinematic chain]].<ref>U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/074,425, was filed on Feb. 11, 1998</ref><ref name=patent6260862>{{US patent|6260862}}</ref><ref>{{US patent|6364040}}</ref><ref>{{US patent|6478314}}</ref>\n\nThe proportions of each of the links in the mechanism are defined to optimize the linearity of the foot for one-half of the rotation of the [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]]. The remaining rotation of the crank allows the foot to be raised to a predetermined height before returning to the starting position and repeating the cycle. Two of these linkages coupled together at the crank and one-half cycle out of phase with each other will allow the frame of a vehicle to travel parallel to the ground.\n\nThe Klann linkage provides many of the benefits of more advanced walking vehicles without some of their limitations. It can step over curbs, climb stairs, or travel into areas that are currently not accessible with wheels but does not require microprocessor control or multitudes of actuator mechanisms. It fits into the technological space between these walking devices and axle-driven wheels.\n\n== Mechanism ==\nKlann linkage work on the basis of [[kinematics]] where all links gives relative motion with each other. It converts the rotatory motion to linear motion, and looks like an animal walking.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2010/02/robotic-spider-melds-legos-and-3-d-printing/|title=Robotic Spider Melds Legos and 3-D Printing|first=Priya|last=Ganapati|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=22 November 2016}}</ref> \n\n[[Image:F1-positions.gif|thumb|center|575px|These figures show a single linkage in the fully extended, mid-stride, retracted, and lifted positions of the walking cycle.

[[Image:F4-motion.gif|thumb|center|575px|This is a repeating animation of the legs in motion with the near legs of each set outlined in blue. A reasonable understanding of the functioning of the linkage can be gained by focusing on a specific point and following it through several cycles. Each of the pivot points is displayed in green. The three positions grounded to the frame for each leg are stationary. The upper and lower rockers move back and forth along a fixed arc and the crank traces out a circle.]]\n\n[[File:Klann-MovementPaths-PatentDrawingBelow.svg|thumb|center|575px|Movement paths of each point]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== Comparison with Jansen's linkage ==\n{{unreferenced|section|date=November 2016}}\n[[File:Strandbeest-Walking-Animation.gif|thumb|Jansen Linkage ]]\nThe Klann mechanism uses six links per leg, whereas the [[Jansen's linkage]] developed by [[Theo Jansen]] uses eight links per leg, with one [[degree of freedom]]. It can walk only on even surfaces and terrain. The number of links in the Jansen mechanism is greater than in the Klann mechanism, and is more costly.\n\nThe Klann linkage can walk on non-planar roads and hill areas, and on uneven surfaces and terrain. The design of the Klann mechanism is portable with less linkage for movement. Friction is required for motion between the legs and surface so it can hold, otherwise it will slip.\n\n== Example leg ==\n[[File:Klann-Table1.svg|thumb|example leg illustrated]]\nIn US Patent 6,260,862 there is a set of coordinates for an example leg:<ref name=patent6260862/>\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!
