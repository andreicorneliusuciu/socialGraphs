For the moment of inertia dealing with the rotation of an object with mass, see [[mass moment of inertia]].''\n\n:''For a list, see [[list of second moments of area]].''\n\nThe '''2nd moment of area''', also known as '''moment of inertia of plane area''', '''area moment of inertia''', or '''second area moment''', is a geometrical property of an area which reflects how its points are distributed with regard to an arbitrary axis. The second moment of area is typically denoted with either an <math>I</math> for an axis that lies in the plane or with a <math>J</math> for an axis perpendicular to the plane. In both cases, it is calculated with a [[multiple integral]] over the object in question. Its [[physical unit|unit]] of dimension is meters to fourth power, [[Unit of length|m]]<sup>4</sup>.\n\nIn the field of [[structural engineering]], the second moment of area of the cross-section of a [[beam (structure)|beam]] is an important property used in the calculation of the beam's [[deflection (engineering)|deflection]] and the calculation of stress caused by a moment applied to the [[beam (structure)|beam]].\n\n: '''''Note:''' Different disciplines use \"Moment of Inertia\" (MOI) to refer to either or both of the '''planar''' second moment of area, <math> I = \\textstyle\\iint_{R} x^2\\, \\mathrm dA </math>, where x is the distance to some reference plane, or the '''polar''' second moment of area, <math> I = \\textstyle\\iint_{R} r^2\\, \\mathrm dA </math>, where r is the distance to some reference axis.  In each case the integral is over all the infinitesimal elements of ''area'', dA, in some two-dimensional cross-section.  In math and physics, \"Moment of Inertia\" is strictly the second moment of '''mass''' with respect to distance from an axis: <math> I = \\textstyle\\int_{Q} r^2 \\mathrm dm </math>, where r is the distance to some potential rotation axis, and the integral is over all the infinitesimal elements of ''mass'', dm, in a three-dimensional space occupied by an object&nbsp;{{mvar|Q}}.  The MOI, in this sense, is the analog of mass for rotational problems. In engineering (especially mechanical and civil), \"Moment of Inertia\" commonly refers to the second moment of the area.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Beer|first1=Ferdinand P.|title=Vector Mechanics for Engineers|date=2013|place=New York|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-339813-6|edition=10th|page=471|quote=The term second moment is more proper than the term moment of inertia, since, logically, the latter should be used only to denote integrals of mass (see Sec. 9.11).

The simplest case relates <math>J_z</math> to <math>I_x</math> and <math>I_y</math>.\n\n: <math>J_z = \\iint\\limits_{R} \\rho^2\\,\\mathrm dA = \\iint\\limits_{R} (x^2 + y^2)\\,\\mathrm dA = \\iint\\limits_{R} x^2\\,\\mathrm dA + \\iint\\limits_{R} y^2\\,\\mathrm dA = I_x + I_y</math>\n\nThis relationship relies on the [[Pythagorean theorem]] which relates <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> to <math>\\rho</math> and on the [[linearity of integration]].\n\n== Composite shapes ==\n\nFor more complex areas, it is often easier to divide the area into a series of \"simpler\" shapes. The second moment of area for the entire shape is the sum of the second moment of areas of all of its parts about a common axis. This can include shapes that are \"missing\" (i.e. holes, hollow shapes, etc.), in which case the second moment of area of the \"missing\" areas are subtracted, rather than added. In other words, the second moment of area of \"missing\" parts are considered negative for the method of composite shapes.\n\n==Examples==\nSee [[list of second moments of area]] for other shapes.\n\n===Rectangle with centroid at the origin===\n[[Image:Moment_of_area_of_a_rectangle_through_the_centroid.svg|thumb|175px|Rectangle with base ''b'' and height ''h''.]]\nConsider a rectangle with base <math>b</math> and height <math>h</math> whose [[centroid]] is located at the origin. <math>I_x</math> represents the second moment of area with respect to the x-axis; <math>I_y</math> represents the second moment of area with respect to the y-axis; <math>J_z</math> represents the polar moment of inertia with respect to the z-axis.\n\n: <math>I_{x} = \\iint\\limits_{R} y^2\\,\\mathrm dA = \\int^{b/2}_{-b/2} \\int^{h/2}_{-h/2} y^2 \\,\\mathrm dy \\,\\mathrm dx = \\int^{b/2}_{-b/2} \\frac{1}{3}\\frac{h^3}{4}\\,\\mathrm dx = \\frac{b h^3}{12}</math>\n\n: <math>I_{y} = \\iint\\limits_{R} x^2\\,\\mathrm dA = \\int^{b/2}_{-b/2} \\int^{h/2}_{-h/2} x^2 \\,\\mathrm dy \\,\\mathrm dx = \\int^{b/2}_{-b/2} h x^2\\,\\mathrm dx = \\frac{b^3 h}{12}</math>\n\nUsing the [[second moment of area#Perpendicular axis theorem|perpendicular axis theorem]] we get the value of <math>J_z</math>.\n\n: <math>J_{z} = I_x + I_y = \\frac{b h^3}{12} + \\frac{h b^3}{12} = \\frac{b h}{12}(b^2 + h^2)</math>\n\n===Annulus centered at origin===\n[[Image:Moment_of_area_of_an_annulus.svg|thumb|175px|Annulus with inner radius ''r<sub>1</sub>'' and outer radius ''r<sub>2</sub>''.]]\n\nConsider an [[annulus (mathematics)|annulus]] whose center is at the origin, outside radius is <math>r_2</math>, and inside radius is <math>r_1</math>. Because of the symmetry of the annulus, the centroid also lies at the origin. We can determine the polar moment of inertia, <math>J_z</math>, about the <math>z</math> axis by the method of composite shapes. This polar moment of inertia is equivalent to the polar moment of inertia of a circle with radius <math>r_2</math> minus the polar moment of inertia of a circle with radius <math>r_1</math>, both centered at the origin.  First, let us derive the polar moment of inertia of a circle with radius <math>r</math> with respect to the origin.  In this case, it is easier to directly calculate <math>J_z</math> as we already have <math>r^2</math>, which has both an <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> component.  Instead of obtaining the second moment of area from [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] as done in the previous section, we shall calculate <math>I_x</math> and <math>J_z</math> directly using [[Polar Coordinates]].\n\n<math>I_{x, circle} = \\iint\\limits_{R} y^2\\,dA = \\iint\\limits_{R} (r\\sin{\\theta)}^2\\,dA = \\int_0^{2\\pi}\\int_0^r (r\\sin{\\theta})^2\\left(r\\,dr\\,d\\theta\\right) = </math>\n:<math> = \\int_0^{2\\pi}\\int_0^r r^3\\sin^2{\\theta}\\,dr\\,d\\theta = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{r^4\\sin^2{\\theta}}{4}\\,d\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{4}r^4</math>\n\n<math>J_{z,circle} = \\iint\\limits_{R} r^2\\,dA = \\int_0^{2\\pi}\\int_0^r r^2\\left(r\\,dr\\,d\\theta\\right) = \\int_0^{2\\pi}\\int_0^r r^3\\,dr\\,d\\theta = </math>\n:<math> = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{r^4}{4}\\,d\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}r^4</math>\n\nNow, the polar moment of inertia about the <math>z</math> axis for an annulus is simply, as stated above, the difference of the second moments of area of a circle with radius <math>r_2</math> and a circle with radius <math>r_1</math>.\n\n<math>J_{z} = J_{z, r_2} - J_{z, r_1} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}r_2^4 - \\frac{\\pi}{2}r_1^4 = \\frac{\\pi}{2}({r_2} ^4 - {r_1} ^4)</math>\n\nAlternatively, we could change the limits on the <math>dr</math> integral the first time around to reflect the fact that there is a hole.  This would be done like this.\n\n<math>J_{z} = \\iint\\limits_{R} r^2\\,dA = \\int_0^{2\\pi}\\int_{r_1}^{r_2} r^2\\left(r\\,dr\\,d\\theta\\right) = \\int_0^{2\\pi}\\int_{r_1}^{r_2} r^3\\,dr\\,d\\theta = </math>\n:<math> = \\int_0^{2\\pi}\\left[\\frac{r_2^4}{4} - \\frac{r_1^4}{4}\\right]\\,d\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\left(r_2^4 - r_1^4\\right)</math>\n\n===Any polygon===\n[[File:Moment of area of a polygon.svg|thumb|175px|A simple polygon.]]\n\nThe second moment of area for any [[simple polygon]] on the XY-plane can be computed in general by summing contributions from each segment of the polygon.\nA polygon is assumed to have <math>n</math> vertices, numbered in counter-clockwise fashion.
