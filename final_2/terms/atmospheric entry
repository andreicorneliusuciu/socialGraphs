There are two main types of atmospheric entry: uncontrolled entry, such as the entry of [[astronomical object]]s, [[space debris]] or [[bolide]]s; and controlled entry (or reentry) of a spacecraft capable of being navigated or following a predetermined course. Technologies and procedures allowing the controlled atmospheric '''e'''ntry, '''d'''escent and '''l'''anding of spacecraft are collectively abbreviated as '''EDL'''.\n\n[[Image:Meteoroid meteor meteorite.gif|Animated illustration of different phases as a meteoroid enters the Earth's atmosphere to become visible as a meteor and land as a meteorite|thumb|right]]\n[[Drag (physics)|Atmospheric drag]] and [[aerodynamic heating]] can cause atmospheric breakup capable of completely disintegrating smaller objects. These forces may cause objects with lower [[compressive strength]] to explode.\n\nFor [[Earth]], atmospheric entry occurs above the [[K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line]] at an [[altitude]] of more than 100&nbsp;km (62&nbsp;mi.) above the surface, while at [[Venus#Atmospheric entry|Venus atmospheric entry]] occurs at 250&nbsp;km (155&nbsp;mi.) and at [[Mars atmospheric entry]] at about 80&nbsp;km (50&nbsp;mi.). Uncontrolled, objects accelerate through the atmosphere at extreme velocities under the influence of Earth's [[gravity]]. Most controlled objects enter at [[hypersonic]] speeds due to their [[Sub-orbital spaceflight|suborbital]] (e.g., [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] reentry vehicles), orbital (e.g., the [[Space Shuttle]]), or [[Hyperbolic trajectory|unbounded]] (e.g., [[meteor]]s) trajectories.   Various advanced technologies have been developed to enable atmospheric reentry and flight at extreme velocities. An alternative low velocity method of controlled atmospheric entry is [[buoyancy]]<ref>http://www.jpaerospace.com/atohandout.pdf</ref> which is suitable for planetary entry where thick atmospheres, strong gravity or both factors complicate high-velocity hyperbolic entry, such as the atmospheres of [[Venus]], [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] and the [[gas giant]]s.<ref>http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.1965-1407</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Apollo cm.jpg|thumb|left|Apollo Command Module flying at a high [[angle of attack]] for lifting entry, artistic rendition.]]\nThe concept of the ablative [[heat shield]] was described as early as 1920 by [[Robert Goddard]]: \"In the case of meteors, which enter the atmosphere with speeds as high as 30 miles per second (48 km/s), the interior of the meteors remains cold, and the erosion is due, to a large extent, to chipping or cracking of the suddenly heated surface.

For early short-range missiles, like the [[V-2 rocket|V-2]], stabilization and aerodynamic stress were important issues (many V-2s broke apart during reentry), but heating was not a serious problem. Medium-range missiles like the Soviet [[R-5 Pobeda|R-5]], with a 1200&nbsp;km range, required ceramic composite heat shielding on separable reentry vehicles (it was no longer possible for the entire rocket structure to survive reentry). The first [[ICBM]]s, with ranges of 8000 to 12,000&nbsp;km, were only possible with the development of modern ablative heat shields and blunt-shaped vehicles.  In the USA, this technology was pioneered by [[H. Julian Allen]] at [[Ames Research Center]].<ref>Boris Chertok, \"Rockets and People\", NASA History Series, 2006</ref>\n\n==Terminology, definitions and jargon==\nOver the decades since the 1950s, a rich technical jargon has grown around the engineering of vehicles designed to enter planetary atmospheres.  It is recommended that the reader review the [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Glossary_of_atmospheric_reentry jargon glossary] before continuing with this article on atmospheric reentry.\n\nWhen atmospheric entry is part of a spacecraft landing or recovery, particularly on a planetary body other than Earth, entry is part of a phase referred to as \"entry, descent and landing\", or EDL.<ref>http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/501326main_TA09-EDL-DRAFT-Nov2010-A.pdf</ref>\nWhen the atmospheric entry returns to the same body that the vehicle had launched from, the event is referred to as '''reentry''' (almost always referring to Earth entry).\n\n==Blunt body entry vehicles==\n\n[[Image:Blunt body reentry shapes.png|thumb|Various reentry shapes (NASA) using [[Schlieren photography|shadowgraph]]s to show high-velocity flow]]\nThese four [[Schlieren photography|shadowgraph]] images represent early reentry-vehicle concepts. A shadowgraph is a process that makes visible the disturbances that occur in a fluid flow at high velocity, in which light passing through a flowing fluid is refracted by the [[Density Gradient|density gradients]] in the fluid resulting in bright and dark areas on a screen placed behind the fluid.\n\nIn the United States, [[H. Julian Allen]] and [[Alfred J. Eggers|A. J. Eggers, Jr.]] of the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA) made the counterintuitive discovery in 1951<ref>{{cite book |url=http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4305/sp4305.htm |last=Hansen |first=James R. |date=Jun 1987 |title=Engineer in Charge: A History of the Langley Aeronautical Laboratory, 1917-1958 |series=The NASA History Series |volume=sp-4305 |chapter=Chapter 12: Hypersonics and the Transition to Space |chapterurl=http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4305/ch12.htm\n|publisher=United States Government Printing |isbn=978-0-318-23455-7}}</ref> that a blunt shape (high drag) made the most effective heat shield. From simple engineering principles, Allen and Eggers showed that the heat load experienced by an entry vehicle was inversely proportional to the [[drag coefficient]], i.e. the greater the drag, the less the heat load. If the reentry vehicle is made blunt, air cannot \"get out of the way\" quickly enough, and acts as an air cushion to push the shock wave and heated shock layer forward (away from the vehicle).  Since most of the hot gases are no longer in direct contact with the vehicle, the heat energy would stay in the shocked gas and simply move around the vehicle to later dissipate into the atmosphere.\n\nThe Allen and Eggers discovery, though initially treated as a military secret, was eventually published in 1958.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk/reports/1958/naca-report-1381.pdf |last1=Allen |first1=H.

The aerodynamics of a sphere or spherical section are easy to model analytically using Newtonian impact theory.  Likewise, the spherical section's heat flux can be accurately modeled with the Fay-Riddell equation.<ref name=\"Fay-Riddell\">{{cite journal|last1=Fay |first1=J. A. |last2=Riddell |first2=F.

Pure spheres have no lift.  However, by flying at an [[angle of attack]], a spherical section has modest aerodynamic lift thus providing some cross-range capability and widening its entry corridor.  In the late 1950s and early 1960s, high-speed computers were not yet available and [[computational fluid dynamics]] was still embryonic.  Because the spherical section was amenable to closed-form analysis, that geometry became the default for conservative design. Consequently, manned capsules of that era were based upon the spherical section.\n\nPure spherical entry vehicles were used in the early Soviet [[Vostok programme|Vostok]] and [[Voskhod programme|Voskhod]] and in Soviet Mars and [[Venera]] descent vehicles.  The  [[Apollo Command/Service Module]] used a spherical section forebody heat shield with a converging conical afterbody.  It flew a lifting entry with a hypersonic trim angle of attack of \u221227\u00b0 (0\u00b0 is blunt-end first) to yield an average L/D (lift-to-drag ratio) of 0.368.<ref>[http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19690029435_1969029435.pdf Hillje, Ernest R., \"Entry Aerodynamics at Lunar Return Conditions Obtained from the Flight of Apollo 4 (AS-501),\" NASA TN D-5399, (1969).]</ref>  This angle of attack was achieved by precisely offsetting the vehicle's center of mass from its axis of symmetry.  Other examples of the spherical section geometry in manned capsules are [[Soyuz programme|Soyuz]]/[[Zond program|Zond]], [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] and [[Project Mercury|Mercury]]. Even these small amounts of lift allow trajectories that have very significant effects on peak g-force (reducing g-force from 8-9g for a purely ballistic (slowed only by drag) trajectory to 4-5g) as well as greatly reducing the peak reentry heat.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Whittington|first1=Kurt Thomas|title=A Tool to Extrapolate Thermal Reentry Atmosphere Parameters Along a Body in Trajectory Space|url=http://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/ir/bitstream/1840.16/6817/1/etd.pdf|website=NCSU Libraries Technical Reports Repository|publisher=A thesis submitted to the Graduate Faculty of North Carolina State University in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science Aerospace Engineering Raleigh, North Carolina 2011, pp.5|accessdate=5 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Sphere-cone===\nThe sphere-cone is a spherical section with a [[frustum]] or blunted cone attached.  The sphere-cone's dynamic stability is typically better than that of a spherical section. The vehicle enters cone-first. With a sufficiently small half-angle and properly placed center of mass, a sphere-cone can provide aerodynamic stability from Keplerian entry to surface impact.  (The \"half-angle\" is the angle between the cone's axis of rotational symmetry and its outer surface, and thus half the angle made by the cone's surface edges.)\n[[Image:Mk 2.jpg|thumb|left|Prototype of the Mk-2 Reentry Vehicle (RV), based on blunt body theory]]\n\nThe original American sphere-cone aeroshell was the Mk-2 RV (reentry vehicle), which was developed in 1955 by the [[General Electric|General Electric Corp.]]  The Mk-2's design was derived from blunt-body theory and used a radiatively cooled thermal protection system (TPS) based upon a metallic heat shield (the different TPS types are later described in this article).  The Mk-2 had significant defects as a weapon delivery system, i.e., it loitered too long in the upper atmosphere due to its lower [[ballistic coefficient]] and also trailed a stream of vaporized metal making it very visible to [[radar]].  These defects made the Mk-2 overly susceptible to anti-ballistic missile (ABM) systems.  Consequently, an alternative sphere-cone RV to the Mk-2 was developed by General Electric.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}  [[Image:Mk 6 reentry vehicle on display at National Atomic Museum.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Mk-6 RV, Cold War weapon and ancestor to most of the U.S. missile entry vehicles]]This new RV was the Mk-6 which used a non-metallic ablative TPS (nylon phenolic).  This new TPS was so effective as a reentry heat shield that significantly reduced bluntness was possible.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}  However, the Mk-6 was a huge RV with an entry mass of 3360&nbsp;kg, a length of 3.1 meters and a half-angle of 12.5\u00b0.  Subsequent advances in nuclear weapon and ablative TPS design allowed RVs to become significantly smaller with a further reduced bluntness ratio compared to the Mk-6.  Since the 1960s, the sphere-cone has become the preferred geometry for modern ICBM RVs with typical half-angles being between 10\u00b0 to 11\u00b0.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n[[Image:Rv film pod.jpg|thumb|upright|\"Discoverer\" type reconnaissance satellite film Recovery Vehicle (RV)]]\n\n[[Reconnaissance satellite]] RVs (recovery vehicles) also used a sphere-cone shape and were the first American example of a non-munition entry vehicle ([[Corona (satellite)|Discoverer-I]], launched on 28 February 1959).  The sphere-cone was later used for space exploration missions to other celestial bodies or for return from open space; e.g., [[Stardust probe]].  Unlike with military RVs, the advantage of the blunt body's lower TPS mass remained with space exploration entry vehicles like the [[Galileo Probe]] with a half angle of 45\u00b0 or the [[Viking program|Viking aeroshell]] with a half angle of 70\u00b0. Space exploration sphere-cone entry vehicles have landed on the surface or entered the atmospheres of [[Mars]], [[Venus]], [[Jupiter]] and [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].\n[[Image:Galileo probe.jpg|thumb|[[Galileo Probe]] during final assembly]]\n\n===Biconic===\nThe [[biconic]] is a sphere-cone with an additional frustum attached.  The biconic offers a significantly improved L/D ratio.  A biconic designed for Mars aerocapture typically has an L/D of approximately 1.0 compared to an L/D of 0.368 for the Apollo-CM.  The higher L/D makes a biconic shape better suited for transporting people to Mars due to the lower peak deceleration.  Arguably, the most significant biconic ever flown was the ''Advanced [[Maneuverable reentry vehicle|Maneuverable Reentry Vehicle]]'' (AMaRV).  Four AMaRVs were made by the [[McDonnell Douglas|McDonnell-Douglas Corp.]] and represented a significant leap in RV sophistication.  Three AMaRVs were launched by [[LGM-30 Minuteman|Minuteman-1 ICBMs]] on 20 December 1979, 8 October 1980 and 4 October 1981.  AMaRV had an entry mass of approximately 470&nbsp;kg, a nose radius of 2.34&nbsp;cm, a forward frustum half-angle of 10.4\u00b0, an inter-frustum radius of 14.6&nbsp;cm, aft frustum half angle of 6\u00b0, and an axial length of 2.079 meters.  No accurate diagram or picture of AMaRV has ever appeared in the open literature.  However, a schematic sketch of an AMaRV-like vehicle along with trajectory plots showing hairpin turns has been published.<ref>Regan, Frank J. and Anadakrishnan, Satya M., \"Dynamics of Atmospheric Re-Entry,\" AIAA Education Series, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc., New York, ISBN 1-56347-048-9, (1993).<!-- I think this refers to diagrams of simulations on pg. 268 & 269.

[[Hydraulic machinery|Hydraulic actuation]] was used for controlling the flaps.  AMaRV was guided by a fully autonomous navigation system designed for evading [[anti-ballistic missile]] (ABM) interception.  The [[McDonnell Douglas DC-X]] (also a biconic) was essentially a scaled-up version of AMaRV.  AMaRV and the DC-X also served as the basis for an unsuccessful proposal for what eventually became the [[Lockheed Martin X-33]].\n\n===Non-axisymmetric shapes===\nNon-axisymmetric shapes have been used for manned entry vehicles.  One example is the winged orbit vehicle that uses a [[delta wing]] for maneuvering during descent much like a conventional glider. This approach has been used by the American [[Space Shuttle]] and the Soviet [[Shuttle Buran|Buran]]. The [[lifting body]] is another entry vehicle geometry and was used with the [[X-23 PRIME]] (Precision Recovery Including Maneuvering Entry) vehicle. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe FIRST (Fabrication of Inflatable Re-entry Structures for Test) system was an [[Aerojet]] proposal for an inflated-spar [[Rogallo wing]] made up from [[Inconel]] wire cloth impregnated with silicone rubber and silicon carbide dust. FIRST was proposed in both one-man and six man versions, used for emergency escape and reentry of stranded space station crews, and was based on an earlier unmanned test program that resulted in a partially successful reentry flight from space (the launcher nose cone fairing hung up on the material, dragging it too low and fast for the thermal  protection system (TPS), but otherwise it appears the concept would have worked; even with the fairing dragging it, the test article flew stably on reentry until burn-through). {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe proposed [[MOOSE]] system would have used a one-man inflatable ballistic capsule as an emergency astronaut entry vehicle. This concept was carried further by the Douglas [[Paracone]] project. While these concepts were unusual, the inflated shape on reentry was in fact axisymmetric. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n==Shock layer gas physics==\nAt typical reentry temperatures, the air in the shock layer is both [[ionized]] and [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociated]].{{fact | date=September 2016}} This chemical dissociation necessitates various physical models to describe the shock layer's thermal and chemical properties.  There are four basic physical models of a gas that are important to aeronautical engineers who design heat shields:\n\n===Perfect gas model===\nAlmost all aeronautical engineers are taught the [[Ideal gas|perfect (ideal) gas model]] during their undergraduate education.  Most of the important perfect gas equations along with their corresponding tables and graphs are shown in NACA Report 1135.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Equations, tables, and charts for compressible flow |publisher=NASA Technical Reports |issue=NACA-TR-1135 |year=1953 |url=http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/734673main_Equations-Tables-Charts-CompressibleFlow-Report-1135.pdf |journal=NACA Annual Report |volume=39 |pages=613\u2013681}}</ref>  Excerpts from NACA Report 1135 often appear in the appendices of thermodynamics textbooks and are familiar to most aeronautical engineers who design supersonic aircraft.\n\nThe perfect gas theory is elegant and extremely useful for designing aircraft but assumes that the gas is chemically inert.  From the standpoint of aircraft design, air can be assumed to be inert for temperatures less than 550 K at one atmosphere pressure.  The perfect gas theory begins to break down at 550 K and is not usable at temperatures greater than 2,000 K.  For temperatures greater than 2,000 K, a heat shield designer must use a ''real gas model''.\n\n===Real (equilibrium) gas model===\nAn entry vehicle's pitching moment can be significantly influenced by real-gas effects. Both the Apollo-CM and the Space Shuttle were designed using incorrect pitching moments determined through inaccurate real-gas modelling. The Apollo-CM's trim-angle angle of attack was higher than originally estimated, resulting in a narrower lunar return entry corridor.  The actual aerodynamic centre of the [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] was upstream from the calculated value due to real-gas effects.  On ''Columbia''\u2019s maiden flight ([[STS-1]]), astronauts [[John Young (astronaut)|John W. Young]] and [[Robert Crippen]] had some anxious moments during reentry when there was concern about losing control of the vehicle.<ref>Kenneth Iliff and Mary Shafer, ''Space Shuttle Hypersonic Aerodynamic and Aerothermodynamic Flight Research and the Comparison to Ground Test Results'', Page 5-6</ref>\n\nAn equilibrium real-gas model assumes that a gas is chemically reactive, but also assumes all chemical reactions have had time to complete and all components of the gas have the same temperature (this is called ''[[thermodynamic equilibrium]]'').  When air is processed by a shock wave, it is superheated by compression and chemically dissociates through many different reactions.  Direct friction upon the reentry object is not the main cause of shock-layer heating. It is caused mainly from [[isentropic process|isentropic]] heating of the air molecules within the compression wave.  Friction based entropy increases of the molecules within the wave also account for some heating.{{or|date=November 2013}}  The distance from the shock wave to the [[stagnation point]] on the entry vehicle's leading edge is called ''shock wave stand off''.  An approximate rule of thumb for shock wave standoff distance is 0.14 times the nose radius. One can estimate the time of travel for a gas molecule from the shock wave to the stagnation point by assuming a free stream velocity of 7.8&nbsp;km/s and a nose radius of 1 meter, i.e., time of travel is about 18 microseconds.  This is roughly the time required for shock-wave-initiated chemical dissociation to approach [[chemical equilibrium]] in a shock layer for a 7.8&nbsp;km/s entry into air during peak heat flux.  Consequently, as air approaches the entry vehicle's stagnation point, the air effectively reaches chemical equilibrium thus enabling an equilibrium model to be usable. For this case, most of the shock layer between the shock wave and leading edge of an entry vehicle is chemically reacting and ''not'' in a state of equilibrium. The [[wikt:Appendix:Glossary of atmospheric reentry#F|Fay-Riddell equation]],<ref name=\"Fay-Riddell\"/> which is of extreme importance towards modeling heat flux, owes its validity to the stagnation point being in chemical equilibrium.  The time required for the shock layer gas to reach equilibrium is strongly dependent upon the shock layer's pressure.  For example, in the case of the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo Probe]]'s entry into Jupiter's atmosphere, the shock layer was mostly in equilibrium during peak heat flux due to the very high pressures experienced (this is counterintuitive given the free stream velocity was 39&nbsp;km/s during peak heat flux).\n\nDetermining the thermodynamic state of the stagnation point is more difficult under an equilibrium gas model than a perfect gas model.  Under a perfect gas model, the ''ratio of specific heats'' (also called \"isentropic exponent\", [[adiabatic index]], \"gamma\" or \"kappa\") is assumed to be constant along with the [[gas constant]].  For a real gas, the ratio of specific heats can wildly oscillate as a function of temperature.  Under a perfect gas model there is an elegant set of equations for determining thermodynamic state along a constant entropy stream line called the ''isentropic chain''.  For a real gas, the isentropic chain is unusable and a ''Mollier diagram'' would be used instead for manual calculation.  However, graphical solution with a Mollier diagram is now considered obsolete with modern heat shield designers using computer programs based upon a digital lookup table (another form of Mollier diagram) or a chemistry based thermodynamics program.  The chemical composition of a gas in equilibrium with fixed pressure and temperature can be determined through the ''Gibbs free energy method''.  [[Gibbs free energy]] is simply the total [[enthalpy]] of the gas minus its total [[entropy]] times temperature.  A chemical equilibrium program normally does not require chemical formulas or reaction-rate equations.  The program works by preserving the original elemental abundances specified for the gas and varying the different molecular combinations of the elements through numerical iteration until the lowest possible Gibbs free energy is calculated (a [[Newton's method|Newton-Raphson method]] is the usual numerical scheme).  The data base for a Gibbs free energy program comes from spectroscopic data used in defining [[Partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition functions]].  Among the best equilibrium codes in existence is the program ''Chemical Equilibrium with Applications'' (CEA) which was written by Bonnie J. McBride and Sanford Gordon at NASA Lewis (now renamed \"NASA Glenn Research Center\").  Other names for CEA are the \"Gordon and McBride Code\" and the \"Lewis Code\". CEA is quite accurate up to 10,000 K for planetary atmospheric gases, but unusable beyond 20,000 K ([[double ionization]] is not modelled).  [http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/CEAWeb/ CEA can be downloaded from the Internet] along with full documentation and will compile on Linux under the [[GNU Fortran|G77 Fortran]] compiler.\n\n===Real (non-equilibrium) gas model===\nA non-equilibrium real gas model is the most accurate model of a shock layer's gas physics, but is more difficult to solve than an equilibrium model.  The simplest non-equilibrium model is the ''Lighthill-Freeman model''.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lighthill |first=M.J. |title=Dynamics of a Dissociating Gas. Part I.

Because of its simplicity, the Lighthill-Freeman model is a useful pedagogical tool, but is unfortunately too simple for modelling non-equilibrium air.  Air is typically assumed to have a mole fraction composition of 0.7812 molecular nitrogen, 0.2095 molecular oxygen and 0.0093 argon.  The simplest real gas model for air is the ''five species model'', which is based upon N<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, NO, N, and O. The five species model assumes no ionization and ignores trace species like carbon dioxide.\n\nWhen running a Gibbs free energy equilibrium program, the iterative process from the originally specified molecular composition to the final calculated equilibrium composition is essentially random and not time accurate.  With a non-equilibrium program, the computation process is time accurate and follows a solution path dictated by chemical and reaction rate formulas.  The five species model has 17 chemical formulas (34 when counting reverse formulas).  The Lighthill-Freeman model is based upon a single ordinary differential equation and one algebraic equation.  The five species model is based upon 5 ordinary differential equations and 17 algebraic equations.  Because the 5 ordinary differential equations are loosely coupled, the system is numerically \"stiff\" and difficult to solve. The five species model is only usable for entry from [[low Earth orbit]] where entry velocity is approximately 7.8&nbsp;km/s.  For lunar return entry of 11&nbsp;km/s, the shock layer contains a significant amount of ionized nitrogen and oxygen.  The five species model is no longer accurate and a twelve species model must be used instead.  High speed Mars entry which involves a carbon dioxide, nitrogen and argon atmosphere is even more complex requiring a 19 species model.\n\nAn important aspect of modelling non-equilibrium real gas effects is radiative heat flux.  If a vehicle is entering an atmosphere at very high speed (hyperbolic trajectory, lunar return) and has a large nose radius then radiative heat flux can dominate TPS heating.  Radiative heat flux during entry into an air or carbon dioxide atmosphere typically comes from asymmetric diatomic molecules; e.g., [[cyanogen]] (CN), [[carbon monoxide]], [[nitric oxide]] (NO), single ionized molecular nitrogen etc.  These molecules are formed by the shock wave dissociating ambient atmospheric gas followed by recombination within the shock layer into new molecular species.  The newly formed [[diatomic]] molecules initially have a very high vibrational temperature that efficiently transforms the [[quantum vibration|vibrational energy]] into radiant energy; i.e., radiative heat flux.  The whole process takes place in less than a millisecond which makes modelling a challenge.  The experimental measurement of radiative heat flux (typically done with shock tubes) along with theoretical calculation through the unsteady [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] are among the more esoteric aspects of aerospace engineering.  Most of the aerospace research work related to understanding radiative heat flux was done in the 1960s, but largely discontinued after conclusion of the Apollo Program.  Radiative heat flux in air was just sufficiently understood to ensure Apollo's success.  However, radiative heat flux in carbon dioxide (Mars entry) is still barely understood and will require major research.\n\n===Frozen gas model===\nThe frozen gas model describes a special case of a gas that is not in equilibrium.  The name \"frozen gas\" can be misleading.  A frozen gas is not \"frozen\" like ice is frozen water.  Rather a frozen gas is \"frozen\" in time (all chemical reactions are assumed to have stopped).  Chemical reactions are normally driven by collisions between molecules.  If gas pressure is slowly reduced such that chemical reactions can continue then the gas can remain in equilibrium.  However, it is possible for gas pressure to be so suddenly reduced that almost all chemical reactions stop.  For that situation the gas is considered frozen.\n\nThe distinction between equilibrium and frozen is important because it is possible for a gas such as air to have significantly different properties (speed-of-sound, [[viscosity]] etc.) for the same thermodynamic state; e.g., pressure and temperature.  Frozen gas can be a significant issue in the wake behind an entry vehicle.  During reentry, free stream air is compressed to high temperature and pressure by the entry vehicle's shock wave.  Non-equilibrium air in the shock layer is then transported past the entry vehicle's leading side into a region of rapidly expanding flow that causes freezing.  The frozen air can then be entrained into a trailing vortex behind the entry vehicle.  Correctly modelling the flow in the wake of an entry vehicle is very difficult.  [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|Thermal protection shield]] (TPS) heating in the vehicle's afterbody is usually not very high, but the geometry and unsteadiness of the vehicle's wake can significantly influence aerodynamics (pitching moment) and particularly dynamic stability.\n\n==Thermal protection systems==\nA '''thermal protection system''' or TPS is the barrier that protects a [[spacecraft]] during the searing heat of atmospheric reentry.  A secondary goal may be to protect the spacecraft from the [[Solar constant|heat]] [[Radiative heat transfer|and]] [[Outer space#Environment|cold]] of space while in orbit.  Multiple approaches for the thermal protection of spacecraft are in use, among them ablative heat shields, passive cooling and active cooling of spacecraft surfaces.\n\n===Ablative===\n[[File:Apollo 12 heat shield.JPG|thumb|left|Ablative heat shield (after use) on [[Apollo 12]] capsule]]\nThe [[Ablation|ablative]] heat shield functions by lifting the hot shock layer gas away from the heat shield's outer wall (creating a cooler [[boundary layer]]). The boundary layer comes from ''blowing'' of gaseous reaction products from the heat shield material and provides protection against all forms of heat flux.  The overall process of reducing the heat flux experienced by the heat shield's outer wall by way of a boundary layer is called ''blockage''.  Ablation occurs at two levels in an ablative TPS: the outer surface of the TPS material chars, melts, and [[Sublimation (physics)|sublimes]], while the bulk of the TPS material undergoes [[pyrolysis]] and expels product gases.  The gas produced by pyrolysis is what drives blowing and causes blockage of convective and catalytic heat flux.  [[Pyrolysis]] can be measured in real time using [[thermogravimetric analysis]], so that the ablative performance can be evaluated.<ref>Parker, John and C. Michael Hogan, \"Techniques for Wind Tunnel assessment of Ablative Materials,\" NASA Ames Research Center, Technical Publication, August, 1965.</ref>  Ablation can also provide blockage against radiative heat flux by introducing carbon into the shock layer thus making it optically opaque.  Radiative heat flux blockage was the primary thermal protection mechanism of the Galileo Probe TPS material (carbon phenolic).  Carbon phenolic was originally developed as a rocket nozzle throat material (used in the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster]]) and for re-entry vehicle nose tips.\n\nEarly research on ablation technology in the USA was centered at [[NASA]]'s [[Ames Research Center]] located at [[Moffett Field]], California.   [[Ames Research Center]] was ideal, since it had numerous [[wind tunnels]] capable of generating varying wind velocities.  Initial experiments typically mounted a mock-up of the ablative material to be analyzed within a [[hypersonic]] wind tunnel.<ref>Hogan, C. Michael, Parker, John and Winkler, Ernest, of [[NASA]] Ames Research Center,  \"An Analytical Method for Obtaining the Thermogravimetric Kinetics of Char-forming Ablative Materials from Thermogravimetric Measurements\", AIAA/ASME Seventh Structures and Materials Conference, April, 1966</ref> Testing of ablative materials occurs at the Ames Arc Jet Complex.  Many spacecraft thermal protection systems have been tested in this facility, including the Apollo, space shuttle, and Orion heat shield materials.<ref>{{Cite web|title = NASA - Arc Jet Complex|url = http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/research/technology-onepagers/arcjetcomplex.html|website = www.nasa.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-05}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Mars Pathfinder.jpg|thumb|upright|Mars Pathfinder during final assembly showing the aeroshell, cruise ring and solid rocket motor]]\nThe [[thermal conductivity]] of a particular TPS material is usually proportional to the material's density.<ref name=\"Di Benedetto\">{{cite book|last1=Di Benedetto|first1=A.T.|last2=Nicolais|first2=L.|last3=Watanabe|first3=R.|title=Composite materials : proceedings of Symposium A4 on Composite Materials of the International Conference on Advanced Materials--ICAM 91, Strasbourg, France, 27-29 May, 1991|date=1992|publisher=North-Holland|location=Amsterdam|isbn=0444893563|page=111}}</ref> Carbon phenolic is a very effective ablative material, but also has high density which is undesirable.  If the heat flux experienced by an entry vehicle is insufficient to cause pyrolysis then the TPS material's conductivity could allow heat flux conduction into the TPS bondline material thus leading to TPS failure.  Consequently, for entry trajectories causing lower heat flux, carbon phenolic is sometimes inappropriate and lower density TPS materials such as the following examples can be better design choices:\n\n====SLA-561V====\n''SLA'' in ''SLA-561V'' stands for ''super light-weight ablator''. SLA-561V is a proprietary ablative made by [[Lockheed Martin]] that has been used as the primary TPS material on all of the 70\u00b0 sphere-cone entry vehicles sent by NASA to Mars other than the [[Mars Science Laboratory]] (MSL). SLA-561V begins significant ablation at a heat flux of approximately 110&nbsp;W/cm\u00b2, but will fail for heat fluxes greater than 300&nbsp;W/cm\u00b2. The MSL aeroshell TPS is currently designed to withstand a peak heat flux of 234&nbsp;W/cm\u00b2. The peak heat flux experienced by the [[Viking 1|Viking-1]] aeroshell which landed on Mars was 21&nbsp;W/cm\u00b2.  For Viking-1, the TPS acted as a charred thermal insulator and never experienced significant ablation.  Viking-1 was the first Mars lander and based upon a very conservative design. The Viking aeroshell had a base diameter of 3.54&nbsp;meters (the largest used on Mars until Mars Science Laboratory).  SLA-561V is applied by packing the ablative material into a honeycomb core that is pre-bonded to the aeroshell's structure thus enabling construction of a large heat shield.<ref>\n{{cite techreport\n| first=Huy\n| last=Tran\n| author2=Michael Tauber |author3=William Henline |author4=Duoc Tran |author5=Alan Cartledge |author6=Frank Hui |author7=Norm Zimmerman\n| title=Ames Research Center Shear Tests of SLA-561V Heat Shield Material for Mars-Pathfinder\n| number=NASA Technical Memorandum 110402\n| institution=NASA Ames Research Center\n| year=1996\n| url=http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19960049758_1996080506.pdf\n}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Stardust Capsule on Ground.jpg|thumb|left|upright|NASA's Stardust sample return capsule successfully landed at the USAF Utah Range.]]\n\n====Phenolic impregnated carbon ablator====\n''Phenolic impregnated carbon ablator'' (PICA), a [[carbon fiber]] preform impregnated in [[phenolic resin]],<ref>{{cite conference |url=http://www.jeanlachaud.com/research/Lachaud2010_AbstractOFWS5.pdf |first=Jean |last=Lachaud |first2=Nagi |last2=N.

Since SIRCA can be machined to precise shapes, it can be applied as tiles, leading edge sections, full nose caps, or in any number of custom shapes or sizes.  {{as of|1996}}, SIRCA had been demonstrated in backshell interface applications, but not yet as a forebody TPS material.<ref>Tran, Huy K., et al., \"Silicone impregnated reusable ceramic ablators for Mars follow-on missions,\" AIAA-1996-1819, Thermophysics Conference, 31st, New Orleans, LA, June 17\u201320, 1996.</ref>\n\n====AVCOAT====\n[[AVCOAT 5026-39|AVCOAT]] is a [[NASA]]-specified ablative heat shield, a glass-filled [[epoxy]]-[[novolac]] system.<ref name=nasa196808>\n[http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19680021275_1968021275.pdf Flight-Test Analysis Of Apollo Heat-Shield Material Using The Pacemaker Vehicle System] [[NASA]] Technical Note D-4713, pp. 8, 1968-08, accessed 2010-12-26.

W. Thomas]] takes a close look at TPS tiles underneath [[Space Shuttle Atlantis]].]]\n[[File:Silica Space Shuttle thermal protection (TPS) tile, c 1980. (9663807484).jpg|thumb|right|Rigid black [[LI-900]] tiles were used on the [[Space Shuttle]].]]\nThermal soak is a part of almost all TPS schemes.  For example, an ablative heat shield loses most of its thermal protection effectiveness when the outer wall temperature drops below the minimum necessary for pyrolysis.  From that time to the end of the heat pulse, heat from the shock layer convects into the heat shield's outer wall and would eventually conduct to the payload.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} This outcome is prevented by ejecting the heat shield (with its heat soak) prior to the heat conducting to the inner wall.\n\nTypical [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|Space Shuttle TPS]] tiles ([[LI-900]]) have remarkable thermal protection properties. An LI-900 tile exposed to a temperature of 1000 K on one side will remain merely warm to the touch on the other side. However, they are relatively brittle and break easily, and cannot survive in-flight rain.\n\n===Passively-cooled===\nIn some early ballistic missile RVs (e.g., the Mk-2 and the [[sub-orbital spaceflight|suborbital]] [[Project Mercury|Mercury spacecraft]]), ''radiatively-cooled TPS'' were used to initially absorb heat flux during the heat pulse, and, then, after the heat pulse, radiate and convect the stored heat back into the atmosphere.  However, the earlier version of this technique required a considerable quantity of metal TPS (e.g., [[titanium]], [[beryllium]], [[copper]], etc.).  Modern designers prefer to avoid this added mass by using ablative and thermal-soak TPS instead.  [[Image:Mercury Capsule2.png|thumb|upright|left|The Mercury capsule design (shown here with its [[Launch escape system|escape tower]]) originally used a radiatively-cooled TPS, but was later converted to an ablative TPS.]]\n\nRadiatively-cooled TPS can still be found on modern entry vehicles, but [[reinforced carbon-carbon]] (RCC) (also called ''carbon-carbon'') is normally used instead of metal.  RCC was the TPS material on the Space Shuttle's nose cone and wing leading edges, and was also proposed as the leading-edge material for the [[X-33]].  [[Carbon]] is the most refractory material known, with a one-atmosphere sublimation temperature of 3825&nbsp;\u00b0C for graphite.  This high temperature made carbon an obvious choice as a radiatively cooled TPS material.  Disadvantages of RCC are that it is currently expensive to manufacture, is heavy, and lacks robust impact resistance.<ref>[http://history.nasa.gov/columbia/CAIB_reportindex.html] Columbia Accident Investigation Board report.</ref>\n\nSome high-velocity [[aircraft]], such as the [[SR-71 Blackbird]] and [[Concorde]], deal with heating similar to that experienced by spacecraft, but at much lower intensity, and for hours at a time.  Studies of the SR-71's titanium skin revealed that the metal structure was restored to its original strength through [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] due to aerodynamic heating.  In the case of the Concorde, the [[aluminium]] nose was permitted to reach a maximum [[operating temperature]] of 127&nbsp;\u00b0C (approximately 180&nbsp;\u00b0C warmer than the, normally sub-zero, ambient air); the metallurgical implications (loss of [[tempering (metallurgy)|temper]]) that would be associated with a higher peak temperature were the most significant factors determining the top speed of the aircraft.\n\nA radiatively-cooled TPS for an entry vehicle is often called a ''hot-metal TPS''.  Early TPS designs for the Space Shuttle called for a hot-metal TPS based upon a nickel [[superalloy]] (dubbed [[Ren\u00e9 41]]) and titanium shingles.<ref>[http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/shuttle.htm] Shuttle Evolutionary History.</ref>  This Shuttle TPS concept was rejected, because it was believed a silica-tile-based TPS would involve lower development and manufacturing costs.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  A nickel [[superalloy]]-shingle TPS was again proposed for the unsuccessful [[X-33]] single-stage-to-orbit ([[SSTO]]) prototype.<ref>[http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20040095922_2004100223.pdf] X-33 Heat Shield Development report.</ref>\n\nRecently, newer radiatively-cooled TPS materials have been developed that could be superior to RCC.  Known as Ultra-High Temperature Ceramics, they were developed for the prototype vehicle Slender Hypervelocity Aerothermodynamic Research Probe (SHARP). These TPS materials are based on [[zirconium diboride]] and [[hafnium diboride]].  SHARP TPS have suggested performance improvements allowing for sustained Mach 7 flight at sea level, Mach 11 flight at {{convert|100000|ft|m|abbr=on}} altitudes, and significant improvements for vehicles designed for continuous hypersonic flight.  SHARP TPS materials enable sharp leading edges and nose cones to greatly reduce drag for airbreathing combined-cycle-propelled spaceplanes and lifting bodies.  SHARP materials have exhibited effective TPS characteristics from zero to more than 2,000&nbsp;\u00b0C, with melting points over 3,500&nbsp;\u00b0C.  They are structurally stronger than RCC, and, thus, do not require structural reinforcement with materials such as Inconel.  SHARP materials are extremely efficient at reradiating absorbed heat, thus eliminating the need for additional TPS behind and between the SHARP materials and conventional vehicle structure.  NASA initially funded (and discontinued) a multi-phase R&D program through the [[University of Montana]] in 2001 to test SHARP materials on test vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hubbard.engr.scu.edu/docs/thesis/2003/SHARP_Thesis.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215231157/http://hubbard.engr.scu.edu:80/docs/thesis/2003/SHARP_Thesis.pdf |archivedate=2005-12-15 |df= }}</ref><ref>[http://www.coe.montana.edu/me/faculty/cairns/sharp/sharp.htm sharp structure homepage w left<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016071845/http://www.coe.montana.edu/me/faculty/cairns/sharp/sharp.htm |date=October 16, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n===Actively cooled===\nVarious advanced reusable spacecraft and hypersonic aircraft designs have been proposed to employ heat shields made from temperature-resistant metal [[alloy]]s that incorporated a refrigerant or cryogenic fuel circulating through them.  Such a TPS concept was proposed for the [[Rockwell X-30|X-30 National Aerospace Plane]] (NASP).  The NASP was supposed to have been a [[scramjet]] powered hypersonic aircraft, but failed in development.\n\nIn the early 1960s various TPS systems were proposed to use water or other cooling liquid sprayed into the shock layer, or passed through channels in the heat shield. Advantages included the possibility of more all-metal designs which would be cheaper to develop, be more rugged, and eliminate the need for classified technology. The disadvantages are increased weight and complexity, and lower reliability. The concept has never been flown, but a similar technology (the plug nozzle<ref>[http://www.astronautix.com/engines/j2.htm - J2T-200K & J2T-250K]</ref>) did undergo extensive ground testing.\n\n==Feathered reentry==\nIn 2004, aircraft designer [[Burt Rutan]] demonstrated the feasibility of a shape-changing airfoil for reentry with the suborbital [[SpaceShipOne]]. The wings on this craft rotate upward into the ''feather configuration'' that provides a [[shuttlecock]] effect. Thus SpaceShipOne achieves much more aerodynamic drag on reentry while not experiencing significant thermal loads.\n\nThe configuration increases drag, as the craft is now less streamlined and results in more atmospheric gas particles hitting the spacecraft at higher altitudes than otherwise. The aircraft thus slows down more in higher atmospheric layers which is the key to efficient reentry. Secondly the aircraft will ''automatically'' orient itself in this state to a high drag attitude.<ref>[http://science.howstuffworks.com/spaceshipone4.htm HowStuffWorks.com: SpaceShipOne]</ref>\n\nHowever, the velocity attained by SpaceShipOne prior to reentry is much lower than that of an orbital spacecraft, and engineers, including Rutan, recognize that a feathered reentry technique is not suitable for return from orbit.\n\nOn 4 May 2011, the first test on the [[SpaceShipTwo]] of the feathering mechanism was made during a glideflight after release\nfrom the White Knight Two.\n\nThe feathered reentry was first described by [[Dean R. Chapman|Dean Chapman]] of [[NACA]] in 1958.<ref name=\"NACA TN 4276\">{{cite journal | url=http://naca.larc.nasa.gov/reports/1958/naca-tn-4276/naca-tn-4276.pdf | title=An approximate analytical method for studying reentry into planetary atmospheres | author=Chapman, Dean R. | journal=[[NACA]] Technical Note 4276 |date=May 1958 | page=38 | archiveurl=http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19930085059_1993085059.pdf | archivedate=2011-04-07}}</ref> In the section of his report on ''Composite Entry'', Chapman described a solution to the problem using a high-drag device:\n\n{{quote|It may be desirable to combine lifting and nonlifting entry in order to achieve some advantages...

The larger the device, the smaller is the heating rate.\n\nNonlifting vehicles with shuttlecock stability are advantageous also from the viewpoint of minimum control requirements during entry.\n\n... an evident composite type of entry, which combines some of the desirable features of lifting and nonlifting trajectories, would be to enter first without lift but with a... drag device; then, when the velocity is reduced to a certain value... the device is jettisoned or retracted, leaving a lifting vehicle... for the remainder of the descent.}}\n\n==Inflatable heat shield reentry==\n[[Image:Inflatable Re-entry Vehicle Experiment.jpg|thumb|NASA engineers check IRVE|right]]\nDeceleration for atmospheric reentry, especially for higher-speed Mars-return missions, benefits from maximizing \"the drag area of the entry system.

Heat load selects the thickness of the TPS material stack.  Peak deceleration is of major importance for manned missions.  The upper limit for manned return to Earth from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) or lunar return is 10 Gs.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19740007423_1974007423.pdf  Pavlosky, James E., St. Leger, Leslie G., \"Apollo Experience Report - Thermal Protection Subsystem,\" NASA TN D-7564, (1974).]</ref>  For Martian atmospheric entry after long exposure to zero gravity, the upper limit is 4 Gs.<ref name=autogenerated1 />  Peak dynamic pressure can also influence the selection of the outermost TPS material if spallation is an issue.\n\nStarting from the principle of ''conservative design'', the engineer typically considers two [[worst case]] trajectories, the undershoot and overshoot trajectories.  The overshoot trajectory is typically defined as the shallowest allowable entry velocity angle prior to atmospheric [[Skip reentry|skip-off]].  The overshoot trajectory has the highest heat load and sets the TPS thickness.  The undershoot trajectory is defined by the steepest allowable trajectory.  For manned missions the steepest entry angle is limited by the peak deceleration.  The undershoot trajectory also has the highest peak heat flux and dynamic pressure.  Consequently, the undershoot trajectory is the basis for selecting the TPS material.  There is no \"one size fits all\" TPS material.  A TPS material that is ideal for high heat flux may be too conductive (too dense) for a long duration heat load.  A low density TPS material might lack the tensile strength to resist spallation if the dynamic pressure is too high.  A TPS material can perform well for a specific peak heat flux, but fail catastrophically for the same peak heat flux if the wall pressure is significantly increased (this happened with NASA's R-4 test spacecraft).<ref name=autogenerated1 />  Older TPS materials tend to be more labor-intensive and expensive to manufacture compared to modern materials.  However, modern TPS materials often lack the flight history of the older materials (an important consideration for a risk-averse designer).\n\nBased upon Allen and Eggers discovery, maximum aeroshell bluntness (maximum drag) yields minimum TPS mass.  Maximum bluntness (minimum ballistic coefficient) also yields a minimal [[terminal velocity]] at maximum altitude (very important for Mars EDL, but detrimental for military RVs).  However, there is an upper limit to bluntness imposed by aerodynamic stability considerations based upon ''shock wave detachment''. A shock wave will remain attached to the tip of a sharp cone if the cone's half-angle is below a critical value.  This critical half-angle can be estimated using perfect gas theory (this specific aerodynamic instability occurs below hypersonic speeds).  For a nitrogen atmosphere (Earth or Titan), the maximum allowed half-angle is approximately 60\u00b0.  For a carbon dioxide atmosphere (Mars or Venus), the maximum allowed half-angle is approximately 70\u00b0.  After shock wave detachment, an entry vehicle must carry significantly more shocklayer gas around the leading edge stagnation point (the subsonic cap).  Consequently, the aerodynamic center moves upstream thus causing aerodynamic instability.  It is incorrect to reapply an aeroshell design intended for Titan entry ([[Huygens probe]] in a nitrogen atmosphere) for Mars entry ([[Beagle 2|Beagle-2]] in a carbon dioxide atmosphere).{{cn|date=September 2016}}{{or|date=September 2016}}  Prior to being abandoned, the [[Mars probe program|Soviet Mars lander program]] achieved one successful landing ([[Mars 3]]), on the second of three entry attempts (the others were [[Mars 2]] and [[Mars 6]]).  The Soviet Mars landers were based upon a 60\u00b0 half-angle aeroshell design.\n\nA 45 degree half-angle sphere-cone is typically used for atmospheric probes (surface landing not intended) even though TPS mass is not minimized.  The rationale for a 45\u00b0 half-angle is to have either aerodynamic stability from entry-to-impact (the heat shield is not jettisoned) or a short-and-sharp heat pulse followed by prompt heat shield jettison.  A 45\u00b0 sphere-cone design was used with the DS/2 Mars [[impactor (spacecraft)|impactor]] and [[Pioneer Venus project|Pioneer Venus Probes]].\n\n==Notable atmospheric entry accidents==\n[[Image:Ingreso reentrada.svg|center|thumb|800px|Re-entry window\nA- Friction with air, B- In air flight.
