They must therefore be strong enough to bear the stress, whilst avoiding too much additional weight as that would in turn increase their [[inertia]].\n\nTo allow for variations in the alignment and distance between the driving and driven components, drive shafts frequently incorporate one or more [[universal joint]]s, [[jaw coupling]]s, or [[rag joint]]s, and sometimes a [[Rotating spline|splined joint]] or [[prismatic joint]].\n\n==History==\nThe term '''drive shaft''' first appeared during the mid 19th century.  In Storer's 1861 patent reissue for a [[Thickness planer|planing and matching machine]], the term is used to refer to the belt-driven shaft by which the machine is driven.<ref>Henry D. Stover, Improvement in Wood-Planing Machines, [http://www.google.com/patents?id=sUIdAAAAEBAJ U.S. Patent Reissue 1,190], May 21, 1861.</ref>  The term is not used in his original patent.<ref>Henry D. Stover, Planing Machine, [http://www.google.com/patents?id=zcJpAAAAEBAJ U.S. Patent 30,993], Dec. 18, 1860, 1861.</ref>  Another early use of the term occurs in the 1861 patent reissue for the Watkins and Bryson horse-drawn [[Sickle bar mower|mowing machine]].<ref>John DeLancy Watkins and Robert Bryson, Mowing Machines, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Yr1AAAAAcAAJ&pg=PT440 U.S. Patent Reissue 1,904], July 23, 1861.</ref>\nHere, the term refers to the shaft transmitting power from the machine's wheels to the gear train that works the cutting mechanism.\n\nIn the 1890s, the term began to be used in a manner closer to the modern sense.  In 1891, for example, Battles referred to the shaft between the transmission and driving [[bogie|trucks]] of his [[Climax locomotive]] as the drive shaft,<ref>Rush S. Battles, Locomotive, [http://www.google.com/patents?id=tnJPAAAAEBAJ U.S. Patent 455,154], June 30, 1891.</ref> and Stillman referred to the shaft linking the crankshaft to the rear axle of his [[shaft-driven bicycle]] as a drive shaft.<ref>Walter Stillman, Bicycle, [http://www.google.com/patents?id=XxVSAAAAEBAJ U.S. Patent 456,387], July 21, 1891.</ref>  In 1899, Bukey used the term to describe the shaft transmitting power from the wheel to the driven machinery by a [[universal joint]] in his [[Horse power (machine)|Horse-Power]].<ref>Dudley D. Bukey, Horse-Power, [http://www.google.com/patents?id=xL11AAAAEBAJ U.S. Patent 631,198], Aug. 15, 1899.</ref>  In the same year, Clark described his Marine Velocipede using the term to refer to the gear-driven shaft transmitting power through a [[universal joint]] to the propeller shaft.<ref>Charles Clark, Marine Velocipede, [U.S. Patent 637,547], Nov. 21, 1899.</ref>  Crompton used the term to refer to the shaft between the transmission of his steam-powered [[Steam car|Motor Vehicle]] of 1903 and the driven axle.<ref>Charles Crompton, Motor-Vehicle [http://www.google.com/patents?id=sJBHAAAAEBAJ U.S. Patent 718,097], Jan. 1903.</ref>\n\n==Automotive drive shaft==\n\n===Vehicles===\nAn [[automobile]] may use a longitudinal shaft to deliver power from an engine/transmission to the other end of the vehicle before it goes to the wheels.  A pair of short drive shafts is commonly used to send power from a central [[differential (mechanics)|differential]], [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], or [[transaxle]] to the wheels.\n[[Image:Universal joints shaft.jpg|thumb|A truck double propeller shaft]]\n\n==== Front-engine, rear-wheel drive ====\n{{Main|Front-engine, rear-wheel drive layout}}\nIn [[FR layout|front-engined, rear-drive]] vehicles, a longer drive shaft is also required to send power the length of the vehicle.  Two forms dominate:  The [[torque tube]] with a single [[universal joint]] and the more common [[Hotchkiss drive]] with two or more joints.  This system became known as ''[[Syst\u00e8me Panhard]]'' after the automobile company [[Panhard|Panhard et Levassor]] patented it. \n\nMost of these vehicles have a [[clutch]] and [[gearbox]] (or transmission) mounted directly on the engine, with a drive shaft leading to a final drive in the rear axle. When the vehicle is stationary, the drive shaft does not rotate. Some vehicles (generally sports cars, most commonly [[Alfa Romeo Alfetta|Alfa Romeo]]s or [[Porsche 924]]s), seeking improved weight balance between front and rear, use a rear-mounted [[transaxle]]. This places the clutch and transmission at the ''rear'' of the car and the drive shaft between them and the engine. In this case the drive shaft rotates continuously with the engine, even when the car is stationary and out of gear.\n\nA drive shaft connecting a rear differential to a rear wheel may be called a half-shaft.  The name derives from the fact that two such shafts are required to form one [[Axle#Drive axles|rear axle]].\n\nEarly automobiles often used [[chain drive]] or [[belt drive]] mechanisms rather than a drive shaft.  Some used electrical generators and motors to transmit power to the wheels.\n\n==== Front-wheel drive ====\nIn [[British English]], the term \"drive shaft\" is restricted to a transverse shaft that transmits power to the wheels, especially the front wheels.  A drive shaft connecting the gearbox to a rear differential is called a '''propeller shaft''', or '''prop-shaft'''.  A prop-shaft assembly consists of a propeller shaft, a [[slip joint]] and one or more [[universal joint]]s.  Where the engine and axles are separated from each other, as on [[four-wheel drive]] and [[rear-wheel drive]] vehicles, it is the propeller shaft that serves to transmit the drive force generated by the engine to the axles.\n\nSeveral different types of drive shaft are used in the automotive industry:\n* One-piece drive shaft\n* Two-piece drive shaft\n* Slip-in-tube drive shaft\n\nThe slip-in-tube drive shaft is a new type that improves crash safety. It can be compressed to absorb energy in the event of a crash, so is also known as a collapsible drive shaft.\n\n==== Four wheel and all-wheel drive ====\nThese evolved from the front-engine rear-wheel drive layout. A new form of transmission called the transfer case was placed between transmission and final drives in both axles. This split the drive to the two axles and may also have included reduction gears, a dog clutch or differential. At least two drive shafts were used, one from the transfer case to each axle. In some larger vehicles, the transfer box was centrally mounted and was itself driven by a short drive shaft. In vehicles the size of a [[Land Rover]], the drive shaft to the front axle is noticeably shorter and more steeply articulated than the rear shaft, making it a more difficult engineering problem to build a reliable drive shaft, and which may involve a more sophisticated form of universal joint.\n\nModern light cars with [[all-wheel drive]] (notably [[Audi]] or the [[Fiat Panda]]) may use a system that more closely resembles a front-wheel drive layout. The transmission and final drive for the front axle are combined into one housing alongside the engine, and a ''single'' drive shaft runs the length of the car to the rear axle. This is a favoured design where the torque is biased to the front wheels to give car-like handling, or where the maker wishes to produce both four-wheel drive and front-wheel drive cars with many shared components.\n\n===Drive shaft for Research and Development (R&D)===\nThe automotive industry also uses drive shafts at testing plants.\nAt an [[engine test stand]] a drive shaft is used to transfer a certain speed / torque from the [[Internal combustion engine]] to a [[dynamometer]].\nA \"shaft guard\" is used at a shaft connection to protect against contact with the drive shaft and\nfor detection of a shaft failure.\nAt a transmission test stand a drive shaft connects the prime mover with the transmission.\n\n== Motorcycle drive shafts ==\n[[File:BMW R32 hr TCE.jpg|thumb|right|The exposed drive shaft on BMW's first motorcycle, the [[BMW R32|R32]]]]\nDrive shafts have been used on [[motorcycle]]s since before WW1, such as the Belgian [[FN (motorcycle)|FN motorcycle]] from 1903 and the [[Stuart Turner (engineer)|Stuart Turner]] Stellar motorcycle of 1912. As an alternative to [[Chain drive|chain]] and [[Belt (mechanical)|belt]] drives, drive shafts offer relatively maintenance-free operation, long life and cleanliness. A disadvantage of shaft drive on a motorcycle is that [[gear#types|helical gearing]], [[spiral bevel gear]]ing or similar is needed to turn the power 90\u00b0 from the shaft to the rear wheel, losing some power in the process. On the other hand, it is easier to protect the shaft linkages and drive gears from dust, sand, and mud.\n\n[[BMW motorcycles|BMW]] has produced shaft drive motorcycles since 1923; and [[Moto Guzzi]] have built shaft-drive [[V-twin]]s since the 1960s. The British company, [[Triumph Motorcycles Ltd|Triumph]] and the major Japanese brands, [[Honda]], [[Suzuki]], [[Kawasaki Motorcycle Corporation|Kawasaki]] and [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]], have produced shaft drive motorcycles. \n\n[[Lambretta]] motorscooters type A up to type LD where shaft-driven <ref>{{cite web|title=Lambretta Scooters Models|url=http://www.lambretta.co.uk/models.html|website=Cambridge Lambretta Workshop|accessdate=26 August 2016}}</ref> the NSU Prima scooter was also shaft-driven <ref>{{cite web|title=NSU Prima sales brochures|url=http://www.nsuprima.com/index2.html|website=NSU Prima|accessdate=26 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nMotorcycle engines positioned such that the [[Flat-twin|crankshaft is longitudinal and parallel to the frame]] are often used for shaft-driven motorcycles. This requires only one 90\u00b0 turn in power transmission, rather than two. Bikes from Moto Guzzi and BMW, plus the [[Triumph Rocket III]] and [[Honda ST series]] all use this engine layout.\n\nMotorcycles with shaft drive are subject to [[shaft effect]] where the chassis climbs when power is applied. This effect, which is the opposite of that exhibited by chain-drive motorcycles, is counteracted with systems such as BMW's [[Paralevel|Paralever]], Moto Guzzi's [[Moto Guzzi#CARC|CARC]] and Kawasaki's [[Kawasaki 1400GTR|Tetra Lever]].\n{{clear}}\n\n==Marine drive shafts==<!-- [[Propeller shaft (ship)]] links to this section -->\nOn a power-driven ship, the drive shaft, or propeller shaft, usually connects the transmission inside the vessel directly to the [[propeller]], passing through a [[stuffing box]] or other seal at the point it exits the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]]. There is also a [[thrust block]], a bearing to resist the axial force of the propeller. As the rotating propeller pushes the vessel forward, any length of drive shaft between propeller and thrust block is subject to [[compression (physical)|compression]], and when going astern to [[tension (mechanics)|tension]]. Except for the very smallest of boats, this force isn't taken on the gearbox or engine directly.\n\nCardan shafts are also often used in marine applications between the transmission and either a propeller gearbox or waterjet.\n\n==Locomotive drive shafts==\n[[File:Forks, Washington Shay Locomotive 1.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|The rear drive shaft, crankshaft and front drive shaft of a [[Shay locomotive]].]]\nThe [[Shay locomotive|Shay]], [[Climax locomotive|Climax]] and [[Heisler locomotive|Heisler]] locomotives, all introduced in the late 19th century, used [[quill drive]]s to couple power from a centrally mounted multi-cylinder engine to each of the [[bogie|trucks]] supporting the engine. On each of these [[geared steam locomotive]]s, one end of each drive shaft was coupled to the driven truck through a [[universal joint]] while the other end was powered by the [[crankshaft]], [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] or another truck through a second universal joint. A quill drive also has the ability to slide lengthways, effectively varying its length. This is required to allow the bogies to rotate when passing a curve.\n\nCardan shafts are used in some [[diesel locomotive]]s (mainly diesel-hydraulics, such as [[British Rail Class 52]]) and some [[electric locomotive]]s (e.g. [[British Rail Class 91]]). They are also widely used in [[diesel multiple unit]]s.\n\n==Drive shafts in bicycles==\n{{main|shaft-driven bicycle}}\n[[Image:Dsb-1.jpg|thumb|right|A [[shaft-driven bicycle]].]]\nThe drive shaft has served as an alternative to a chain-drive in [[bicycle]]s for the past century, never becoming very popular. A [[shaft-driven bicycle]] (or \"Acatane\", from an early maker) has several advantages and disadvantages:\n\n===Advantages===\n*Drive system is less likely to become jammed, a common problem with chain-driven bicycles\n*The rider cannot become dirtied from chain grease or injured by \"Chain bite\" when clothing or a body part catches between an [[Gear case|unguarded chain]] and a sprocket\n*Lower maintenance than a chain system when the drive shaft is enclosed in a tube\n*More consistent performance. Dynamic Bicycles claims that a drive shaft bicycle can deliver 94% efficiency, whereas a chain-driven bike can deliver anywhere from 75-97% efficiency based on condition\n*Greater [[ground clearance]]: lacking a [[Derailleur gears|derailleur]] or other low-hanging machinery, the bicycle has nearly twice the ground clearance\n\n===Disadvantages===\n*A drive shaft system weighs more than a chain system, usually 1-2 [[Pound (mass)|pounds]] heavier\n*Many of the advantages claimed by drive shaft's proponents can be achieved on a chain-driven bicycle, such as [[Gear case|covering the chain and gears]]\n*Use of lightweight [[derailleur]] gears with a high number of ratios is impossible, although [[hub gears]] can be used\n*Wheel removal can be complicated in some designs (as it is for some chain-driven bicycles with hub gears).\n\n==Drive shaft production==\nNowadays new possibilities exists for the production process of drive shafts. The [[filament winding]] production process is gaining popularity for the creation of [[Composite material|composite]] drive shafts. Several companies in the automotive industry are looking to adopt this knowledge for their high volume production process.{{cn|date=June 2016}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Girolamo Cardano]]\n*[[Giubo]]\n*[[Power take-off]]\n*[[Quill drive]]\n*[[Shaft alignment]]\n*[[Shaft collar]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n\n{{Powertrain}}\n{{Motorcycle components}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Drive Shaft}}\n[[Category:Vehicle parts]]\n[[Category:Mechanical power control]]\n[[Category:Mechanical power transmission]]\n[[Category:Shaft drives]]"}]}}}}
