The structural color has been simply explained as the interference due to alternating layers of cuticle and air using a model of [[Thin-film interference|multilayer interference]]. The same principles behind the coloration of [[soap bubble]]s apply to butterfly wings. The color of butterfly wings is due to multiple instances of constructive [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] from structures such as this.

The photonic microstructures can be replicated using metal oxides or metal alkoxides such as titanium sulfate (TiSO<sub>4</sub>), [[zirconium oxide]] (ZrO<sub>2</sub>), and [[aluminium oxide]] (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).
