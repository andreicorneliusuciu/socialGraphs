It is used to accelerate a hot, pressurized [[gas]] passing through it to a higher [[supersonic]] speed in the axial (thrust) direction, by converting the heat energy of the flow into [[kinetic energy]]. Because of this, the [[nozzle]] is widely used in some types of [[steam turbines]] and [[rocket engine nozzle]]s. It also sees use in supersonic [[jet engines]].\n\nSimilar flow properties have been applied to [[Jet (fluid)|jet streams]] within [[astrophysics]].<ref>{{cite book| author= C.J. Clarke and B.

Very nearly all modern rocket engines that employ hot gas combustion use de Laval nozzles.\n\n==Operation==\n\nIts operation relies on the different properties of gases flowing at [[Speed of sound|subsonic]] and [[supersonic]] speeds. The speed of a subsonic flow of gas will increase if the pipe carrying it narrows because the [[mass flow rate]] is constant. The gas flow through a de Laval nozzle is [[Isentropic process#Isentropic flow|isentropic]] (gas [[entropy]] is nearly constant). In a subsonic flow the gas is compressible, and [[sound]] will propagate through it. At the \"throat\", where the cross-sectional area is at its minimum, the gas velocity locally becomes sonic (Mach number = 1.0), a condition called [[choked flow]]. As the nozzle cross-sectional area increases, the gas begins to expand, and the gas flow increases to supersonic velocities, where a sound wave will not propagate backwards through the gas as viewed in the frame of reference of the nozzle ([[Mach number]] > 1.0).\n\n==Conditions for operation==\n\nA de Laval nozzle will only choke at the throat if the pressure and mass flow through the nozzle is sufficient to reach sonic speeds, otherwise no supersonic flow is achieved, and it will act as a [[Venturi tube]]; this requires the entry pressure to the nozzle to be significantly above ambient at all times (equivalently, the [[stagnation pressure]] of the jet must be above ambient).\n\nIn addition, the pressure of the gas at the exit of the expansion portion of the exhaust of a nozzle must not be too low. Because pressure cannot travel upstream through the supersonic flow, the exit pressure can be significantly below the [[ambient pressure]] into which it exhausts, but if it is too far below ambient, then the flow will cease to be [[supersonic]], or the flow will separate within the expansion portion of the nozzle, forming an unstable jet that may \"flop\" around within the nozzle, producing a lateral thrust and possibly damaging it.\n\nIn practice, ambient pressure must be no higher than roughly 2\u20133 times the pressure in the supersonic gas at the exit for supersonic flow to leave the nozzle.\n\n==Analysis of gas flow in de Laval nozzles==\n\nThe analysis of gas flow through de Laval nozzles involves a number of concepts and assumptions:\n\n* For simplicity, the gas is assumed to be an [[ideal gas]].\n* The gas flow is [[Isentropic process#Isentropic flow|isentropic]] (i.e., at constant [[entropy]]). As a result, the flow is [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]] (frictionless and no dissipative losses), and [[adiabatic process|adiabatic]] (i.e., there is no heat gained or lost).\n* The gas flow is constant (i.e., steady) during the period of the [[propellant]] burn.\n* The gas flow is along a straight line from gas inlet to exhaust gas exit (i.e., along the nozzle's axis of symmetry)\n* The gas flow behaviour is [[compressible flow|compressible]] since the flow is at very high [[velocities]] (Mach number > 0.3).\n\n==Exhaust gas velocity==\n\nAs the gas enters a nozzle, it is moving at [[Speed of sound|subsonic]] velocities. As the throat contracts, the gas is forced to accelerate until at the nozzle throat, where the cross-sectional area is the smallest, the axial velocity becomes [[mach number|sonic]]. From the throat the cross-sectional area then increases, the gas expands and the axial velocity becomes progressively more [[supersonic]].\n  \nThe linear velocity of the exiting exhaust gases can be calculated using the following equation:<ref>[http://www.nakka-rocketry.net/th_nozz.html Richard Nakka's Equation 12.]</ref><ref>[http://www.braeunig.us/space/propuls.htm#intro Robert Braeuning's Equation 1.22.]</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=George P.

Using those values in the above equation yields an exhaust velocity ''v''<sub>e</sub> = 2802&nbsp;m/s, or 2.80&nbsp;km/s, which is consistent with above typical values.\n\nThe technical literature can be very confusing because many authors fail to explain whether they are using the universal gas law constant ''R'', which applies to any [[ideal gas]], or whether they are using the gas law constant ''R<sub>s</sub>'', which only applies to a specific individual gas.  The relationship between the two constants is ''R<sub>s</sub>'' = ''R/M''.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Choked flow]]\n*[[Giovanni Battista Venturi]]\n*[[Gustaf de Laval]]\n*[[History of the internal combustion engine]]\n*[[Nozzle]]\n*[[Rocket engine]]\n*[[Rocket engine nozzles]]\n*[[Spacecraft propulsion]]\n*[[Twister Supersonic Separator]] for natural gas treatment\n*[[Venturi tube]]\n*[[Venturi effect]]\n* [[Isentropic nozzle flow]]\n*[[Daniel Bernoulli]]\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Convergent-divergent nozzles}}\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* Other applications of nozzle theory [http://www.transformacni-technologie.cz/en_proudeni-plynu-a-par-tryskami.html Flow of gases and steam through nozzles]\n\n[[Category:Nozzles]]\n[[Category:Rocket propulsion]]\n[[Category:Jet engines]]\n[[Category:Astrophysics]]\n\n[[es:Tobera#Tobera De Laval]]"}]}}}}
