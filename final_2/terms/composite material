The individual components remain separate and distinct within the finished structure. The new material may be preferred for many reasons: common examples include materials which are stronger, lighter, or less expensive when compared to traditional materials. More recently, researchers have also begun to actively include sensing, actuation, computation and communication into composites,<ref>[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/347/6228/1261689.abstract M.

For [[structural mortars]], he recommended ''[[pozzolana]]'', which were volcanic sands from the sandlike beds of [[Pozzuoli]] brownish-yellow-gray in colour near [[Naples]] and reddish-brown at [[Rome]]. Vitruvius specifies a ratio of 1 part lime to 3 parts pozzolana for cements used in buildings and a 1:2 ratio of lime to pulvis Puteolanus for underwater work, essentially the same ratio mixed today for concrete used at sea.<ref>Heather Lechtman and Linn Hobbs \"Roman Concrete and the Roman Architectural Revolution\", ''Ceramics and Civilization Volume 3: High Technology Ceramics: Past, Present, Future'', edited by W.D.

The glass fiber is relatively strong and stiff (but also brittle), whereas the polymer is ductile (but also weak and flexible). Thus the resulting fiberglass is relatively stiff, strong, flexible, and ductile.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Materials ===\n[[File:Concrete aggregate grinding.JPG|thumb|Concrete is a mixture of cement and aggregate, giving a robust, strong material that is very widely used.]]\n[[File:Spruce plywood.JPG|thumb|Plywood is used widely in construction]]\n[[Image:Glare honeycomb.jpg|thumb|Composite sandwich structure panel used for testing at NASA]]\n[[File:Composites Materials.png|thumb|{{cite web |url=http://www.kokch.kts.ru/me/t9/SIA_9_Composites.pdf |title= Structural Integrity Analysis : Composites}}]]\n[[Concrete]] is the most common artificial composite material of all and typically consists of loose stones (aggregate) held with a matrix of [[cement]]. Concrete is an inexpensive material, and will not compress or shatter even under quite a large compressive force. However, concrete cannot survive tensile loading (i.e., if stretched it will quickly break apart). Therefore, to give concrete the ability to resist being stretched, steel bars, which can resist high stretching forces, are often added to concrete to form [[reinforced concrete]].\n\n[[Fibre-reinforced plastic|Fibre-reinforced polymers]] or FRPs include [[carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer]] or CFRP, and [[glass-reinforced plastic]] or GRP. If classified by matrix then there are thermoplastic composites, [[short fiber thermoplastics]], [[long fibre thermoplastic]]s or long fibre-reinforced thermoplastics. There are numerous [[thermoset]] composites, including [[paper composite panels]].  Many advanced systems usually incorporate [[aramid]] [[fibre]] and carbon fibre in an [[epoxy resin]] matrix.\n\nShape memory polymer composites are high-performance composites, formulated using fibre or fabric reinforcement and shape memory polymer resin as the matrix. Since a shape memory polymer resin is used as the matrix, these composites have the ability to be easily manipulated into various configurations when they are heated above their activation temperatures and will exhibit high strength and stiffness at lower temperatures. They can also be reheated and reshaped repeatedly without losing their material properties. These composites are ideal for applications such as lightweight, rigid, deployable structures; rapid manufacturing; and dynamic reinforcement.\n\n[[High strain composite structure|High strain composites]] are another type of high-performance composites that are designed to perform in a high deformation setting and are often used in deployable systems where structural flexing is advantageous.  Although high strain composites exhibit many similarities to shape memory polymers, their performance is generally dependent on the fiber layout as opposed to the resin content of the matrix.\n\nComposites can also use metal fibres reinforcing other metals, as in [[metal matrix composite]]s (MMC) or [[Ceramic Matrix Composite|ceramic matrix composites]] (CMC), which includes [[bone mineral|bone]] ([[hydroxyapatite]] reinforced with [[collagen]] fibres), [[cermet]] (ceramic and metal) and [[concrete]]. Ceramic matrix composites are built primarily for [[fracture toughness]], not for strength.\n\nOrganic matrix/ceramic aggregate composites include [[asphalt concrete]], [[polymer concrete]], [[mastic asphalt]], [[mastic roller hybrid]], [[dental composite]], [[syntactic foam]] and [[nacre|mother of pearl]]. [[Chobham armour]] is a special type of [[composite armour]] used in military applications.\n\nAdditionally, thermoplastic composite materials can be formulated with specific metal powders resulting in materials with a density range from 2 g/cm\u00b3 to 11 g/cm\u00b3 (same density as lead). The most common name for this type of material is \"high gravity compound\" (HGC), although \"lead replacement\" is also used. These materials can be used in place of traditional materials such as aluminium, stainless steel, brass, bronze, copper, lead, and even tungsten in weighting, balancing (for example, modifying the centre of gravity of a tennis [[racquet]]), vibration damping, and radiation shielding applications. High density composites are an economically viable option when certain materials are deemed hazardous and are banned (such as lead) or when secondary operations costs (such as machining, finishing, or coating) are a factor.\n\nA [[sandwich-structured composite]] is a special class of composite material that is fabricated by attaching two thin but stiff skins to a lightweight but thick core. The core material is normally low strength material, but its higher thickness provides the sandwich composite with high [[bending]] [[stiffness]] with overall low [[density]].\n\nWood is a naturally occurring composite comprising cellulose fibres in a lignin and [[hemicellulose]] matrix. [[Engineered wood]] includes a wide variety of different products such as wood fibre board, [[plywood]], [[oriented strand board]], [[wood plastic composite]] (recycled wood fibre in polyethylene matrix), [[Pykrete]] (sawdust in ice matrix), Plastic-impregnated or laminated paper or textiles, [[Arborite]], [[Formica (plastic)]] and [[Micarta]]. Other engineered laminate composites, such as [[Mallite]], use a central core of end grain [[balsa wood]], bonded to surface skins of light [[alloy]] or GRP. These generate low-weight, high rigidity materials.\n\n=== Products ===\n\nFiber-reinforced composite materials have gained popularity (despite their generally high cost) in high-performance products that need to be lightweight, yet strong enough to take harsh loading conditions such as [[aerospace]] components ([[empennage|tail]]s, [[wing]]s, [[fuselage]]s, [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]]s), boat and [[scull]] hulls, [[bicycle]] frames and [[racing car]] bodies. Other uses include [[fishing rod]]s, [[storage tank]]s, swimming pool panels, and [[Composite baseball bat|baseball bats]]. The new [[Boeing 787]] structure including the wings and fuselage is composed largely of composites. Composite materials are also becoming more common in the realm of [[orthopedic surgery]].And It is the most common hockey stick material.\n\nCarbon composite is a key material in today's launch vehicles and [[heat shield]]s for the [[re-entry]] phase of [[spacecraft]]. It is widely used in solar panel substrates, antenna reflectors and yokes of spacecraft. It is also used in payload adapters, inter-stage structures and heat shields of [[launch vehicle]]s. Furthermore, [[disk brake]] systems of [[airplane]]s and racing cars are using [[carbon/carbon]] material, and the [[Ceramic Matrix Composite|composite material]] with [[carbon fiber]]s and [[silicon carbide]] matrix has been introduced in [[luxury vehicle]]s and [[sports car]]s.\n\nIn 2006, a fiber-reinforced composite pool panel was introduced for in-ground swimming pools, residential as well as commercial, as a non-corrosive alternative to galvanized steel.\n\nIn 2007, an all-composite military [[Humvee]] was introduced by TPI Composites Inc and Armor Holdings Inc, the first all-composite [[military vehicle]]. By using composites the vehicle is lighter, allowing higher payloads.  In 2008, carbon fiber and [[DuPont]] Kevlar (five times stronger than steel) were combined with enhanced thermoset resins to make military transit cases by ECS Composites creating 30-percent lighter cases with high strength.\n\nPipes and fittings for various purpose like transportation of potable water, fire-fighting, irrigation, seawater, desalinated water, chemical and industrial waste, and sewage are now manufactured in glass reinforced plastics.\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:Cfk heli slw.jpg|thumb|upright| Carbon fiber composite part.]]\n\nComposites are made up of individual materials referred to as constituent materials.  There are two main categories of constituent materials: matrix and reinforcement. At least one portion of each type is required. The matrix material surrounds and supports the reinforcement materials by maintaining their relative positions. The reinforcements impart their special mechanical and physical properties to enhance the matrix properties. A synergism produces material properties unavailable from the individual constituent materials, while the wide variety of matrix and strengthening materials allows the designer of the product or structure to choose an optimum combination.\n\nEngineered composite materials must be formed to shape. The matrix material can be introduced to the reinforcement before or after the reinforcement material is placed into the [[Molding (process)|mould]] cavity or onto the mould surface. The matrix material experiences a melding event, after which the part shape is essentially set. Depending upon the nature of the matrix material, this melding event can occur in various ways such as chemical [[polymerization]] or solidification from the melted state.\n\nA variety of moulding methods can be used according to the end-item design requirements. The principal factors impacting the methodology are the natures of the chosen matrix and reinforcement materials. Another important factor is the gross quantity of material to be produced. Large quantities can be used to justify high capital expenditures for rapid and automated manufacturing technology. Small production quantities are accommodated with lower capital expenditures but higher labour and tooling costs at a correspondingly slower rate.\n\nMany commercially produced composites use a [[polymer]] matrix material often called a resin solution. There are many different polymers available depending upon the starting raw ingredients. There are several broad categories, each with numerous variations. The most common are known as [[polyester]], [[vinyl ester]], [[epoxy]], [[Phenolic resin|phenolic]], [[polyimide]], [[polyamide]], [[polypropylene]], [[PEEK]], and others. The reinforcement materials are often fibres but also commonly ground minerals. The various methods described below have been developed to reduce the resin content of the final product, or the fibre content is increased. As a rule of thumb, lay up results in a product containing 60% resin and 40% fibre, whereas vacuum infusion gives a final product with 40% resin and 60% fiber content. The strength of the product is greatly dependent on this ratio.\n\nMartin Hubbe and Lucian A Lucia consider [[wood]] to be a natural composite of [[cellulose fibre]]s in a [[Matrix (biology)|matrix]] of [[lignin]].<ref>http://www.ncsu.edu/bioresources/BioRes_02/BioRes_02_4_534_535_Hubbe_L_BioResJ_Editorial_LoveHate.pdf</ref><ref>David Hon and Nobuo Shiraishi, eds. (2001) Wood and cellulose chemistry, 2nd ed. (New York: Marcel Dekker), p. 5 ff.</ref>\n\n==Constituents==\n\n===Matrices===\n\n====Organic====\n\nPolymers are common matrices (especially used for fiber reinforced plastics). Road surfaces are often made from [[asphalt concrete]] which uses [[bitumen]] as a matrix. Mud (wattle and daub) has seen extensive use. Typically, most common polymer-based composite materials, including fiberglass, carbon fiber, and [[Kevlar]], include at least two parts, the substrate and the resin.\n\nPolyester resin tends to have yellowish tint, and is suitable for most backyard projects. Its weaknesses are that it is UV sensitive and can tend to degrade over time, and thus generally is also coated to help preserve it. It is often used in the making of surfboards and for marine applications. Its hardener is a peroxide, often MEKP (methyl ethyl ketone peroxide).  When the peroxide is mixed with the resin, it decomposes to generate free radicals, which initiate the curing reaction.  Hardeners in these systems are commonly called catalysts, but since they do not re-appear unchanged at the end of the reaction, they do not fit the strictest chemical definition of a catalyst.\n\nVinylester resin tends to have a purplish to bluish to greenish tint. This resin has lower viscosity than polyester resin, and is more transparent. This resin is often billed as being fuel resistant, but will melt in contact with gasoline. This resin tends to be more resistant over time to degradation than polyester resin, and is more flexible. It uses the same hardeners as polyester resin (at a similar mix ratio) and the cost is approximately the same.\n\nEpoxy resin is almost totally transparent when cured. In the aerospace industry, epoxy is used as a structural matrix material or as a structural glue.\n\n[[Shape memory polymer]] (SMP) resins have varying visual characteristics depending on their formulation. These resins may be epoxy-based, which can be used for auto body and outdoor equipment repairs; cyanate-ester-based, which are used in space applications; and acrylate-based, which can be used in very cold temperature applications, such as for sensors that indicate whether perishable goods have warmed above a certain maximum temperature.  These resins are unique in that their shape can be repeatedly changed by heating above their [[glass transition]] temperature (T''<sub>g</sub>''). When heated, they become flexible and elastic, allowing for easy configuration. Once they are cooled, they will maintain their new shape. The resins will return to their original shapes when they are reheated above their T''<sub>g</sub>''. The advantage of shape memory polymer resins is that they can be shaped and reshaped repeatedly without losing their material properties. These resins can be used in fabricating shape memory composites.\n\n====Inorganic====\n\nCement (concrete), metals, ceramics, and sometimes glasses are employed. Unusual matrices such as ice are sometime proposed as in [[pykecrete]].\n\n===Reinforcements===\n\n====Fiber====\n[[File:Glass reinforcements.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Differences in the way the fibers are laid out give different strengths and ease of manufacture]]\nReinforcement usually adds rigidity and greatly impedes crack propagation. Thin fibers can have very high strength, and provided they are mechanically well attached to the matrix they can greatly improve the composite's overall properties.\n\n[[Fiber]]-reinforced composite materials can be divided into two main categories normally referred to as [[Short Fiber Reinforced Blends|short fiber-reinforced materials]] and continuous fiber-reinforced materials. Continuous reinforced materials will often constitute a layered or laminated structure. The woven and continuous fibre styles are typically available in a variety of forms, being pre-impregnated with the given matrix (resin), dry, uni-directional tapes of various widths, plain weave, harness satins, braided, and stitched.\n\nThe short and long fibers are typically employed in compression moulding and sheet moulding operations. These come in the form of flakes, chips, and random mate (which can also be made from a continuous fibre laid in random fashion until the desired thickness of the ply / laminate is achieved).\n\nCommon fibers used for reinforcement include glass fibers,  carbon fibers, cellulose (wood/paper fiber and straw) and high strength polymers for example [[aramid]]. [[Silicon carbide]] fibers are used for some high temperature applications.\n\n==== Other reinforcement ====\nConcrete uses [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]], and reinforced concrete additionally uses steel bars ([[rebar]]) to tension the concrete. Steel mesh or wires are also used in some glass and plastic products.\n\n===Cores===\nMany composite layup designs also include a co-curing or post-curing of the prepreg with various other media, such as honeycomb or foam. This is commonly called a [[Sandwich structured composite|sandwich structure]]. This is a more common layup for the manufacture of radomes, doors, cowlings, or non-structural parts.\n\nOpen- and closed-cell-structured [[foam]]s like [[polyvinylchloride]], [[polyurethane]], [[polyethylene]] or [[polystyrene]] foams, [[balsa|balsa wood]], [[syntactic foam]]s, and [[composite honeycomb|honeycomb]]s are commonly used core materials. Open- and closed-cell [[metal foam]] can also be used as core materials. Recently, 3D graphene structures ( also called graphene foam) have also been employed as core structures.A recent review by Khurram and Xu et al., have provided the summary of the state-of-the-art techniques for fabrication of the 3D structure of graphene, and the examples of the use of these foam like structures as a core for their respective polymer composites.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Khurram|first1=Shehzad|last2=Xu|first2=Yang|last3=Chao|first3=Gao|last4=Xianfeng|first4=Duan|title=Three-dimensional macro-structures of two-dimensional nanomaterials|journal=Chemical Society Reviews|date=2016|doi=10.1039/C6CS00218H}}</ref>\n\n== Fabrication methods ==\nFabrication of composite materials is accomplished by a wide variety of techniques, including: \n*[[Advanced fiber placement]] (Automated fiber placement)\n*[[Tailored fiber placement]]\n*[[Fiberglass spray lay-up process]]\n*[[Filament winding]]\n*[[Lanxide process]]\n*[[Tufting (composites)|Tufting]]\n*[[Z-pinning]]\n\nComposite fabrication usually involves wetting, mixing or saturating the [[Composite reinforcement|reinforcement]] with the [[Composite matrix|matrix]], and then causing the matrix to bind together (with heat or a chemical reaction) into a rigid structure. The operation is usually{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} done in an open or closed forming mold, but the order and ways of introducing the ingredients varies considerably.\n\n===Mold overview===\nWithin a mold, the reinforcing and matrix materials are combined, compacted, and cured (processed) to undergo a melding event. After the melding event, the part shape is essentially set, although it can deform under certain process conditions. For a thermoset polymeric matrix material, the melding event is a curing reaction that is initiated by the application of additional heat or chemical reactivity such as an organic peroxide. For a thermoplastic polymeric matrix material, the melding event is a solidification from the melted state. For a metal matrix material such as titanium foil, the melding event is a fusing at high pressure and a temperature near the melting point.\n\nFor many moulding methods, it is convenient to refer to one mould piece as a \"lower\" mould and another mould piece as an \"upper\" mould. Lower and upper refer to the different faces of the moulded panel, not the mould's configuration in space. In this convention, there is always a lower mould, and sometimes an upper mould. Part construction begins by applying materials to the lower mould. Lower mould and upper mould are more generalized descriptors than more common and specific terms such as male side, female side, a-side, b-side, tool side, bowl, hat, mandrel, etc. Continuous manufacturing uses a different nomenclature.\n\nThe moulded product is often referred to as a panel. For certain geometries and material combinations, it can be referred to as a casting. For certain continuous processes, it can be referred to as a profile.\n\n===Vacuum bag moulding===\nVacuum bag moulding uses a flexible film to enclose the part and seal it from outside air. Vacuum bag material is available in a tube  shape or a sheet of material. A vacuum is then drawn on the vacuum bag and atmospheric pressure  compresses the part during the cure. When a tube shaped bag is used, the entire part can be enclosed within the bag. When using sheet bagging  materials, the edges of the vacuum bag are sealed against the edges of the mould surface to enclose the part against an air-tight mould.  When bagged in this way, the lower mold is a rigid structure and the upper surface of the part is formed by the flexible membrane vacuum bag. The flexible membrane can be a reusable silicone material or an extruded polymer film. After sealing the part inside the vacuum bag, a vacuum is drawn on the part (and held) during cure. This process can be performed at either ambient or elevated temperature with ambient atmospheric pressure acting upon the vacuum bag. A vacuum pump is typically used to draw a vacuum. An economical method of drawing a vacuum is with a [[Aspirator (pump)|venturi vacuum]] and air compressor.\n\nA vacuum bag is a bag made of strong [[rubber]]-coated [[fabric]] or a polymer film used to compress the part during cure or hardening.  In some applications the bag encloses the entire material, or in other applications a [[mold]] is used to form one face of the laminate with the bag being a single layer to seal to the outer edge of the mold face.\nWhen using a tube shaped bag, the ends of the bag are sealed and the air is drawn out of the bag through a nipple using a [[vacuum pump]].  As a result, uniform pressure approaching one [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]] is applied to the surfaces of the object inside the bag, holding parts together while the [[adhesive]] [[Curing (chemistry)|cures]].  The entire bag may be placed in a temperature-controlled oven, oil bath or water bath and gently heated to accelerate curing.\n\nVacuum bagging is widely used in the composites industry as well.  [[carbon (fiber)|Carbon fiber]] fabric and [[glass (fiber)|fiberglass]], along with resins and epoxies are common materials laminated together with a vacuum bag operation.\n\n;Woodworking applications\nIn commercial woodworking facilities, vacuum bags are used to laminate curved and irregular shaped workpieces.\n\nTypically, polyurethane or vinyl materials are used to make the bag. A tube shaped bag  is open at both ends. The piece, or pieces to be glued are placed into the bag and the ends sealed. One method of sealing the open ends of the bag is by placing a clamp on each end of the bag. A plastic rod is laid across the end of the bag, the bag is then folded over the rod. A plastic sleeve with an opening in it, is then snapped over the rod. This procedure forms a seal at both ends of the bag, when the vacuum is ready to be drawn.\n\nA \"platen\" is sometimes used inside the bag for the piece being glued to lie on. The platen has a series of small slots cut into it, to allow the air under it to be evacuated. The platen must have rounded edges and corners to prevent the vacuum from tearing the bag.\n\nWhen a curved part is to be glued in a vacuum bag, it is important that the pieces being glued be placed over a solidly built form, or have an air bladder placed under the form. This air bladder has access to \"free air\" outside the bag. It is used to create an equal pressure under the form, preventing it from being crushed.<ref>{{cite web|url=  http://www.prowoodworkingtips.com/Vacuum_Systems_pg_4_-_Vacuum_bags.html|title= Vacuum Bags For Woodworking}}</ref>\n\n=== Pressure bag moulding ===\nThis process is related to vacuum bag molding in exactly the same way as it sounds. A solid female mold is used along with a flexible male mold. The reinforcement is placed inside the female mold with just enough resin to allow the fabric to stick in place (wet lay up). A measured amount of resin is then liberally brushed indiscriminately into the mold and the mold is then clamped to a machine that contains the male flexible mold. The flexible male membrane is then inflated with heated compressed air or possibly steam. The female mold can also be heated. Excess resin is forced out along with trapped air. This process is extensively used in the production of composite [[helmets]] due to the lower cost of unskilled labor. Cycle times for a helmet bag moulding machine vary from 20 to 45 minutes, but the finished shells require no further curing if the molds are heated.\n\n=== Autoclave moulding ===\nA process using a two-sided mould set that forms both surfaces of the panel. On the lower side is a rigid mould and on the upper side is a flexible membrane made from silicone or an extruded polymer film such as nylon. Reinforcement materials can be placed manually or robotically. They include continuous fibre forms fashioned into textile constructions. Most often, they are pre-impregnated with the resin in the form of [[Pre-preg|prepreg]] fabrics or unidirectional tapes. In some instances, a resin film is placed upon the lower mould and dry reinforcement is placed above. The upper mould is installed and vacuum is applied to the mould cavity. The assembly is placed into an [[Autoclave (industrial)|autoclave]]. This process is generally performed at both elevated pressure and elevated temperature. The use of elevated pressure facilitates a high fibre volume fraction and low void content for maximum structural efficiency.\n\n=== Resin transfer moulding (RTM) ===\nRTM is a process using a rigid two-sided mould set that forms both surfaces of the panel. The mould is typically constructed from aluminum or steel, but composite molds are sometimes used.  The two sides fit together to produce a mould cavity. The distinguishing feature of resin transfer moulding is that the reinforcement materials are placed into this cavity and the mould set is closed prior to the introduction of matrix material. Resin transfer moulding includes numerous varieties which differ in the mechanics of how the resin is introduced to the reinforcement in the mould cavity. These variations include everything from the RTM methods used in [[out of autoclave composite manufacturing]] for high-tech aerospace components to vacuum infusion (for resin infusion see also [[boat building]]) to vacuum assisted resin transfer moulding (VARTM). This process can be performed at either [[wikt:ambient|ambient]] or elevated temperature.\n\n=== Other fabrication methods===\nOther types of fabrication include press moulding, [[transfer moulding]], [[pultrusion]] moulding, [[filament winding]], [[casting]], centrifugal casting, [[continuous casting]] and [[slip forming]]. There are also forming capabilities including [[Numerical control|CNC]] filament winding, vacuum infusion, wet lay-up, [[compression moulding]], and [[thermoplastic]] moulding, to name a few. The use of curing ovens and paint booths is also needed for some projects.\n\n==== Finishing methods====\nThe finishing of the composite parts is also critical in the final design.  Many of these finishes will include rain-erosion coatings or polyurethane coatings.\n\n=== Tooling ===\nThe mold and mold inserts are referred to as \"tooling.\" The mold/tooling can be constructed from a variety of materials. Tooling materials include [[invar]], steel, [[aluminium]], reinforced [[silicone rubber]], [[nickel]], and [[carbon fiber]]. Selection of the tooling material is typically based on, but not limited to, the [[coefficient of thermal expansion]], expected number of cycles, end item tolerance, desired or required surface condition, method of cure, [[glass transition temperature]] of the material being moulded, moulding method, matrix, cost and a variety of other considerations.\n\n== Physical properties ==\nThe physical properties of composite materials are generally not [[isotropic]] (independent of direction of applied force) in nature, but rather are typically [[Anisotropy|anisotropic]] (different depending on the direction of the applied force or load). For instance, the stiffness of a composite panel will often depend upon the orientation of the applied forces and/or moments. Panel stiffness is also dependent on the design of the panel. For instance, the fibre reinforcement and matrix used, the method of panel build, thermoset versus thermoplastic, type of weave, and orientation of fibre axis to the primary force.\n\nIn contrast, isotropic materials (for example, aluminium or steel), in standard wrought forms, typically have the same stiffness regardless of the directional orientation of the applied forces and/or moments.\n\nThe relationship between forces/moments and strains/curvatures for an isotropic material can be described with the following material properties: [[Young's Modulus]], the [[shear Modulus]] and the [[Poisson's ratio]], in relatively simple mathematical relationships. For the anisotropic material, it requires the mathematics of a second order tensor and up to 21 material property constants. For the special case of orthogonal isotropy, there are three different material property constants for each of Young's Modulus, Shear Modulus and Poisson's ratio\u2014a total of 9 constants to describe the relationship between forces/moments and strains/curvatures.\n\nTechniques that take advantage of the anisotropic properties of the materials include [[mortise and tenon]] joints (in natural composites such as wood) and [[Pi Joints]] in synthetic composites.\n\n=== Failure ===\nShock, impact, or repeated cyclic stresses can cause the laminate to separate at the interface between two layers, a condition known as [[delamination]]. Individual fibres can separate from the matrix e.g. [[fiber pull-out|fibre pull-out]].\n\nComposites can fail on the [[microscopic]] or [[macroscopic]] scale. Compression failures can occur at both the macro scale or at each individual reinforcing fiber in compression buckling. Tension failures can be net section failures of the part or degradation of the composite at a microscopic scale where one or more of the layers in the composite fail in tension of the matrix or failure of the bond between the matrix and fibers.\n\nSome composites are brittle and have little reserve strength beyond the initial onset of failure while others may have large deformations and have reserve energy absorbing capacity past the onset of damage. The variations in fibers and matrices that are available and the [[mixture]]s that can be made with blends leave a very broad range of properties that can be designed into a composite structure.\nThe best known failure of a brittle ceramic matrix composite occurred when the carbon-carbon composite tile on the leading edge of the wing of the [[Space Shuttle Columbia]] fractured when impacted during take-off. It led to catastrophic break-up of the vehicle when it re-entered the Earth's atmosphere on 1 February 2003.\n\nCompared to metals, composites have relatively poor bearing strength.\n\n=== Testing ===\nTo aid in predicting and preventing failures, composites are tested before and after construction. Pre-construction testing may use [[finite element analysis]] (FEA) for ply-by-ply analysis of curved surfaces and predicting wrinkling, crimping and dimpling of composites.<ref name=\"Waterman\">{{Cite journal\n| author = Waterman, Pamela J.\n| title = The Life of Composite Materials\n| journal = Desktop Engineering Magazine\n| volume = April 2007\n| url = http://66.195.41.10/Articles/Feature/The-Life-of-Composite-Materials-200704101800.html\n}}</ref> Materials may be tested during manufacturing and after construction through several [[Nondestructive testing|nondestructive]] methods including ultrasonics, thermography, shearography and X-ray radiography,<ref>{{Cite journal\n| author = Matzkanin, George A.\n|author2=Yolken, H.
