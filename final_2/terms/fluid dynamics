It has several subdisciplines itself, including [[aerodynamics]] (the study of air and other gases in motion) and '''hydrodynamics''' (the study of liquids in motion).  Fluid dynamics has a wide range of applications, including calculating [[force]]s and [[moment (physics)|moment]]s on [[aircraft]], determining the [[mass flow rate]] of [[petroleum]] through pipelines, predicting [[weather]] patterns, understanding [[nebula]]e in [[interstellar space]] and modelling [[Nuclear weapon design|fission weapon]] detonation.  Some of its principles are even used in [[traffic engineering (transportation)|traffic engineering]], where traffic is treated as a continuous fluid, and crowd dynamics.  \n\nFluid dynamics offers a systematic structure\u2014which underlies these [[practical disciplines]]\u2014that embraces empirical and semi-empirical laws derived from [[flow measurement]] and used to solve practical problems.  The solution to a fluid dynamics problem typically involves calculating various properties of the fluid, such as [[flow velocity]], [[pressure]], [[density]], and  [[temperature]], as functions of space and time.\n\nBefore the twentieth century, ''hydrodynamics'' was synonymous with fluid dynamics.  This is still reflected in names of some fluid dynamics topics, like [[magnetohydrodynamics]] and [[hydrodynamic stability]], both of which can also be applied to gases.<ref>{{Cite book | title=The Dawn of Fluid Dynamics: A Discipline Between Science and Technology | first=Michael | last=Eckert | publisher=Wiley | year=2006 | isbn=3-527-40513-5 | page=ix }}</ref>\n\n==Equations of fluid dynamics==\nThe foundational axioms of fluid dynamics are the [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]]s, specifically, [[conservation of mass]],  [[conservation of momentum|conservation of linear momentum]] (also known as [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's Second Law of Motion]]), and [[conservation of energy]] (also known as [[First Law of Thermodynamics]]).  These are based on [[classical mechanics]] and are modified in [[quantum mechanics]] and [[general relativity]].  They are expressed using the [[Reynolds transport theorem|Reynolds Transport Theorem]].\n\nIn addition to the above, fluids are assumed to obey the ''continuum assumption''. Fluids are composed of molecules that collide with one another and solid objects. However, the continuum assumption assumes that fluids are continuous, rather than discrete. Consequently, it is assumed that properties such as density, pressure, temperature, and flow velocity are well-defined at [[infinitesimal]]ly small points and vary continuously from one point to another. The fact that the fluid is made up of discrete molecules is ignored.\n\nFor fluids that are sufficiently dense to be a continuum, do not contain ionized species, and have flow velocities small in relation to the speed of light, the momentum equations for [[Newtonian fluid]]s are the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]]\u2014which is a [[non-linear]] set of [[differential equations]] that describes the flow of a fluid whose stress depends linearly on flow velocity gradients and pressure. The unsimplified equations do not have a general [[Solution in closed form|closed-form solution]], so they are primarily of use in [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]].  The equations can be simplified in a number of ways, all of which make them easier to solve.  Some of the simplifications allow appropriate fluid dynamics problems to be solved in closed form.{{citation needed|date= May 2014}}\n\nIn addition to the mass, momentum, and energy conservation equations, a [[thermodynamics|thermodynamical]] equation of state giving the pressure as a function of other thermodynamic variables for the fluid is required to completely specify the problem. An example of this would be the [[Ideal gas law|perfect gas equation of state]]:\n\n:<math>p= \\frac{\\rho R_u T}{M}</math>\n\nwhere ''p'' is [[pressure]], \u03c1 is [[density]], ''R<sub>u</sub>'' is the [[gas constant]], ''M'' is [[molar mass]] and ''T'' is [[temperature]].\n===Conservation laws===\nThree conservation laws are used to solve fluid dynamics problems, and may be written in [[integral]] or [[Differential (infinitesimal)|differential]] form. Mathematical formulations of these conservation laws may be interpreted by considering the concept of a ''control volume''.  A control volume is a specified volume in space through which air can flow in and out.  Integral formulations of the conservation laws consider the change in mass, momentum, or energy within the control volume.  Differential formulations of the conservation laws apply [[Stokes' theorem]] to yield an expression which may be interpreted as the integral form of the law applied to an infinitesimal volume at a point within the flow. \n\n*[[Continuity equation#Fluid dynamics|Mass continuity]] (conservation of mass): The rate of change of fluid mass inside a control volume must be equal to the net rate of fluid flow into the volume.  Physically, this statement requires that mass is neither created nor destroyed in the control volume,<ref>Anderson, J.D., ''Fundamentals of Aerodynamics'', 4th Ed., McGraw\u2013Hill, 2007.</ref> and can be translated into the integral form of the continuity equation:\n::<math>{\\partial \\over \\partial t} \\iiint_V \\rho \\, dV = - \\, {} </math> {{oiint|preintegral = |intsubscpt =<math>{\\scriptstyle S}</math>|integrand = <math>{}\\,\\rho\\mathbf{u}\\cdot d\\mathbf{S}</math>}}\n\n:Above, <math>\\rho</math> is the fluid density, '''u''' is the [[flow velocity]] vector, and ''t'' is time.  The left-hand side of the above expression contains a triple integral over the control volume, whereas the right-hand side contains a surface integral over the surface of the control volume.  The differential form of the continuity equation is, by the [[divergence theorem]]:\n\n::<math>\\ {\\partial \\rho \\over \\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho \\mathbf{u}) = 0 </math>\n*[[Momentum|Conservation of momentum]]: This equation applies [[Newton's second law of motion]] to the control volume, requiring that any change in momentum of the air within a control volume be due to the net flow of air into the volume and the action of external forces on the air within the volume. In the integral formulation of this equation, [[body force]]s here are represented by ''f''<sub>body</sub>, the body force per unit mass.  [[Surface force]]s, such as viscous forces, are represented by '''<math>\\mathbf{F}_\\text{surf}</math>''', the net force due to [[Stress (mechanics)|stresses]] on the control volume surface.\n\n::<math> \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\iiint_{\\scriptstyle V} \\rho\\mathbf{u} \\, dV = -\\, {} </math> {{oiint|preintegral = |intsubscpt = <math>_{\\scriptstyle S}</math> |integrand}} <math> (\\rho\\mathbf{u}\\cdot d\\mathbf{S}) \\mathbf{u} -{}</math> {{oiint|intsubscpt = <math>{\\scriptstyle S}</math>|integrand = <math> {}\\, p \\, d\\mathbf{S}</math>}} <math>\\displaystyle{}+ \\iiint_{\\scriptstyle V} \\rho \\mathbf{f}_\\text{body} \\, dV + \\mathbf{F}_\\text{surf}</math>\n\n:The differential form of the momentum conservation equation is as follows.  Here, both surface and body forces are accounted for in one total force, ''F''.  For example, ''F'' may be expanded into an expression for the frictional and gravitational forces acting on an internal flow.\n::<math>\\ {D \\mathbf{u} \\over D t} = \\mathbf{F} - {\\nabla p \\over \\rho} </math>\n\n:In aerodynamics, air is assumed to be a [[Newtonian fluid]], which posits a linear relationship between the shear stress (due to internal friction forces) and the rate of strain of the fluid. The equation above is a vector equation: in a three-dimensional flow, it can be expressed as three scalar equations. The conservation of momentum equations for the compressible, viscous flow case are called the Navier\u2013Stokes equations.{{citation needed|date= May 2014}} \n*[[Conservation of energy]]: Although [[energy]] can be converted from one form to another, the total [[energy]] in a given closed system remains constant.\n\n::<math>\\ \\rho {Dh \\over Dt} = {D p \\over D t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\left( k \\nabla T\\right) + \\Phi </math>\n\n:Above, ''h'' is [[enthalpy]], ''k'' is the [[thermal conductivity]] of the fluid, ''T'' is temperature, and <math>\\Phi</math> is the viscous dissipation function. The viscous dissipation function governs the rate at which mechanical energy of the flow is converted to heat. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] requires that the dissipation term is always positive: viscosity cannot create energy within the control volume.<ref>White, F.M., ''Viscous Fluid Flow'', McGraw\u2013Hill, 1974.</ref> The expression on the left side is a [[material derivative]].\n\n===Compressible vs incompressible flow===\nAll fluids are [[compressibility|compressible]] to some extent; that is, changes in pressure or temperature cause changes in density. However, in many situations the changes in pressure and temperature are sufficiently small that the changes in [[density]] are negligible. In this case the flow can be modelled as an [[incompressible flow]]. Otherwise the more general [[compressible flow]] equations must be used.\n\nMathematically, incompressibility is expressed by saying that the density \u03c1 of a [[fluid parcel]] does not change as it moves in the flow field, i.e.,\n: <math>\\frac{\\mathrm{D} \\rho}{\\mathrm{D}t} = 0 \\, ,</math>\nwhere ''D''/''Dt'' is the [[substantial derivative]], which is the sum of [[time derivative|local]] and [[convective derivative]]s. This additional constraint simplifies the governing equations, especially in the case when the fluid has a uniform density.\n\nFor flow of gases, to determine whether to use compressible or incompressible fluid dynamics, the [[Mach number]] of the flow is evaluated. As a rough guide, compressible effects can be ignored at Mach numbers below approximately 0.3.  For liquids, whether the incompressible assumption is valid depends on the fluid properties (specifically the critical pressure and temperature of the fluid) and the flow conditions (how close to the critical pressure the actual flow pressure becomes).  [[acoustics|Acoustic]] problems always require allowing compressibility, since [[sound waves]] are compression waves involving changes in pressure and density of the medium through which they propagate.\n\n===Inviscid vs Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids===\n[[File:Potential flow around a wing.gif|thumb|Potential flow around an [[airfoil]]]]\n\nAll fluids are [[viscosity|viscous]], meaning that they exert some resistance to deformation: neighbouring parcels of fluid moving at different velocities exert viscous forces on each other. The velocity gradient is referred to as a [[strain (materials science)|strain rate]]; it has dimensions <math>T^{-1}</math>. [[Isaac Newton]] showed that for many familiar fluids such as [[water]] and [[Earth's atmosphere|air]], the [[stress (physics)|stress]] due to these viscous forces is linearly related to the strain rate. Such fluids are called [[Newtonian fluids]]. The coefficient of proportionality is called the fluid's [[viscosity]]; for Newtonian fluids, it is a fluid property independent of the strain rate. \n\n[[Non-Newtonian fluid]]s have a more complicated, non-linear stress-strain behaviour. The sub-discipline of [[rheology]] studies the stress-strain behaviours of these fluids, which include [[emulsion]]s and [[slurries]], some [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]] materials such as [[blood]] and some [[polymer]]s, and ''sticky liquids'' such as [[latex]], [[honey]] and [[lubricants]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe dynamic of fluid parcels is described with the help of [[Newton's second law]]. An accelerating parcel of fluid is subject to inertial effects. \n\nThe [[Reynolds number]] is a [[dimensionless quantity]] which characterises the magnitude of inertial effects compared to the magnitude of viscous effects. A low Reynolds number (''Re''<<1) indicates that viscous forces are very strong compared to inertial forces. In such cases, inertial forces are sometimes neglected; this flow regime is called [[Stokes flow|Stokes or creeping flow]]. \n\nOn the contrary, high Reynolds numbers (''Re''>>1) indicate that the inertial effects have more effect on the velocity field than the viscous (friction) effects. In high Reynolds number flows, the flow is often modeled as an [[inviscid flow]], an approximation in which [[viscosity]] is completely neglected. The [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations|Navier-Stokes equations]] then simplify into the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]]. Integrating these along a streamline in an inviscid flow yields [[Bernoulli's equation]]. When, in addition to being inviscid, the flow is [[Lamellar field|irrotational]] everywhere, Bernoulli's equation can be used throughout the flow field. Such flows are called [[potential flow]]s, because the velocity field may be expressed as the [[gradient]] of a potential.\n\nThis idea can work fairly well when the Reynolds number is high. However, problems such as those involving solid boundaries may require that the viscosity be included. Viscosity cannot be neglected near solid boundaries because the [[no-slip condition]] generates a thin region of large strain rate, the [[boundary layer]], in which [[viscosity]] effects dominate and which thus generates [[vorticity]]. Therefore, to calculate net forces on bodies (such as wings), viscous flow equations must be used: inviscid flow theory fails to predict [[Drag (physics)|drag forces]], a limitation known as the [[d'Alembert's paradox]]. \n\nA commonly used{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} model, especially in [[computational fluid dynamics]], is to use two flow models: the Euler equations away from the body, and [[boundary layer]] equations in a region close to the body. The two solutions can then be matched with each other, using the [[method of matched asymptotic expansions]].\n\n===Steady vs unsteady flow===<!-- [[Steady flow]] redirects here -->\n\n[[File:HD-Rayleigh-Taylor.gif|thumb|320px|Hydrodynamics simulation of the [[Rayleigh\u2013Taylor instability]] <ref>Shengtai Li, Hui Li \"Parallel AMR Code for Compressible MHD or HD Equations\" (Los Alamos National Laboratory) [http://math.lanl.gov/Research/Highlights/amrmhd.shtml]</ref> ]]\nWhen all the time derivatives of a flow field vanish, the flow is considered '''steady flow'''. Steady-state flow refers to the condition where the fluid properties at a point in the system do not change over time. Otherwise, flow is known as unsteady (also called transient<ref>[http://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/main/118306-transient-state-unsteady-state.html Transient state or unsteady state?]</ref>). Whether a particular flow is steady or unsteady, can depend on the chosen frame of reference. For instance, laminar flow over a [[sphere]] is steady in the frame of reference that is stationary with respect to the sphere. In a frame of reference that is stationary with respect to a background flow, the flow is unsteady.\n\n[[Turbulence|Turbulent]] flows are unsteady by definition. A turbulent flow can, however, be [[stationary process|statistically stationary]].  According to Pope:<ref>See Pope (2000), page 75.</ref>\n{{quote|\nThe random field ''U''(''x'',''t'') is statistically stationary if all statistics are invariant under a shift in time.\n}}\nThis roughly means that all statistical properties are constant in time. Often, the mean field is the object of interest, and this is constant too in a statistically stationary flow.\n\nSteady flows are often more tractable than otherwise similar unsteady flows. The governing equations of a steady problem have one dimension fewer (time) than the governing equations of the same problem without taking advantage of the steadiness of the flow field.\n\n===Laminar vs turbulent flow===\n[[Turbulence]] is flow characterized by recirculation, [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]], and apparent [[random]]ness.  Flow in which turbulence is not exhibited is called [[laminar flow|laminar]]. It should be noted, however, that the presence of eddies or recirculation alone does not necessarily indicate turbulent flow\u2014these phenomena may be present in laminar flow as well.  Mathematically, turbulent flow is often represented via a [[Reynolds decomposition]], in which the flow is broken down into the sum of an [[average]] component and a perturbation component.\n\nIt is believed that turbulent flows can be described well through the use of the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]]. [[Direct numerical simulation]] (DNS), based on the Navier\u2013Stokes equations, makes it possible to simulate turbulent flows at moderate Reynolds numbers. Restrictions depend on the power of the computer used and the efficiency of the solution algorithm. The results of DNS have been found to agree well with experimental data for some flows.<ref>See, for example, Schlatter et al, Phys. Fluids 21, 051702 (2009); {{doi|10.1063/1.3139294}}</ref>\n\nMost flows of interest have Reynolds numbers much too high for DNS to be a viable option,<ref>See Pope (2000), page 344.</ref> given the state of computational power for the next few decades.  Any flight vehicle large enough to carry a human (L > 3 m), moving faster than 72&nbsp;km/h (20&nbsp;m/s) is well beyond the limit of DNS simulation (Re = 4 million).  Transport aircraft wings (such as on an [[Airbus A300]] or [[Boeing 747]]) have Reynolds numbers of 40 million (based on the wing chord).  Solving these real-life flow problems requires turbulence models for the foreseeable future. [[Reynolds-averaged Navier\u2013Stokes equations]] (RANS) combined with [[turbulence modelling]] provides a model of the effects of the turbulent flow. Such a modelling mainly provides the additional momentum transfer by the [[Reynolds stresses]], although the turbulence also enhances the [[heat transfer|heat]] and [[mass transfer]]. Another promising methodology is [[large eddy simulation]] (LES), especially in the guise of [[detached eddy simulation]] (DES)\u2014which is a combination of RANS turbulence modelling and large eddy simulation.\n\n===Subsonic vs transonic, supersonic and hypersonic flows===\nWhile many terrestrial flows (e.g. flow of water through a pipe) occur at low mach numbers, many flows of practical interest (e.g. in aerodynamics) occur at high fractions of the Mach Number M=1 or in excess of it (supersonic flows). New phenomena occur at these Mach number regimes (e.g. shock waves for supersonic flow, transonic instability in a regime of flows with M nearly equal to 1, non-equilibrium chemical behaviour due to ionization in hypersonic flows) and it is necessary to treat each of these flow regimes separately.\n\n===Magnetohydrodynamics===\n{{main|Magnetohydrodynamics}}\n[[Magnetohydrodynamics]] is the multi-disciplinary study of the flow of [[electrical conduction|electrically conducting]] fluids in [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] fields. Examples of such fluids include [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]s, liquid metals, and [[Saline water|salt water]]. The fluid flow equations are solved simultaneously with [[Maxwell's equations]] of electromagnetism.\n\n===Other approximations===\nThere are a large number of other possible approximations to fluid dynamic problems. Some of the more commonly used are listed below.\n* The ''[[Boussinesq approximation (buoyancy)|Boussinesq approximation]]'' neglects variations in density except to calculate [[buoyancy]] forces. It is often used in free [[convection]] problems where density changes are small.\n* ''[[Lubrication theory]]'' and ''[[Hele\u2013Shaw flow]]'' exploits the large [[aspect ratio]] of the domain to show that certain terms in the equations are small and so can be neglected.\n* ''[[Slender-body theory]]'' is a methodology used in [[Stokes flow]] problems to estimate the force on, or flow field around, a long slender object in a viscous fluid.\n* The ''[[shallow-water equations]]'' can be used to describe a layer of relatively inviscid fluid with a [[free surface]], in which surface [[slope|gradients]] are small.\n* The ''[[Boussinesq equations (water waves)|Boussinesq equations]]'' are applicable to [[surface waves]] on thicker layers of fluid and with steeper surface [[slope]]s.\n* ''[[Darcy's law]]'' is used for flow in [[porous medium|porous media]], and works with variables averaged over several pore-widths.\n* In rotating systems, the ''[[quasi-geostrophic equations]]'' assume an almost [[Balanced flow#Geostrophic flow|perfect balance]] between [[pressure gradient]]s and the [[Coriolis force]]. It is useful in the study of [[atmospheric dynamics]].\n\n== Terminology in fluid dynamics ==\nThe concept of [[pressure]] is central to the study of both fluid statics and fluid dynamics.  A pressure can be identified for every point in a body of fluid, regardless of whether the fluid is in motion or not.  Pressure can be [[Pressure measurement|measured]] using an aneroid, Bourdon tube, mercury column, or various other methods.\n\nSome of the terminology that is necessary in the study of fluid dynamics is not found in other similar areas of study.  In particular, some of the terminology used in fluid dynamics is not used in [[fluid statics]].\n\n=== Terminology in incompressible fluid dynamics ===\nThe concepts of total pressure and [[dynamic pressure]] arise from [[Bernoulli's equation]] and are significant in the study of all fluid flows.  (These two pressures are not pressures in the usual sense\u2014they cannot be measured using an aneroid, Bourdon tube or mercury column.)  To avoid potential ambiguity when referring to [[pressure]] in fluid dynamics, many authors use the term [[static pressure]] to distinguish it from total pressure and dynamic pressure.  [[Static pressure]] is identical to [[pressure]] and can be identified for every point in a fluid flow field.\n\nIn ''Aerodynamics'', L.J. Clancy writes:<ref>Clancy, L.J. ''Aerodynamics'', page 21</ref> ''To distinguish it from the total and dynamic pressures, the actual pressure of the fluid, which is associated not with its motion but with its state, is often referred to as the static pressure, but where the term pressure alone is used it refers to this static pressure.''\n\nA point in a fluid flow where the flow has come to rest (i.e. speed is equal to zero adjacent to some solid body immersed in the fluid flow) is of special significance.  It is of such importance that it is given a special name\u2014a [[stagnation point]].  The static pressure at the stagnation point is of special significance and is given its own name\u2014[[stagnation pressure]].  In incompressible flows, the stagnation pressure at a stagnation point is equal to the total pressure throughout the flow field.\n\n=== Terminology in compressible fluid dynamics ===\nIn a compressible fluid, it is convenient to define the total conditions (also called stagnation conditions) for all thermodynamic state properties (e.g. total temperature, total enthalpy, total speed of sound).  These total flow conditions are a function of the fluid velocity and have different values in frames of reference with different motion.\n\nTo avoid potential ambiguity when referring to the properties of the fluid associated with the state of the fluid rather than its motion, the prefix \"static\" is commonly used (e.g. static temperature, static enthalpy).  Where there is no prefix, the fluid property is the static condition (i.e. \"density\" and \"static density\" mean the same thing).  The static conditions are independent of the frame of reference.\n\nBecause the total flow conditions are defined by [[isentropic]]ally bringing the fluid to rest, there is no need to distinguish between total entropy and static entropy as they are always equal by definition.  As such, entropy is most commonly referred to as simply \"entropy\".\n\n==See also==\n\n=== Fields of study ===\n{{columns-list|3|\n*[[Acoustic
