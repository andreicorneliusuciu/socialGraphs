An [[air compressor]] is a specific type of gas compressor.\n\nCompressors are similar to [[pump]]s: both increase the pressure on a [[fluid]] and both can transport the fluid through a [[pipe (material)|pipe]]. As gases are compressible, the compressor also reduces the volume of a gas. Liquids are relatively incompressible; while some can be compressed, the main action of a pump is to pressurize and transport liquids.\n\n==Types of compressors==\nThe main types of gas compressors are illustrated and discussed below:\n[[File:Gas-compressors-types-yed.png|frame|center]]\n\n===Positive displacement===\n\n====Reciprocating compressors====\n{{main article|Reciprocating compressor}}\n[[File:ReciprocatingCompressor.jpg|right|thumb|A motor-driven six-cylinder reciprocating compressor that can operate with two, four or six cylinders.]]\n\n'''Reciprocating compressors''' use [[piston]]s driven by a crankshaft.

Larger reciprocating compressors well over {{convert|1000|hp|abbr=on}} are commonly found in large industrial and petroleum applications. Discharge pressures can range from low pressure to very high pressure (>18000 psi or 180 MPa). In certain applications, such as air compression, multi-stage double-acting compressors are said to be the most efficient compressors available, and are typically larger, and more costly than comparable rotary units.<ref>[http://www.thomasnet.com/articles/machinery-tools-supplies/Industrial-Compressed-Air-Systems Introduction to Industrial Compressed Air Systems]</ref>\nAnother type of reciprocating compressor is the swash plate compressor, which uses pistons moved by a swash plate mounted on a shaft (see ''[[axial piston pump]]'').\n\nHousehold, home workshop, and smaller job site compressors are typically reciprocating compressors 1\u00bd&nbsp;hp or less with an attached receiver tank.\n\n====Ionic liquid piston compressor====\n{{main article|Ionic liquid piston compressor}}\nAn [[ionic liquid piston compressor]], ''ionic compressor'' or ''ionic liquid piston pump'' is a [[hydrogen compressor]] based on an [[ionic liquid]] piston instead of a metal piston as in a piston-metal [[diaphragm compressor]].<ref>[http://www.intermediates.basf.com/chemicals/web/en/function/conversions:/publish/images/products-and-industries/ionic-liquids/Achema_News_01_08.pdf New developments in pumps and compressors using Ionic Liquids]</ref>\n\n====Rotary screw compressors====\n[[File:RotaryScrewCompressor.gif|thumb|right|Diagram of a rotary screw compressor]]\n{{main article|Rotary screw compressor}}\n'''Rotary screw compressors''' use two meshed rotating positive-displacement [[Helix|helical screws]] to force the gas into a smaller space.<ref name=Perry/><ref>[http://www.blackmer.com/tech-screw.jsp Screw Compressor] Describes how screw compressors work and include photographs.</ref><ref>[http://www.domnickhunter.com/tech_Centre.asp?chapter=1&section=3_Screw-Compressors_2_3.htm&getIndex=false Technical Centre] Discusses oil-flooded screw compressors including a complete system flow diagram</ref> These are usually used for continuous operation in commercial and industrial applications and may be either stationary or portable.

The rotor is mounted offset in a larger housing that is either circular or a more complex shape. As the rotor turns, blades slide in and out of the slots keeping contact with the outer wall of the housing.<ref name=Perry/> Thus, a series of increasing and decreasing volumes is created by the rotating blades. Rotary Vane compressors are, with piston compressors one of the oldest of compressor technologies.\n\nWith suitable port connections, the devices may be either a compressor or a vacuum pump. They can be either stationary or portable, can be single or multi-staged, and can be driven by electric motors or internal combustion engines. Dry vane machines are used at relatively low pressures (e.g., {{convert|2|bar|kPa psi|abbr=on|disp=or}}) for bulk material movement while oil-injected machines have the necessary volumetric efficiency to achieve pressures up to about {{convert|13|bar|kPa psi|abbr=on}} in a single stage. A rotary vane compressor is well suited to electric motor drive and is significantly quieter in operation than the equivalent piston compressor.\n\nRotary vane compressors can have mechanical efficiencies of about 90%.<ref>[http://www.matteicomp.com/compressor-news.htm?id=165176063 Mattei Compressors]</ref>\n\n====Rolling piston====\n[[File:Rollkolbenverdichter.png|thumb|Rolling piston compressor]]\nRolling piston forces gas against a stationary vane.\n\n====Scroll compressors====\n[[File:Two moving spirals scroll pump.gif|thumb|right|Mechanism of a scroll pump]]\n{{main article|Scroll compressor}}\nA '''scroll compressor''', also known as '''scroll pump''' and '''scroll vacuum pump''', uses two interleaved spiral-like vanes to [[pump]] or compress [[fluid]]s such as [[liquids]] and [[gas]]es. The vane geometry may be [[involute]], [[archimedean spiral]], or hybrid curves.<ref>Tischer, J., Utter, R: \u201cScroll Machine Using Discharge Pressure For Axial Sealing,\u201d U.S. Patent 4522575, 1985.</ref><ref>Caillat, J., Weatherston, R., Bush, J: \u201cScroll-Type Machine With Axially Compliant Mounting,\u201d U.S. Patent 4767293, 1988.</ref><ref>Richardson, Jr., Hubert: \u201cScroll Compressor With Orbiting Scroll Member Biased By Oil Pressure,\u201d U.S. Patent 4875838, 1989.</ref> They operate more smoothly, quietly, and reliably than other types of compressors in the lower volume range.\n\nOften, one of the scrolls is fixed, while the other orbits eccentrically without rotating, thereby trapping and pumping or compressing pockets of fluid between the scrolls.\n\nDue to minimum clearance volume between the fixed scroll and the orbiting scroll, these compressors have a very high volumetric efficiency.\n\nThis type of compressor was used as the [[G-Lader|supercharger]] on Volkswagen G60 and G40 engines in the early 1990s.\n\n====Diaphragm compressors====\n{{main article|Diaphragm compressor}}\nA '''diaphragm compressor''' (also known as a '''membrane compressor''') is a variant of the conventional reciprocating compressor. The compression of gas occurs by the movement of a flexible membrane, instead of an intake element. The back and forth movement of the membrane is driven by a rod and a crankshaft mechanism. Only the membrane and the compressor box come in contact with the gas being compressed.<ref name=Perry/>\n\nThe degree of flexing and the material constituting the diaphragm affects the maintenance life of the equipment. Generally stiff metal diaphragms may only displace a few cubic centimeters of volume because the metal can not endure large degrees of flexing without cracking, but the stiffness of a metal diaphragm allows it to pump at high pressures. Rubber or silicone diaphragms are capable of enduring deep pumping strokes of very high flexion, but their low strength limits their use to low-pressure applications, and they need to be replaced as plastic embrittlement occurs.\n\nDiaphragm compressors are used for hydrogen and compressed natural gas ([[Compressed natural gas|CNG]]) as well as in a number of other applications.\n\n[[File:DiaphragmCompressor.jpg|thumb|right|A three-stage diaphragm compressor]]\nThe photograph on the right depicts a three-stage diaphragm compressor used to compress hydrogen gas to {{convert|6000|psi|MPa|abbr=on}} for use in a prototype [[compressed hydrogen]] and [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG) fueling station built in downtown [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by the [[Arizona Public Service]] company (an electric utilities company). [[Reciprocating compressor]]s were used to compress the [[natural gas]]. The reciprocating natural gas compressor was developed by [[Sertco]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Eric Slack | title=Sertco | date=Winter 2016 | url=http://www.emi-magazine.com/index.php/featured-content/1067-sertco | publisher=Phoenix Media Corporation | work=Energy and Mining International | accessdate=February 27, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe prototype [[alternative fuel]]ing station was built in compliance with all of the prevailing safety, environmental and building codes in Phoenix to demonstrate that such fueling stations could be built in urban areas.\n\n===Dynamic===\nDynamic compressors depend upon the [[inertia]] and [[momentum]] of a fluid.\n\n====Air bubble compressor====\nAlso known as a [[trompe]]. A mixture of air and water generated through turbulence is allowed to fall into a subterranean chamber where the air separates from the water. The weight of falling water compresses the air in the top of the chamber. A submerged outlet from the chamber allows water to flow to the surface at a lower height than the intake. An outlet in the roof of the chamber supplies the compressed air to the surface. A facility on this principle was built on the [[Montreal River (Timiskaming District)|Montreal River]] at Ragged Shutes near [[Cobalt, Ontario]] in 1910 and supplied 5,000 horsepower to nearby mines.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Maynard|first=Frank|date=November 1910|title=Five thousand horsepower from air bubbles|journal=Popular Mechanics|pages=Page 633|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-N0DAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\n====Centrifugal compressors====\n[[File:CentrifugalCompressor.jpg|thumb|right|A single stage centrifugal compressor]]\n{{main article|Centrifugal compressor}}\n'''Centrifugal compressors''' use a rotating disk or [[impeller]] in a shaped housing to force the gas to the rim of the impeller, increasing the velocity of the gas. A diffuser (divergent duct) section converts the velocity energy to pressure energy. They are primarily used for continuous, stationary service in industries such as [[oil refinery|oil refineries]], [[chemical plant|chemical]] and [[petrochemical]] plants and [[natural gas processing]] plants.<ref name=Perry >{{cite book\n  |author=Perry, R.H. and Green, D.W.

With multiple staging, they can achieve high output pressures greater than {{convert|10000|psi|MPa|abbr=on}}.\n\nMany large [[snowmaking]] operations (like [[ski resorts]]) use this type of compressor. They are also used in internal combustion engines as [[supercharger]]s and [[turbocharger]]s. Centrifugal compressors are used in small [[gas turbine]] [[engine]]s or as the final compression stage of medium-sized gas turbines.\n\n====Diagonal or mixed-flow compressors====\n'''Diagonal''' or '''mixed-flow compressors''' are similar to centrifugal compressors, but have a radial and axial velocity component at the exit from the rotor. The diffuser is often used to turn diagonal flow to an axial rather than radial direction.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n====Axial-flow compressors====\n[[File:Axial compressor.gif|thumb|right|An animation of an axial compressor.]]\n{{main article|Axial-flow compressor}}\n'''Axial-flow compressors''' are dynamic rotating compressors that use arrays of fan-like [[airfoil]]s to progressively compress a fluid. They are used where high flow rates or a compact design are required.\n\nThe arrays of airfoils are set in rows, usually as pairs: one rotating and one stationary. The rotating airfoils, also known as blades or ''rotors'', accelerate the fluid. The stationary airfoils, also known as ''stators'' or vanes, decelerate and redirect the flow direction of the fluid, preparing it for the rotor blades of the next stage.<ref name=Perry /> Axial compressors are almost always multi-staged, with the cross-sectional area of the gas passage diminishing along the compressor to maintain an optimum axial [[Mach number]]. Beyond about 5 stages or a 4:1 design pressure ratio a compressor will not function unless fitted with features such as stationary vanes with variable angles (known as variable inlet guide vanes and variable stators), the ability to allow some air to escape part-way along the compressor (known as interstage bleed) and being split into more than one rotating assembly (known as twin spools, for example).\n\nAxial compressors can have high efficiencies; around 90% [[polytropic]] at their design conditions. However, they are relatively expensive, requiring a large number of components, tight tolerances and high quality materials. Axial-flow compressors are used in medium to large [[gas turbine]] engines, natural gas pumping stations, and some chemical plants.\n\n===Hermetically sealed, open, or semi-hermetic===\n[[File:Ledni\u010dka Zanussi ZRA 319 SW, kompresor s odpa\u0159ovac\u00ed miskou (002).JPG|thumb|A small hermetically sealed compressor in a common consumer [[refrigerator]] or [[freezer]] typically has a rounded steel outer shell permanently welded shut, which seals operating gases inside the system. There is no route for gases to leak, such as around motor shaft seals. On this model, the plastic top section is part of an auto-defrost system that uses motor heat to evaporate the water.]]\n\nCompressors used in refrigeration systems are often described as being either hermetic, open, or semi-hermetic, to describe how the compressor and [[Electric motor|motor]] drive are situated in relation to the gas or vapor being compressed. The industry name for a hermetic is '''hermetically sealed compressor''', while a semi-hermetic is commonly called a '''semi-hermetic compressor'''.\n\nIn hermetic and most semi-hermetic compressors, the compressor and motor driving the compressor are integrated, and operate within the pressurized gas envelope of the system. The motor is designed to operate in, and be cooled by, the refrigerant gas being compressed.\n\nThe difference between the hermetic and semi-hermetic, is that the hermetic uses a one-piece welded steel casing that cannot be opened for repair; if the hermetic fails it is simply replaced with an entire new unit. A semi-hermetic uses a large cast metal shell with gasketed covers that can be opened to replace motor and pump components.\n\nThe primary advantage of a hermetic and semi-hermetic is that there is no route for the gas to leak out of the system. Open compressors rely on shaft seals to retain the internal pressure, and these seals require a lubricant such as oil to retain their sealing properties.\n\nAn open pressurized system such as an automobile air conditioner can be more susceptible to leak its operating gases. Open systems rely on lubricant in the system to splash on pump components and seals. If it is not operated frequently enough, the lubricant on the seals slowly evaporates, and then the seals begin to leak until the system is no longer functional and must be recharged. By comparison, a hermetic system can sit unused for years, and can usually be started up again at any time without requiring maintenance or experiencing any loss of system pressure.\n\nThe disadvantage of hermetic compressors is that the motor drive cannot be repaired or maintained, and the entire compressor must be replaced if a motor fails. A further disadvantage is that burnt-out windings can contaminate whole systems, thereby requiring the system to be entirely pumped down and the gas replaced. Typically, hermetic compressors are used in low-cost factory-assembled consumer goods where the cost of repair is high compared to the value of the device, and it would be more economical to just purchase a new device.\n\nAn advantage of open compressors is that they can be driven by non-electric power sources, such as an [[internal combustion engine]] or [[turbine]]. However, open compressors that drive refrigeration systems are generally not totally ''maintenance-free'' throughout the life of the system, since some gas leakage will occur over time.\n\n==Thermodynamics of Gas Compression==\n\n===Isentropic Compressor===\nA compressor can be idealized as internally reversible and [[adiabatic]], thus an [[isentropic]] steady state device, meaning the change in [[entropy]] is 0.<ref name=\"Cengel, Yunus A. 2012\">Cengel, Yunus A., and Michaeul A.

For the polytropic process (<math> Pv^n = constant </math>) work in decreases as the exponent, n, decreases, by increasing the heat rejection during the compression process. One common way of cooling the gas during compression is to use cooling jackets around the casing of the compressor.<ref name=\"Cengel, Yunus A. 2012\"/>\n\n===Compressors in Ideal Thermodynamic Cycles===\nIdeal [[Rankine Cycle]] 1->2 [[Isentropic]] compression in a [[pump]]\n<br />\nIdeal [[Carnot Cycle]] 4->1 [[Isentropic]] compression\n<br />\nIdeal [[Otto Cycle]] 1->2 [[Isentropic]] compression\n<br />\nIdeal [[Diesel Cycle]] 1->2 [[Isentropic]] compression\n<br />\nIdeal [[Brayton Cycle]] 1->2 [[Isentropic]] compression in a compressor\n<br />\nIdeal [[Vapor-compression refrigeration | Vapor-compression refrigeration Cycle]] 1->2 [[Isentropic]] compression in a compressor\n<br />\nNOTE: The isentropic assumptions are only applicable with ideal cycles. Real world cycles have inherent losses due to inefficient compressors and turbines. The real world system are not truly isentropic but are rather idealized as isentropic for calculation purposes.\n\n==Temperature==\n{{main article|Gas laws}}\nCompression of a gas increases its [[temperature]].\n: <math>W = \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} p dV = p_1 V_1^n \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} V^{-n} dV</math>\n\nwhere\n: <math>\\frac { p_2 }{ p_1 }\\ = \\left( \\frac{ V_1 } { V_2 }\\ \\right) ^ n</math>\nor\n: <math>p_1 V_1^n = p_2 V_2^n = p V^n</math>\nand\n: <math>p = \\frac {p_1 V_1^n}{V^n} </math>\n\nso\n: <math>W = \\frac {{p_1} {V_1^n}} {1-n}\\ ( {V_2^{1-n}} - {V_1^{1-n}} ) </math>\n\nin which ''p'' is pressure, ''V'' is volume, ''n'' takes different values for different compression processes (see below), and 1 & 2 refer to initial and final states.\n\n* [[Adiabatic process|Adiabatic]] - This model assumes that no energy (heat) is transferred to or from the gas during the compression, and all supplied work is added to the internal energy of the gas, resulting in increases of temperature and pressure. Theoretical temperature rise is:<ref>''Perry's Chemical Engineer's Handbook'' 8th edition\nPerry, Green, page 10-45 section 10-76</ref>\n: <math> T_2 = T_1 \\left(\\frac {p_2}{p_1}\\right)^{(k-1)/k} </math>\nwith ''T''<sub>1</sub> and ''T''<sub>2</sub> in degrees [[Rankine scale|Rankine]] or [[kelvin]]s, ''p''<sub>2</sub> and ''p''<sub>1</sub> being absolute pressures and ''k'' = [[Heat capacity ratio|ratio of specific heat]]s (approximately 1.4 for air).  The rise in air and temperature ratio means compression does not follow a simple pressure to volume ratio. This is less efficient, but quick. Adiabatic compression or expansion more closely model real life when a compressor has good insulation, a large gas volume, or a short time scale (i.e., a high power level). In practice there will always be a certain amount of heat flow out of the compressed gas. Thus, making a perfect adiabatic compressor would require perfect heat insulation of all parts of the machine. For example, even a bicycle tire pump's metal tube becomes hot as you compress the air to fill a tire.\nThe relation between temperature and compression ratio described above means that the value of n for an adiabatic process is k (the ratio of specific heats).\n\n* [[Isothermal process|Isothermal]] - This model assumes that the compressed gas remains at a constant temperature throughout the compression or expansion process. In this cycle, internal energy is removed from the system as heat at the same rate that it is added by the mechanical work of compression. Isothermal compression or expansion more closely models real life when the compressor has a large heat exchanging surface, a small gas volume, or a long time scale (i.e., a small power level). Compressors that utilize inter-stage cooling between compression stages come closest to achieving perfect isothermal compression. However, with practical devices perfect isothermal compression is not attainable. For example, unless you have an infinite number of compression stages with corresponding intercoolers, you will never achieve perfect isothermal compression.\n\nFor an isothermal process, n is 1, so the value of the work integral for an isothermal process is:\n: <math>W = - {p_1} {V_1} \\ln \\left( \\frac {p_2} {p_1}\\ \\right)</math>\n\nWhen evaluated, the isothermal work is found to be lower than the adiabatic work.\n* [[Polytropic process|Polytropic]] - This model takes into account both a rise in temperature in the gas as well as some loss of energy (heat) to the compressor's components. This assumes that heat may enter or leave the system, and that input shaft work can appear as both increased pressure (usually useful work) and increased temperature above adiabatic (usually losses due to cycle efficiency). Compression efficiency is then the ratio of temperature rise at theoretical 100 percent (adiabatic) vs. actual (polytropic). Polytropic compression will use a value of n between 0 (a constant-pressure process) and infinity (a constant volume process). For the typical case where an effort is made to cool the gas compressed by an approximately adiabatic process, the value of n will be between 1 and k.\n\n==Staged compression==\nIn the case of centrifugal compressors, commercial designs currently do not exceed a compression ratio of more than a 3.5 to 1 in any one stage (for a typical gas). Since compression raises the temperature, the compressed gas is to be cooled between stages making the compression less adiabatic and more isothermal. The inter-stage coolers typically result in some partial condensation that is removed in [[vapor-liquid separator]]s.\n\nIn the case of small reciprocating compressors, the compressor flywheel may drive a cooling fan that directs ambient air across the [[intercooler]] of a two or more stage compressor.\n\nBecause rotary screw compressors can make use of cooling lubricant to reduce the temperature rise from compression, they very often exceed a 9 to 1 compression ratio. For instance, in a typical diving compressor the air is compressed in three stages. If each stage has a compression ratio of 7 to 1, the compressor can output 343 times atmospheric pressure (7 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7 = 343 [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]]s). ({{convert|343|atm|MPa ksi|sigfig=3|abbr=on|lk=out|disp=or}})\n\n==Drive motors==\nThere are many options for the motor that powers the compressor:\n* Gas [[turbine]]s power the axial and centrifugal flow compressors that are part of [[jet engine]]s.\n* [[Steam turbine]]s or [[water turbine]]s are possible for large compressors.\n* [[Electric motor]]s are cheap and quiet for static compressors. Small motors suitable for domestic electrical supplies use [[Single-phase electric power|single-phase]] [[alternating current]]. Larger motors can only be used where an industrial electrical [[Three-phase electric power|three phase]] alternating current supply is available.\n* [[Diesel engine]]s or [[petrol engine]]s are suitable for portable compressors and support compressors. \n* In automobiles and other types of vehicles (including piston-powered airplanes, boats, trucks, etc.), diesel or gasoline engines power output can be increased by compressing the intake air, so that more fuel can be burned per cycle. These engines can power compressors using their own crankshaft power (this setup known as a [[supercharger]]), or, use their exhaust gas to drive a turbine connected to the compressor (this setup known as a [[turbocharger]]).\n\n==Applications==\nGas compressors are used in various applications where either higher pressures or lower volumes of gas are needed:\n* In [[pipeline transport]] of purified natural gas from the production site to the consumer, a compressor is driven by a gas turbine fueled by gas bled from the pipeline. Thus, no external power source is necessary.\n* Petroleum refineries, natural gas processing plants, petrochemical and chemical plants, and similar large industrial plants require compressing for intermediate and end-product gases.\n* [[Refrigeration]] and [[air conditioner]] equipment use compressors to move [[heat]] in [[refrigerant]] cycles (see ''[[vapor-compression refrigeration]]'').\n* Gas turbine systems compress the intake [[combustion]] air.\n* Small-volume purified or manufactured gases require compression to fill high pressure cylinders for [[medical]], [[welding]], and other uses.\n* Various industrial, manufacturing, and building processes require [[compressed air]] to power [[pneumatic tools]].\n* In the manufacturing and blow moulding of PET plastic bottles and containers.\n* Some aircraft require compressors to maintain [[cabin pressurization]] at altitude.\n* Some types of [[jet engine]]s\u2014such as [[turbojet]]s and [[turbofan]]s)\u2014compress the air required for fuel combustion. The jet engine's [[turbine]]s power the combustion air compressor.\n* In [[SCUBA diving]], [[hyperbaric oxygen therapy]], and other life support devices, compressors put [[breathing gas]] into small volume containers, such as [[diving cylinder]]s.<ref name=evil >{{cite journal\n  |title=Compressed breathing air \u2013 the potential for evil from within.\n  |vauthors=Millar IL, Mouldey PG |year=2008 |volume=38 |pages=145\u201351 |journal=Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine |publisher=[[South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society]]\n  |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7964 |accessdate=2009-02-28\n}}</ref><ref name=oxyhackers >{{cite book |author=Harlow, V\n  |title=Oxygen Hacker's Companion |publisher=Airspeed Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-9678873-2-1\n}}</ref>\n* In [[surface supplied diving]], an air compressor frequently supplies low pressure air (10 to 20 bar) for breathing.\n* [[Submarine]]s use compressors to store air for later use in displacing water from buoyancy chambers to adjust depth.\n* [[Turbocharger]]s and [[supercharger]]s are compressors that increase [[internal combustion engine]] performance by increasing the mass flow of air inside the cylinder, so the engine can burn more fuel and hence produce more power.\n* [[Rail transport|Rail]] and heavy [[road transport]] vehicles use [[compressed air]] to operate [[Air brake (rail)|rail vehicle]] or [[Air brake (road vehicle)|road vehicle]] brakes\u2014and various other systems ([[door]]s, [[windscreen wiper]]s, [[engine]], [[gearbox]] control, etc.).\n* Service stations and auto repair shops use compressed air to fill pneumatic [[tire]]s and power pneumatic tools.\n* [[Fire piston]]s and [[heat pump]]s exist to heat air or other gasses, and compressing the gas is only a means to that end.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Diving air compressor P8046745.JPG|Diving air compressor in noise reduction cabinet\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{multicol|65%}}\n* [[Axial compressor]]\n* [[Cabin pressurization]]\n* [[Centrifugal fan]]\n* [[Compressed air]]\n* [[Electrochemical hydrogen compressor]]\n* [[Fire piston]]\n* [[Foil bearing]]\n* [[Gas compression heat pump]]\n* [[Guided rotor compressor]]\n* [[Hydrogen compressor]]\n* [[Linear compressor]]\n{{multicol-break}}\n* [[Liquid ring|Liquid ring compressor]]\n* [[Hydride compressor]]\n* [[Natterer compressor]]\n* [[Pneumatic cylinder]]\n* [[Pneumatic tube]]\n* [[Reciprocating compressor]] (piston compressor)\n* [[Roots blower]] (a lobe-type compressor)\n* [[Slip factor]]\n* [[Trompe]]\n* [[Vapor-compression refrigeration]]\n* [[Variable speed air compressor]]\n{{multicol-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gas Compressor}}\n[[Category:Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning]]\n[[Category:Gas compressors| ]]\n[[Category:Diving support equipment]]\n[[Category:Underwater work]]\n[[Category:Gas technologies]]\n[[Category:Industrial gases]]"}]}}}}
