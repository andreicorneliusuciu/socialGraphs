The intellectual origins of materials science stem from the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], when researchers began to use analytical thinking from [[chemistry]], [[physics]], and [[engineering]] to understand ancient, phenomenological observations in [[metallurgy]] and [[mineralogy]].<ref>{{cite book|last1= Eddy|first1= Matthew Daniel|title=The Language of Mineralogy: John Walker, Chemistry and the Edinburgh Medical School 1750-1800 |date= 2008 |publisher= Ashgate |url= https://www.academia.edu/1112014/The_Language_of_Mineralogy_John_Walker_Chemistry_and_the_Edinburgh_Medical_School_1750-1800_2008_}}</ref><ref name=smith>{{cite book |last= Smith |first= Cyril Stanley |authorlink= Cyril Stanley Smith |title= A Search for Structure |date= 1981 |publisher= MIT Press |isbn= 0262191911}}</ref> Materials science still incorporates elements of physics, chemistry, and engineering. As such, the field was long considered by academic institutions as a sub-field of these related fields. Beginning in the 1940s, materials science began to be more widely recognized as a specific and distinct field of science and engineering, and major technical universities around the world created dedicated schools of the study. \n:Materials science is a syncretic discipline hybridizing metallurgy, ceramics, solid-state physics, and chemistry. It is the first example of a new academic discipline emerging by fusion rather than fission.<ref>[[Rustum Roy]] (1979) interdisciplinary science on campus, pages 161\u201396 in ''Interdisciplinarity and Higher Education'', J.J.

The understanding of processing-structure-properties relationships is called the {{Section link||materials paradigm}}. This paradigm is used to advance understanding in a variety of research areas, including [[nanotechnology]], [[biomaterial]]s, and metallurgy. Materials science is also an important part of [[forensic engineering]] and [[failure analysis]] - investigating materials, products, structures or components which fail or which do not operate or function as intended, causing personal injury or damage to property. Such investigations are key to understanding, for example, the causes of various [[aviation accidents and incidents]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of materials science}}\n[[File:Sword bronze age (2nd version).jpg|thumb|200px|A late [[Bronze Age sword]] or dagger blade.]]\nThe material of choice of a given era is often a defining point. Phrases such as [[Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]], [[Iron Age]], and [[Industrial Revolution|Steel Age]] are great examples. Originally deriving from the manufacture of [[ceramic]]s and its putative derivative metallurgy, materials science is one of the oldest forms of engineering and applied science. Modern materials science evolved directly from [[metallurgy]], which itself evolved from mining and (likely) ceramics and the use of fire. A major breakthrough in the understanding of materials occurred in the late 19th century, when the American scientist [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] demonstrated that the [[thermodynamic]] properties related to [[atom]]ic structure in various [[phase (matter)|phases]] are related to the physical properties of a material. Important elements of modern materials science are a product of the [[space race]]: the understanding and [[engineering]] of the metallic [[alloy]]s, and [[silica]] and [[carbon]] materials, used in building space vehicles enabling the exploration of space. Materials science has driven, and been driven by, the development of revolutionary technologies such as [[rubber]]s, [[plastic]]s, [[semiconductor]]s, and [[biomaterial]]s.\n\nBefore the 1960s (and in some cases decades after), many ''materials science'' departments were named ''metallurgy'' departments, reflecting the 19th and early 20th century emphasis on metals. The growth of materials science in the United States was catalyzed in part by the [[DARPA|Advanced Research Projects Agency]], which funded a series of university-hosted laboratories in the early 1960s \"to expand the national program of basic research and training in the materials sciences.\"<ref name=martin-pip>{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Joseph D. |title=What's in a Name Change?

Materials can generally be divided into two classes: [[crystal]]line and [[amorphous|non-crystalline]]. The traditional examples of materials are [[metal]]s, [[semiconductor]]s, [[ceramic]]s and [[polymer]]s.<ref>Callister, Jr.,  Rethwisch. \"Materials Science and Engineering \u2013 An Introduction\" (8th ed.). John Wiley and Sons, 2009 p.5-6</ref> New and advanced materials that are being developed include [[nanomaterials]] and [[biomaterial]]s,<ref>Callister, Jr.,  Rethwisch. Materials Science and Engineering \u2013 An Introduction (8th ed.). John Wiley and Sons, 2009 p.10-12</ref> etc.\n \nThe basis of materials science involves studying the structure of materials, and relating them to their [[property|properties]]. Once a materials scientist knows about this structure-property correlation, they can then go on to study the relative performance of a material in a given application. The major determinants of the structure of a material and thus of its properties are its constituent chemical elements and the way in which it has been processed into its final form. These characteristics, taken together and related through the laws of [[thermodynamics]] and [[kinetics (physics)|kinetics]], govern a material's [[microstructure]], and thus its properties.\n\n===Structure===\nAs mentioned above, structure is one of the most important components of the field of materials science. Materials science examines the structure of materials from the atomic scale, all the way up to the macro scale. [[Characterization (materials science)|Characterization]] is the way materials scientists examine the structure of a material. This involves methods such as diffraction with [[X-ray]]s, [[electron]]s, or [[neutron]]s, and various forms of [[spectroscopy]] and [[chemical analysis]] such as [[Raman spectroscopy]], [[energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|energy-dispersive spectroscopy]] (EDS), [[chromatography]], [[thermal analysis]], [[electron microscope]] analysis, etc. Structure is studied at various levels, as detailed below.\n\n====Atomic structure====\nThis deals with the atoms of the materials, and how they are arranged to give molecules, crystals, etc. Much of the electrical, magnetic and chemical properties of materials arise from this level of structure. The length scales involved are in angstroms.\nThe way in which the atoms and molecules are bonded and arranged is fundamental to studying the properties and behavior of any material.\n\n====Nanostructure====\n{{Main|Nanostructure}}\n[[Image:Buckminsterfullerene-perspective-3D-balls.png|thumb|left|150px|[[Buckminsterfullerene]] nanostructure.]]\nNanostructure deals with objects and structures that are in the 1\u2014100&nbsp;nm range.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&id=BJIOBN00000200000400MR17000001&idtype=cvips&gifs=Yes |author= Cristina Buzea |author2= Ivan Pacheco |author3= Kevin Robbie |last-author-amp= yes |title= Nanomaterials and Nanoparticles: Sources and Toxicity |journal= Biointerphases |volume= 2 |date= 2007 |pages= MR17\u2013MR71 |doi=10.1116/1.2815690 |pmid=20419892 |issue=4}}</ref> In many materials, atoms or molecules agglomerate together to form objects at the nanoscale. This causes many interesting electrical, magnetic, optical, and mechanical properties.\n\nIn describing nanostructures it is necessary to differentiate between the number of dimensions on the [[nanoscale]]. [[Nanotextured surface]]s have ''one dimension'' on the nanoscale, i.e., only the thickness of the surface of an object is between 0.1 and 100&nbsp;nm. Nanotubes have ''two dimensions'' on the nanoscale, i.e., the diameter of the tube is between 0.1 and 100&nbsp;nm; its length could be much greater. Finally, spherical [[nanoparticle]]s have ''three dimensions'' on the nanoscale, i.e., the particle is between 0.1 and 100&nbsp;nm in each spatial dimension. The terms nanoparticles and [[ultrafine particle]]s (UFP) often are used synonymously although UFP can reach into the micrometre range. The term 'nanostructure' is often used when referring to magnetic technology. Nanoscale structure in biology is often called [[ultrastructure]].\n\nMaterials which atoms and molecules form constituents in the nanoscale (i.e., they form nanostructure) are called nanomaterials. Nanomaterials are subject of intense research in the materials science community due to the unique properties that they exhibit.\n\n====Microstructure====\n{{Main|Microstructure}}\n[[File:Pearlite.jpg|thumb|right|Microstructure of pearlite.]]\nMicrostructure is defined as the structure of a prepared surface or thin foil of material as revealed by a microscope above 25\u00d7 magnification. It deals with objects from 100&nbsp;nm to a few cm. The microstructure of a material (which can be broadly classified into metallic, polymeric, ceramic and composite) can strongly influence physical properties such as strength, toughness, ductility, hardness, corrosion resistance, high/low temperature behavior, wear resistance, and so on. Most of the traditional materials (such as metals and ceramics) are microstructured.\n\nThe manufacture of a perfect [[crystal]] of a material is physically impossible. For example, a crystalline material will contain [[crystallographic defect|defects]] such as [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitates]], grain boundaries ([[Hall\u2013Petch|Hall\u2013Petch relationship]]), interstitial atoms, vacancies or substitutional atoms. The microstructure of materials reveals these defects, so that they can be studied.\n\n====Macro structure====\nMacro structure is the appearance of a material in the scale millimeters to meters\u2014it is the structure of the material as seen with the naked eye.\n\n===Crystallography===\n{{Main|Crystallography}}\n[[Image:Perovskite.jpg|thumb|Crystal structure of a perovskite with a chemical formula ABX<sub>3</sub>.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Energetics and Crystal Chemical Systematics among Ilmenite, Lithium Niobate, and Perovskite Structures |author= A. Navrotsky |journal= Chem. Mater. |date= 1998 |volume= 10 |issue= 10 |pages= 2787\u20132793 |doi= 10.1021/cm9801901}}</ref>]]\nCrystallography is the science that examines the arrangement of atoms in crystalline solids. Crystallography is a useful tool for materials scientists. In single crystals, the effects of the crystalline arrangement of atoms is often easy to see macroscopically, because the natural shapes of crystals reflect the atomic structure. Further, physical properties are often controlled by crystalline defects. The understanding of crystal structures is an important prerequisite for understanding crystallographic defects. Mostly, materials do not occur as a single crystal, but in polycrystalline form, i.e., as an aggregate of small crystals with different orientations. Because of this, the powder diffraction method, which uses diffraction patterns of polycrystalline samples with a large number of crystals, plays an important role in structural determination.\nMost materials have a crystalline structure, but some important materials do not exhibit regular crystal structure. [[Polymer]]s display varying degrees of crystallinity, and many are completely noncrystalline. [[Glass]], some ceramics, and many natural materials are [[Amorphous solid|amorphous]], not possessing any long-range order in their atomic arrangements. The study of polymers combines elements of chemical and statistical thermodynamics to give thermodynamic and mechanical, descriptions of physical properties.\n\n===Bonding===\n{{Main|Chemical bonding}}\nTo obtain a full understanding of the material structure and how it relates to its properties, the materials scientist must study how the different atoms, ions and molecules are arranged and bonded to each other. This involves the study and use of [[quantum chemistry]] or [[quantum physics]]. [[Solid-state physics]], [[solid-state chemistry]] and [[physical chemistry]] are also involved in the study of bonding and structure.\n\n===Properties===\n{{Main|List of materials properties}}\nMaterials exhibit myriad properties, including the following.\n:*Mechanical properties, see [[Strength of materials]]\n:*Chemical properties, see [[Chemistry]]\n:*Electrical properties, see [[Electricity]]\n:*Thermal properties, see [[Thermodynamics]]\n:*Optical properties, see [[Optics]] and [[Photonics]]\n:*Magnetic properties, see [[Magnetism]]\nThe properties of a material determine its usability and hence its engineering application.\n\n===Synthesis and processing===\nSynthesis and processing involves the creation of a material with the desired micro-nanostructure. From an engineering standpoint, a material cannot be used in industry if no economical production method for it has been developed. Thus, the processing of materials is vital to the field of materials science.\n\nDifferent materials require different processing or synthesis methods. For example, the processing of metals has historically been very important and is studied under the branch of materials science named ''physical [[metallurgy]]''. Also, chemical and physical methods are also used to synthesize other materials such as [[polymer]]s, [[ceramic]]s, [[thin film]]s, etc. As of the early 21st century, new methods are being developed to synthesize nanomaterials such as [[graphene]].\n\n===Thermodynamics===\n{{Main|Thermodynamics}}\n[[Image:Eutektikum new.svg|thumb|left|250px|A phase diagram for a binary system displaying a eutectic point.]]\nThermodynamics is concerned with [[heat]] and [[temperature]] and their relation to [[energy]] and [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]]. It defines [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] variables, such as [[internal energy]], [[entropy]], and [[pressure]], that partly describe a body of matter or radiation. It states that the behavior of those variables is subject to general constraints, that are common to all materials, not the peculiar properties of particular materials. These general constraints are expressed in the four laws of thermodynamics.  Thermodynamics describes the bulk behavior of the body, not the microscopic behaviors of the very large numbers of its microscopic constituents, such as molecules. The behavior of these microscopic particles is described by, and the laws of thermodynamics are derived from, [[statistical mechanics]].\n\nThe study of thermodynamics is fundamental to materials science. It forms the foundation to treat general phenomena in materials science and engineering, including chemical reactions, magnetism, polarizability, and elasticity. It also helps in the understanding of phase diagrams and phase equilibrium.\n\n===Kinetics===\n{{Main|Chemical kinetics}}\n[[Chemical kinetics]] is the study of the rates at which systems that are out of equilibrium change under the influence of various forces. When applied to materials science, it deals with how a material changes with time (moves from non-equilibrium to equilibrium state) due to application of a certain field. It details the rate of various processes evolving in materials including shape, size, composition and structure. [[Diffusion]] is important in the study of kinetics as this is the most common mechanism by which materials undergo change.\n\nKinetics is essential in processing of materials because, among other things, it details how the microstructure changes with application of heat.\n\n==In research==\nMaterials science has received much attention from researchers. In most universities, many departments ranging from [[physics]] to [[chemistry]] to [[chemical engineering]], along with materials science departments, are involved in materials research. Research in materials science is vibrant and consists of many avenues. The following list is in no way exhaustive. It serves only to highlight certain important research areas.\n\n===Nanomaterials===\n{{Main|Nanomaterials}}\n[[File:CNTSEM.JPG|thumb|thumb|200px|A [[scanning electron microscopy]] image of carbon nanotubes bundles]]\nNanomaterials describe, in principle, materials of which a single unit is sized (in at least one dimension) between 1 and 1000 nanometers (10<sup>\u22129</sup> meter) but is usually 1\u2014100&nbsp;nm.\n\nNanomaterials research takes a materials science-based approach to [[nanotechnology]], leveraging advances in materials [[metrology]] and synthesis which have been developed in support of [[microfabrication]] research.  Materials with structure at the nanoscale often have unique optical, electronic, or mechanical properties.\n\nThe field of nanomaterials is loosely organized, like the traditional field of chemistry, into organic (carbon-based) nanomaterials such as fullerenes, and inorganic nanomaterials based on other elements, such as silicon. Examples of nanomaterials include [[fullerene]]s, [[carbon nanotube|carbon nanotubes]], [[nanocrystal]]s, etc.\n\n===Biomaterials===\n{{Main|Biomaterial}}\n[[File:NautilusCutawayLogarithmicSpiral.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The iridescent [[nacre]] inside a [[nautilus]] shell.]]\nA biomaterial is any matter, surface, or construct that interacts with biological systems.  As a science, ''bio materials'' is about fifty years old.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} The study of biomaterials is called ''bio materials science''. It has experienced steady and strong growth over its history, with many companies investing large amounts of money into developing new products. Biomaterials science encompasses elements of [[medicine]], [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[tissue engineering]], and materials science.\n\nBiomaterials can be derived either from nature or synthesized in a laboratory using a variety of chemical approaches using metallic components, [[polymer]]s, [[bioceramic|ceramics]], or [[composite material]]s. They are often used and/or adapted for a medical application, and thus comprises whole or part of a living structure or biomedical device which performs, augments, or replaces a natural function. Such functions may be benign, like being used for a [[heart valve]], or may be [[bioactive]] with a more interactive functionality such as [[hydroxylapatite]] coated [[hip implant]]s. Biomaterials are also used everyday in dental applications, surgery, and drug delivery. For example, a construct with impregnated pharmaceutical products can be placed into the body, which permits the prolonged release of a drug over an extended period of time. A biomaterial may also be an [[autograft]], [[allograft]] or [[xenograft]] used as an [[organ transplant]] material.\n\n===Electronic, optical, and magnetic===\n[[File:Split-ring resonator array 10K sq nm.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Negative index metamaterial]].<ref name=APhys1>{{cite journal|last=Shelby |first=R.

These materials form the basis of our modern computing world, and hence research into these materials is of vital importance.\n\n[[Semiconductor]]s are a traditional example of these types of materials. They are materials that have properties that are intermediate between [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductors]] and [[insulator (electricity)|insulators]]. Their electrical conductivities are very sensitive to impurity concentrations, and this allows for the use of [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]] to achieve desirable electronic properties. Hence, semiconductors form the basis of the traditional computer.\n\nThis field also includes new areas of research such as [[superconductivty|superconducting]] materials, [[spintronics]], [[metamaterial]]s, etc. The study of these materials involves knowledge of materials science and [[solid-state physics]] or [[condensed matter physics]].\n\n===Computational science and theory===\nWith the increase in computing power, simulating the behavior of materials has become possible. This enables materials scientists to discover properties of materials formerly unknown, as well as to design new materials. Up until now, new materials were found by time consuming trial and error processes. But, now it is hoped that computational methods could drastically reduce that time, and allow tailoring materials properties. This involves simulating materials at all length scales, using methods such as [[density functional theory]], [[molecular dynamics]], etc.\n\n==In industry==\nRadical [[Timeline of materials technology|materials advances]] can drive the creation of new products or even new industries, but stable industries also employ materials scientists to make incremental improvements and troubleshoot issues with currently used materials. Industrial applications of materials science include materials design, cost-benefit tradeoffs in industrial production of materials, processing methods ([[casting]], [[rolling]], [[welding]], [[ion implantation]], [[crystal growth]], [[thin-film deposition]], [[sintering]], [[glassblowing]], etc.), and analytic methods (characterization methods such as [[electron microscopy]], [[X-ray crystallography|X-ray diffraction]], [[calorimetry]], [[Microprobe|nuclear microscopy (HEFIB)]], [[Rutherford backscattering]], [[neutron diffraction]], small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), etc.).\n\nBesides material characterization, the material scientist or engineer also deals with extracting materials and convering them into useful forms. Thus ingot casting, foundry methods, blast furnace extraction, and electrolytic extraction are all part of the required knowledge of a materials engineer. Often the presence, absence, or variation of minute quantities of secondary elements and compounds in a bulk material will greatly affect the final properties of the materials produced. For example, steels are classified based on 1/10 and 1/100 weight percentages of the carbon and other alloying elements they contain. Thus, the extracting and purifying methods used to extract iron in a blast furnace can affect the quality of steel that is produced.\n\n===Ceramics and glasses===\n{{Main|Ceramic}}\n[[Image:Si3N4bearings.jpg|thumb|200px|Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> ceramic bearing parts]]\nAnother application of material science is the structures of [[ceramic]]s and [[glass]], typically associated with the most brittle materials. Bonding in ceramics and glasses uses covalent and ionic-covalent types with SiO<sub>2</sub> (silica or sand) as a fundamental building block. Ceramics are as soft as clay or as hard as stone and concrete. Usually, they are crystalline in form. Most glasses contain a metal oxide fused with silica. At high temperatures used to prepare glass, the material is a viscous liquid. The structure of glass forms into an amorphous state upon cooling. Windowpanes and eyeglasses are important examples. Fibers of glass are also available. Scratch resistant Corning [[Gorilla Glass]] is a well-known example of the application of materials science to drastically improve the properties of common components. Diamond and carbon in its graphite form are considered to be ceramics.\n\nEngineering ceramics are known for their stiffness and stability under high temperatures, compression and electrical stress. Alumina, [[silicon carbide]], and [[tungsten carbide]] are made from a fine powder of their constituents in a process of sintering with a binder. Hot pressing provides higher density material. Chemical vapor deposition can place a film of a ceramic on another material. Cermets are ceramic particles containing some metals. The wear resistance of tools is derived from cemented carbides with the metal phase of cobalt and nickel typically added to modify properties.\n\n===Composites===\n{{Main|Composite material}}\n[[File:Cfaser haarrp.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A 6 \u03bcm diameter carbon filament (running from bottom left to top right) siting atop the much larger human hair.]] [[Fiber|Filaments]] are commonly used for reinforcement in [[composite material]]s.\nAnother application of materials science in industry is making [[composite material]]s. These are structured materials composed of two or more macroscopic phases. Applications range from structural elements such as steel-reinforced concrete, to the thermal insulating tiles which play a key and integral role in NASA's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system]] which is used to protect the surface of the shuttle from the heat of re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. One example is [[reinforced Carbon-Carbon]] (RCC), the light gray material which withstands re-entry temperatures up to {{convert|1510|C|F}} and protects the Space Shuttle's wing leading edges and nose cap. RCC is a laminated composite material made from [[graphite]] [[rayon]] cloth and impregnated with a [[phenolic resin]]. After curing at high temperature in an autoclave, the laminate is pyrolized to convert the resin to carbon, impregnated with furfural alcohol in a vacuum chamber, and cured-pyrolized to convert the [[furfural]] alcohol to carbon. To provide oxidation resistance for reuse ability, the outer layers of the RCC are converted to [[silicon carbide]].\n\nOther examples can be seen in the \"plastic\" casings of television sets, cell-phones and so on. These plastic casings are usually a [[composite material]] made up of a thermoplastic matrix such as [[acrylonitrile butadiene styrene]] (ABS) in which [[calcium carbonate]] chalk, [[talc]], [[glass fiber]]s or [[carbon fiber]]s have been added for added strength, bulk, or electrostatic dispersion. These additions may be termed reinforcing fibers, or dispersants, depending on their purpose.\n\n===Polymers===\n{{Main|Polymer}}\n[[File:Polypropylene.svg|thumb|left|200px|The repeating unit of the polymer polypropylene]]\n[[File:Expanded polystyrene foam dunnage.jpg|thumb|Expanded polystyrene polymer packaging.]]\n[[Polymer]]s are chemical compounds made up of a large number of identical components linked together like chains. They are an important part of materials science. Polymers are the raw materials (the resins) used to make what are commonly called plastics and rubber. Plastics and rubber are really the final product, created after one or more polymers or additives have been added to a resin during processing, which is then shaped into a final form. Plastics which have been around, and which are in current widespread use, include [[polyethylene]], [[polypropylene]], [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC), [[polystyrene]], [[nylon]]s, [[polyester]]s, [[acrylic resin|acrylics]], [[polyurethane]]s, and [[polycarbonate]]s and also rubbers which have been around are natural rubber, styrene butadiene rubber, chloroprene, and butadiene rubber. Plastics are generally classified as ''commodity'', ''specialty'' and ''engineering'' plastics.\n\nPolyvinyl chloride (PVC) is widely used, inexpensive, and annual production quantities are large. It lends itself to an vast array of applications, from [[artificial leather]] to [[electrical insulation]] and cabling, [[packaging]], and [[Food storage|containers]]. Its fabrication and processing are simple and well-established. The versatility of PVC is due to the wide range of [[plasticiser]]s and other additives that it accepts. The term \"additives\" in polymer science refers to the chemicals and compounds added to the polymer base to modify its material properties.\n\n[[Polycarbonate]] would be normally considered an engineering plastic (other examples include PEEK, ABS). Such plastics are valued for their superior strengths and other special material properties. They are usually not used for disposable applications, unlike commodity plastics.\n\nSpecialty plastics are materials with unique characteristics, such as ultra-high strength, electrical conductivity, electro-fluorescence, high thermal stability, etc.\n\nThe dividing lines between the various types of plastics is not based on material but rather on their properties and applications. For example, [[polyethylene]] (PE) is a cheap, low friction polymer commonly used to make disposable bags for shopping and trash, and is considered a commodity plastic, whereas [[medium-density polyethylene]] (MDPE) is used for underground gas and water pipes, and another variety called [[ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene]] (UHMWPE) is an engineering plastic which is used extensively as the glide rails for industrial equipment and the low-friction socket in implanted [[hip joint]]s.\n\n===Metal alloys===\n{{Main|Alloy}}\n[[File:Steel wire rope.png|thumb|200px|Wire rope made from [[steel]] alloy.]]\nThe study of metal alloys is a significant part of materials science. Of all the metallic alloys in use today, the alloys of iron ([[steel]], [[stainless steel]], [[cast iron]], [[tool steel]], [[alloy steel]]s) make up the largest proportion both by quantity and commercial value. Iron alloyed with various proportions of carbon gives low, mid and [[high carbon steel]]s. An iron carbon alloy is only considered steel if the carbon level is between 0.01% and 2.00%. For the steels, the [[hardness]] and tensile strength of the steel is related to the amount of carbon present, with increasing carbon levels also leading to lower ductility and toughness. Heat treatment processes such as quenching and tempering can significantly change these properties however. Cast Iron is defined as an iron\u2013carbon alloy with more than 2.00% but less than 6.67% carbon. Stainless steel is defined as a regular steel alloy with greater than 10% by weight alloying content of Chromium. Nickel and Molybdenum are typically also found in stainless steels.\n\nOther significant metallic alloys are those of [[aluminium]], [[titanium]], [[copper]] and [[magnesium]]. [[Copper alloys]] have been known for a long time (since the [[Bronze Age]]), while the alloys of the other three metals have been relatively recently developed. Due to the chemical reactivity of these metals, the electrolytic extraction processes required were only developed relatively recently. The alloys of aluminium, titanium and magnesium are also known and valued for their high strength-to-weight ratios and, in the case of magnesium, their ability to provide electromagnetic shielding. These materials are ideal for situations where high strength-to-weight ratios are more important than bulk cost, such as in the aerospace industry and certain automotive engineering applications.\n\n===Semiconductors===\n\nThe study of semiconductors is a significant part of materials science. A [[semiconductor]] is a material that has a resistivity between a metal and insulator. It's electronic properties can be greatly altered through intentionally introducing impurities, or doping. From these semiconductor materials, things such as [[diode]]s, [[transistor]]s, [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs), and analog and digital [[electric circuit]]s can be built, making them materials of interest in industry. Semiconductor devices have replaced thermionic devices (vacuum tubes) in most applications. Semiconductor devices are manufactured both as single discrete devices and as [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs), which consist of a number\u2014from a few to millions\u2014of devices manufactured and interconnected on a single semiconductor substrate.<ref>https://www.aip.org/jobs/profiles/semiconductor-industry-careers</ref>\n\nOf all the semiconductors in use today, [[silicon]] makes up the largest portion both by quantity and commercial value. Monocrystalline silicon is used to produce wafers used in the semiconductor and electronics industry. Second to silicon, [[gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) is the second most popular semiconductor used. Due to its higher electron mobility and saturation velocity compared to silicon, its a material of choice for high speed electronics applications. These superior properties are compelling reasons to use GaAs circuitry in mobile phones, satellite communications, microwave point-to-point links and higher frequency radar systems. Other semiconductor materials include [[germanium]], [[silicon carbide]], and [[gallium nitride]] and have various applications.\n\n==Relation to other fields==\nMaterials science evolved\u2014starting from the 1960s\u2014because it was recognized that to create, discover and design new materials, one had to approach it in a unified manner. Thus, materials science and engineering emerged at the intersection of various fields such as [[metallurgy]], [[solid state physics]], [[chemistry]], [[chemical engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]] and [[electrical engineering]].\n\nThe field is inherently [[interdisciplinary]], and the materials scientists/engineers must be aware and make use of the methods of the physicist, chemist and engineer. The field thus, maintains close relationships with these fields. Also, many physicists, chemists and engineers also find themselves working in materials science.\n\nThe overlap between physics and materials science has led to the offshoot field of ''materials physics'', which is concerned with the physical properties of materials. The approach is generally more macroscopic and applied than in [[condensed matter physics]]. See [[list of publications in physics#Materials physics|important publications in materials physics]] for more details on this field of study.\n\nThe field of materials science and engineering is important both from a scientific perspective, as well as from an engineering one. When discovering new materials, one encounters new phenomena that may not have been observed before. Hence, there is lot of science to be discovered when working with materials. Materials science also provides test for theories in condensed matter physics.\n\nMaterials are of the utmost importance for engineers, as the usage of the appropriate materials is crucial when designing systems. As a result, materials science is an increasingly important part of an engineer's education.\n\n==Emerging technologies in materials science==\n<!--\nTo add a new row to the table, insert\n\n|-\n| Emerging technology\n| Status\n| Potentially marginalized technologies\n| Potential applications\n\nand replace the placeholder with appropriate text.\n-->\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
