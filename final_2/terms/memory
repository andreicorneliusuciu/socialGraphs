Encoding allows information from the outside world to be sensed in the form of chemical and physical stimuli. Storage is the second memory process and allows for the creation of a stable, more permanent record of encoded information. Finally, the third process is the retrieval of information that has been stored.  Such information must be accessed and returned to [[consciousness]] or [[working memory]]. Depending on the type of information stored, retrieval may be effortless or it may require a more cognitively demanding search through memory.\n\nFrom an [[information processing]] perspective there are three main stages in the formation and retrieval of memory:\n* ''[[Encoding (memory)|Encoding]]'' or registration: receiving, processing and combining of received information\n* ''[[Storage (memory)|Storage]]'': creation of a permanent record of the encoded information in short term or long term memory\n* ''[[Recollection|Retrieval]]'', ''recall'' or ''recollection'': calling back the stored information in response to some cue for use in a process or activity\n\nThe loss of memory is described as [[Forgetting|forgetfulness]] or [[amnesia]].\n[[File:Memory.gif|thumb|right|320px|Overview of the forms and functions of memory in the sciences]]\n\n==Sensory memory==\n{{Main article|Sensory memory}}\nSensory memory holds sensory information less than one second after an item is perceived. The ability to look at an item and remember what it looked like with just a split second of observation, or memorization, is the example of sensory memory. It is out of cognitive control and is an automatic response. With very short presentations, participants often report that they seem to \"see\" more than they can actually report. The first experiments exploring this form of sensory memory were precisely conducted by [[George Sperling]] (1963)<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Sperling, G| year = 1963 | title = A Model for Visual Memory Tasks | journal =  hfs.sagepub.com |url=http://hfs.sagepub.com/content/5/1/19.short#cited-by  | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 19\u201331 }}</ref>  using the \"partial report paradigm\".  Subjects were presented with a grid of 12 letters, arranged into three rows of four. After a brief presentation, subjects were then played either a high, medium or low tone, cuing them which of the rows to report. Based on these partial report experiments,Sperling was able to show that the capacity of sensory memory was approximately 12 items, but that it degraded very quickly (within a few hundred milliseconds). Because this form of memory degrades so quickly, participants would see the display but be unable to report all of the items (12 in the \"whole report\" procedure) before they decayed. This type of memory cannot be prolonged via rehearsal.\n\nThree types of sensory memories exist. [[Iconic memory]] is a fast decaying store of visual information; a type of sensory memory that briefly stores an image which has been perceived for a small duration. [[Echoic memory]] is a fast decaying store of auditory information, another type of sensory memory that briefly stores sounds that have been perceived for short durations.<ref name=\"Carlson 2010\">{{cite book |author=Carlson, Neil R. |title=Psychology: the science of behavior |publisher=Allyn & Bacon |location=Boston, Mass |year=2010 |pages= |isbn=0-205-68557-9 |oclc=268547522}}</ref> [[Haptic memory]] is a type of sensory memory that represents a database for touch stimuli.\n\n==Short-term memory==\n{{Main article|Short-term memory}}\nShort-term memory is also known as working memory. Short-term memory allows recall for a period of several seconds to a minute without rehearsal. Its capacity is also very limited: [[George Armitage Miller|George A. Miller]] (1956), when working at [[Bell Labs|Bell Laboratories]], conducted experiments showing that the store of short-term memory was 7\u00b12 items (the title of his famous paper, \"[[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two|The magical number 7\u00b12]]\").

This method of remembering telephone numbers is far more effective than attempting to remember a string of 10 digits; this is because we are able to chunk the information into meaningful groups of numbers.  This may be reflected in some countries in the tendency to display telephone numbers as several chunks of two to four numbers.\n\nShort-term memory is believed to rely mostly on an acoustic code for storing information, and to a lesser extent a visual code. Conrad (1964)<ref name=\"Conrad (1964)\">{{Cite journal | author = Conrad, R. | year = 1964 | title = Acoustic Confusions in Immediate Memory | url = http://step.psy.cmu.edu/articles/Conrad64.doc | journal = British Journal of Psychology | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 75\u201384 | doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1964.tb00899.x}}</ref> found that test subjects had more difficulty recalling collections of letters that were acoustically similar (e.g. E, P, D). Confusion with recalling acoustically similar letters rather than visually similar letters implies that the letters were encoded acoustically. Conrad's (1964) study, however, deals with the encoding of written text; thus, while memory of written language may rely on acoustic components, generalisations to all forms of memory cannot be made.\n\n==Long-term memory==\n{{Main article|Long-term memory}}\n[[File:Memory-Warner-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|150px|[[Olin Levi Warner]], ''Memory'' (1896). Library of Congress [[Thomas Jefferson Building]], Washington, D.C.]]\nThe storage in sensory memory and short-term memory generally has a strictly limited capacity and duration, which means that information is not retained indefinitely. By contrast, long-term memory can store much larger quantities of information for potentially unlimited duration (sometimes a whole life span). Its capacity is immeasurable. For example, given a random seven-digit number we may remember it for only a few seconds before forgetting, suggesting it was stored in our short-term memory. On the other hand, we can remember telephone numbers for many years through repetition; this information is said to be stored in long-term memory.\n\nWhile short-term memory encodes information acoustically, long-term memory encodes it semantically: Baddeley (1966)<ref name=\"Baddeley 1966\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/14640746608400047 | author = Baddeley, A.

Long-term memory, on the other hand, is maintained by more stable and permanent changes in neural connections widely spread throughout the brain. The [[hippocampus]] is essential (for learning new information) to the consolidation of information from short-term to long-term memory, although it does not seem to store information itself. Without the hippocampus, new memories are unable to be stored into long-term memory, as learned from patient [[Henry Molaison]] after removal of both his hippocampi,<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Scoville W.B. |author2=Milner B. |title=Loss of Recent Memory After Bilateral Hippocampal Lesions |journal=Journal of Nurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry |volume=20 |pages=11\u201321 |year=1957 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC497229/pdf/jnnpsyc00285-0015.pdf |pmc=497229 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.20.1.11 |pmid=13406589}}</ref> and there will be a very short [[attention span]].

Below are several models proposed over the years by various psychologists. Controversy is involved as to whether several memory structures exist.\n\n===Atkinson\u2013Shiffrin===\n{{See also|Memory consolidation}}\n[[File:multistore model.png|right]]\nThe multi-store model (also known as [[Atkinson\u2013Shiffrin memory model]]) was first described in 1968 by [[Richard C. Atkinson|Atkinson]] and [[Richard Shiffrin|Shiffrin]].\n\nThe multi-store model has been criticised for being too simplistic. For instance, long-term memory is believed to be actually made up of multiple subcomponents, such as episodic and [[procedural memory]]. It also proposes that rehearsal is the only mechanism by which information eventually reaches long-term storage, but evidence shows us capable of remembering things without rehearsal.\n\nThe model also shows all the memory stores as being a single unit whereas research into this shows differently. For example, short-term memory can be broken up into different units such as visual information and acoustic information. In a study by Zlonoga and Gerber (1986), patient 'KF' demonstrated certain deviations from the Atkinson\u2013Shiffrin model. Patient KF was [[brain damage]]d, displaying difficulties regarding short-term memory. Recognition of sounds such as spoken numbers, letters, words and easily identifiable noises (such as doorbells and cats meowing) were all impacted. Interestingly, visual short-term memory was unaffected, suggesting a dichotomy between visual and audial memory.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=3952419 | volume=75 | issue=7 | title=A case from practice (49).

In this model, working memory consists of three basic stores: the central executive, the phonological loop and the visuo-spatial sketchpad. In 2000 this model was expanded with the multimodal episodic buffer ([[Baddeley's model of working memory]]).<ref name=\"Baddeley 2000\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01538-2 | author = Baddeley, A.D. | year = 2000 | title = The episodic buffer: a new component of working memory? | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Science | volume = 4 | issue = 11| pages = 417\u201323 | pmid=11058819}}</ref>\n\nThe central executive essentially acts as an attention sensory store. It channels information to the three component processes: the phonological loop, the visuo-spatial sketchpad, and the episodic buffer.\n\nThe phonological loop stores auditory information by silently rehearsing sounds or words in a continuous loop: the articulatory process (for example the repetition of a telephone number over and over again). A short list of data is easier to remember.\n\nThe [[visuospatial sketchpad]] stores visual and spatial information. It is engaged when performing spatial tasks (such as judging distances) or visual ones (such as counting the windows on a house or imagining images).\n\nThe episodic buffer is dedicated to linking information across domains to form integrated units of visual, spatial, and verbal information and chronological ordering (e.g., the memory of a story or a movie scene). The episodic buffer is also assumed to have links to long-term memory and semantical meaning.\n\nThe working memory model explains many practical observations, such as why it is easier to do two different tasks (one verbal and one visual) than two similar tasks (e.g., two visual), and the aforementioned word-length effect. However, the concept of a central executive as noted here has been criticised as inadequate and vague. {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Working memory is also the premise for what allows us to do everyday activities involving thought. It is the section of memory where we carry out thought processes and use them to learn and reason about topics.<ref name=\"Baddeley 2000\"/>\n\n==Types==\n\nResearchers distinguish between '''recognition''' and '''recall''' memory.  Recognition memory tasks require individuals to indicate whether they have encountered a stimulus (such as a picture or a word) before.  Recall memory tasks require participants to retrieve previously learned information.  For example, individuals might be asked  to produce a series of actions they have seen before or to say a list of words they have heard before.\n\n===By information type===\n\n'''Topographic memory''' involves the ability to orient oneself in space, to recognize and follow an itinerary, or to recognize familiar places.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.med.univ-rennes1.fr/iidris/cache/an/40/4003 |title=IIDRSI: topographic memory loss |publisher=Med.univ-rennes1.fr |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08}}</ref> Getting lost when traveling alone is an example of the failure of topographic memory.<ref name=\"Aguirre 1999\">{{cite journal |author1=Aguirre, G.K. |author2=D'Esposito, M. |title=Topographical disorientation: a synthesis and taxonomy |journal=Brain |volume=122 |issue= 9|pages=1613\u201328 |date=September 1999|pmid=10468502 |doi= 10.1093/brain/122.9.1613 |url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/122/9/1613.long}}</ref>\n\n'''Flashbulb memories''' are clear [[episodic memories]] of unique and highly emotional events.<ref>T.L.

It is sometimes called ''[[explicit memory]]'', since it consists of information that is explicitly stored and retrieved.\n\nDeclarative memory can be further sub-divided into [[semantic memory]], concerning principles and facts taken independent of context; and [[episodic memory]], concerning information specific to a particular context, such as a time and place. Semantic memory allows the encoding of abstract [[knowledge]] about the world, such as \"Paris is the capital of France\". Episodic memory, on the other hand, is used for more personal memories, such as the sensations, emotions, and personal associations of a particular place or time. Episodic memories often reflect the \"firsts\" in life such as a first kiss, first day of school or first time winning a championship. These are key events in one's life that can be remembered clearly.  [[Autobiographical memory]] - memory for particular events within one's own life - is generally viewed as either equivalent to, or a subset of, episodic memory. [[Visual memory]] is part of memory preserving some characteristics of our senses pertaining to visual experience. One is able to place in memory information that resembles objects, places, animals or people in sort of a [[mental image]]. Visual memory can result in [[priming (psychology)|priming]] and it is assumed some kind of perceptual representational system underlies this phenomenon.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n==== Procedural ====\nIn contrast, [[procedural memory]] (or ''[[implicit memory]]'') is not based on the conscious recall of information, but on [[implicit learning]]. It can best be summarized as remember how to do something. Procedural memory is primarily employed in learning [[motor skill]]s and should be considered a subset of implicit memory. It is revealed when one does better in a given task due only to repetition - no new explicit memories have been formed, but one is [[Unconscious mind|unconsciously]] accessing aspects of those previous experiences. Procedural memory involved in [[motor learning]] depends on the [[cerebellum]] and [[basal ganglia]].\n\nA characteristic of procedural memory is that the things remembered are automatically translated into actions, and thus sometimes difficult to describe. Some examples of procedural memory include the ability to ride a bike or tie shoelaces.<ref name=\"Schacter 2011\">{{cite book |author1=Schacter, Daniel L |author2=Gilbert, Daniel T |author3=Wegner, Daniel M |title= Implicit Memory and Explicit Memory |work=Psychology |publisher=Worth Publishers |location=New York |year=2010 |pages=238 |isbn=1-4292-3719-8 |oclc=755079969 }}</ref>\n\n===By temporal direction===\nAnother major way to distinguish different memory functions is whether the content to be remembered is in the past, [[retrospective memory]], or in the future, [[prospective memory]]. Thus, retrospective memory as a category includes semantic, episodic  and autobiographical memory. In contrast, prospective memory is memory for future intentions, or ''remembering to remember'' (Winograd, 1988). Prospective memory can be further broken down into event- and time-based prospective remembering. Time-based prospective memories are triggered by a time-cue, such as going to the doctor (action) at 4pm (cue). Event-based prospective memories are intentions triggered by cues, such as remembering to post a letter (action) after seeing a mailbox (cue). Cues do not need to be related to the action (as the mailbox/letter example), and lists, sticky-notes, knotted handkerchiefs, or string around the finger all exemplify cues that people use as strategies to enhance prospective memory.\n\n==Study techniques==\n\n===To assess infants===\n\nInfants do not have the language ability to report on their memories and so verbal reports cannot be used to assess very young children's memory.  Throughout the years, however, researchers have adapted and developed a number of measures for assessing both infants' recognition memory and their recall memory.  [[Habituation]] and [[operant conditioning]] techniques have been used to assess infants' recognition memory and the deferred and elicited imitation techniques have been used to assess infants' recall memory.\n\nTechniques used to assess infants' recognition memory include the following:\n* '''Visual paired comparison procedure (relies on habituation)''': infants are first presented with pairs of visual stimuli, such as two black-and-white photos of human faces, for a fixed amount of time; then, after being familiarized with the two photos, they are presented with the \"familiar\" photo and a new photo.  The time spent looking at each photo is recorded.  Looking longer at the new photo indicates that they remember the \"familiar\" one.  Studies using this procedure have found that 5- to 6-month-olds can retain information for as long as fourteen days.<ref name=\"Fagan 1974\">{{cite journal |author=Fagan, J.F. |title=Infant recognition memory: the effects of length of familiarization and type of discrimination task |journal=Child Dev |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=351\u2013356 |date=June 1974 |pmid=4837713 |url=http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1127955?uid=3738032&uid=2&uid=4&sid=21102576869793}}</ref>\n* '''Operant conditioning technique''': infants are placed in a crib and a ribbon that is connected to a mobile overhead is tied to one of their feet.  Infants notice that when they kick their foot the mobile moves \u2013 the rate of kicking increases dramatically within minutes.  Studies using this technique have revealed that infants' memory substantially improves over the first 18-months.  Whereas 2- to 3-month-olds can retain an operant response (such as activating the mobile by kicking their foot) for a week, 6-month-olds can retain it for two weeks, and 18-month-olds can retain a similar operant response for as long as 13 weeks.<ref name=\"Rovee-Collier 1999\">{{cite journal|last1=Rovee-Collier|first1=Carolyn|title=The Development of Infant Memory|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=8| issue=3|year=1999| pages=80\u201385| issn=0963-7214|doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00019 |url=http://bernard.pitzer.edu/~dmoore/psych199s03articles/R-Collier_memory.pdf}}</ref><ref name=\"Rovee-Collier 1993\">{{cite book |author=Rovee-Collier, C.K.,  Bhatt, R.

This occurs in the storage stage of memory, after the information has been stored and before it is retrieved. This can happen in sensory, short-term, and long-term storage. It follows a general pattern where the information is rapidly forgotten during the first couple of days or years, followed by small losses in later days or years.\n* '''Absentmindedness''' \u2013 Memory failure due to the lack of attention. Attention plays a key role in storing information into long-term memory; without proper attention, the information might not be stored, making it impossible to be retrieved later.\n\n==Physiology==\nBrain areas involved in the [[neuroanatomy of memory]] such as the [[hippocampus]], the [[amygdala]], the [[striatum]], or the [[mammillary bodies]] are thought to be involved in specific types of memory. For example, the hippocampus is believed to be involved in spatial learning and [[declarative learning]], while the amygdala is thought to be involved in [[Emotion and memory|emotional memory]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=LaBar K.S. |author2=Cabeza R. |title=Cognitive neuroscience of emotional memory |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=7 |pages=54\u201364 |year=2006 |doi=10.1038/nrn1825 |issue=1}}</ref> Damage to certain areas in patients and animal models and subsequent memory deficits is a primary source of information. However, rather than implicating a specific area, it could be that damage to adjacent areas, or to a pathway traveling through the area is actually responsible for the observed deficit. Further, it is not sufficient to describe memory, and its counterpart, [[learning]], as solely dependent on specific brain regions. Learning and memory are attributed to changes in neuronal [[synapse]]s, thought to be mediated by [[long-term potentiation]] and [[long-term depression]].\n\nIn general, the more emotionally charged an event or experience is, the better it is remembered; this phenomenon is known as the '''memory enhancement effect'''.  Patients with amygdala damage, however, do not show a memory enhancement effect.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Adolphs R. |author2=Cahill L. |author3=Schul R. |author4=Babinsky R. |title=Impaired declarative memory for emotional material following bilateral amygdala damage in humans |journal=Learning & Memory |volume=4 |pages=291\u2013300 |year=1997 |doi=10.1101/lm.4.3.291}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Cahill L.|author2=Babinsky R.|author3=Markowitsch H.J.|author4=McGaugh J.L.|authorlink3=Hans Markowitsch| title=The amygdala and emotional memory |journal=Nature |volume=377 |pages=295\u2013296 |year=1995 |doi=10.1038/377295a0 |issue=6547}}</ref>\n\nHebb distinguished between short-term and long-term memory. He postulated that any memory that stayed in short-term storage for a long enough time would be consolidated into a long-term memory. Later research showed this to be false. Research has shown that direct injections of [[cortisol]] or [[epinephrine]] help the storage of recent experiences. This is also true for stimulation of the amygdala. This proves that excitement enhances memory by the stimulation of hormones that affect the amygdala. Excessive or prolonged stress (with prolonged cortisol) may hurt memory storage. Patients with amygdalar damage are no more likely to remember emotionally charged words than nonemotionally charged ones. The hippocampus is important for explicit memory. The hippocampus is also important for memory consolidation. The hippocampus receives input from different parts of the cortex and sends its output out to different parts of the brain also. The input comes from secondary and tertiary sensory areas that have processed the information a lot already. Hippocampal damage may also cause [[memory loss]] and problems with memory storage.<ref>{{cite book    | last =Kalat    | first =J. W.    | title =Biological psychology (7th ed.)   | publisher = Wadsworth Publishing   | year =2001   | location =Belmont, CA }}</ref> This memory loss includes, retrograde amnesia which is the loss of memory for events that occurred shortly before the time of brain damage.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Cognitive neuroscience==\nCognitive neuroscientists consider memory as the retention, reactivation, and reconstruction of the experience-independent internal representation. The term of internal [[Mental representation|representation]] implies that such definition of memory contains two components: the expression of memory at the behavioral or conscious level, and the underpinning physical neural changes (Dudai 2007). The latter component is also called [[engram (neuropsychology)|engram]] or memory traces (Semon 1904). Some neuroscientists and psychologists mistakenly equate the concept of engram and memory, broadly conceiving all persisting after-effects of experiences as memory; others argue against this notion that memory does not exist until it is revealed in behavior or thought (Moscovitch 2007).\n\nOne question that is crucial in cognitive neuroscience is how information and mental experiences are coded and represented in the brain. Scientists have gained much knowledge about the neuronal codes from the studies of plasticity, but most of such research has been focused on simple learning in simple neuronal circuits; it is considerably less clear about the neuronal changes involved in more complex examples of memory, particularly declarative memory that requires the storage of facts and events (Byrne 2007). [[Convergence-divergence zone]]s might be the neural networks where memories are stored and retrieved. Considering that there are several kinds of memory, depending on types of represented knowledge, underlying mechanisms, processes functions and modes of acquisition, it is likely that different brain areas support different memory systems and that they are in mutual relationships in neuronal networks: \"components of memory representation are distributed widely across different parts of the brain as mediated by multiple neocortical circuits.\" <ref name=\"crossingdialogues.com\">Ofengenden, Tzofit (2014) Memory formation and belief. Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences, 7(2):34-44 http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A14-03.pdf</ref>\n* [[Encoding (memory)|Encoding]]. Encoding of [[working memory]] involves the spiking of individual neurons induced by sensory input, which persists even after the sensory input disappears (Jensen and Lisman 2005; Fransen et al. 2002). Encoding of [[episodic memory]] involves persistent changes in molecular structures that alter [[synaptic transmission]] between neurons. Examples of such structural changes include [[long-term potentiation]] (LTP) or [[spike-timing-dependent plasticity]] (STDP).  The persistent spiking in working memory can enhance the synaptic and cellular changes in the encoding of episodic memory (Jensen and Lisman 2005).\n* Working memory. Recent functional imaging studies detected working memory signals in both [[medial temporal lobe]] (MTL), a brain area strongly associated with [[long-term memory]], and [[prefrontal cortex]] (Ranganath et al. 2005), suggesting a strong relationship between working memory and long-term memory. However, the substantially more working memory signals seen in the prefrontal lobe suggest that this area play a more important role in working memory than MTL (Suzuki 2007).\n* [[Memory consolidation|Consolidation]] and [[reconsolidation]]. [[Short-term memory]] (STM) is temporary and subject to disruption, while long-term memory (LTM), once consolidated, is persistent and stable. Consolidation of STM into LTM at the molecular level presumably involves two processes: synaptic consolidation and system consolidation. The former involves a protein synthesis process in the medial temporal lobe (MTL), whereas the latter transforms the MTL-dependent memory into an MTL-independent memory over months to years (Ledoux 2007). In recent years, such traditional consolidation dogma has been re-evaluated as a result of the studies on reconsolidation. These studies showed that prevention after [[recall (memory)|retrieval]] affects subsequent retrieval of the memory (Sara 2000). New studies have shown that post-retrieval treatment with protein synthesis inhibitors and many other compounds can lead to an amnestic state (Nadel et al. 2000b; Alberini 2005; Dudai 2006).  These findings on reconsolidation fit with the behavioral evidence that retrieved memory is not a carbon copy of the initial experiences, and memories are updated during retrieval.\n\n==Genetics==\nStudy of the genetics of human memory is in its infancy. A notable initial success was the association of [[Apolipoprotein E|APOE]] with memory dysfunction in [[Alzheimer's Disease]]. The search for genes associated with normally varying memory continues.

Those randomly assigned to the stress test group had a hand immersed in ice cold water (the reputable SECPT or 'Socially Evaluated Cold Pressor Test') for up to three minutes, while being monitored and videotaped.   Both the stress and control groups were then presented with 32 words to memorize.  Twenty-four hours later, both groups were tested to see how many words they could remember (free recall) as well as how many they could recognize from a larger list of words (recognition performance). The results showed a clear impairment of memory performance in the stress test group, who recalled 30% fewer words than the control group.  The researchers suggest that stress experienced during learning distracts people by diverting their attention during the memory encoding process.\n\nHowever, memory performance can be enhanced when material is linked to the learning context, even when learning occurs under stress.  A separate study by cognitive psychologists Schwabe and Wolf shows that when retention testing is done in a context similar to or congruent with the original learning task (i.e., in the same room), memory impairment and the detrimental effects of stress on learning can be attenuated.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schwabe|first1=L.|last2=Wolf|first2=O.T.|title=The context counts: Congruent learning and testing environments prevent memory retrieval impairment following stress|journal=Affective & Behavioral Neuroscience|year=2009|volume=9|issue=3|pages=229\u2013236|doi=10.3758/CABN.9.3.229}}</ref> Seventy-two healthy female and male university students, randomly assigned to the SECPT stress test or to a control group, were asked to remember the locations of 15 pairs of picture cards \u2013 a computerized version of the card game \"Concentration\" or \"Memory\".

The memory performance of subjects who experienced stress during the object-location task decreased significantly when they were tested in an unfamiliar room without the vanilla scent (an incongruent context);  however, the memory performance of stressed subjects showed no impairment when they were tested in the original room with the vanilla scent (a congruent context).   All participants in the experiment, both stressed and unstressed, performed faster when the learning and retrieval contexts were similar.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schwabe|first1=L.|last2=Bohringer|first2=A.|last3=Wolf|first3=O.T.|title=Stress disrupts context-dependent memory|journal=Learning and Memory|year=2009|volume=16|issue=2|pages=110\u2013113|doi=10.1101/lm.1257509}}</ref>\n\nThis research on the effects of stress on memory may have practical implications for education, for eyewitness testimony and for psychotherapy:  students may perform better when tested in their regular classroom rather than an exam room, eyewitnesses may recall details better at the scene of an event than in a courtroom, and persons suffering from post-traumatic stress may improve when helped to situate their memories of a traumatic event in an appropriate context.\n\nStressful life experiences may be a cause of memory loss as a person ages. Glucocorticoids that are released during stress damage neurons that are located in the hippocampal region of the brain. Therefore, the more stressful situations that someone encounters, the more susceptible they are to memory loss later on. The CA1 neurons found in the hippocampus are destroyed due to glucocorticoids decreasing the release of glucose and the reuptake of glutamate. This high level of extracellular glutamate allow calcium to enter NMDA receptors which in return kills neurons. Stressful life experiences can also cause repression of memories where a person moves an unbearable memory to the unconscious mind.<ref name=\":0\" /> This directly relates to traumatic events in one's past such as kidnappings, being prisoners of war or sexual abuse as a child.\n\nThe more long term the exposure to stress is, the more impact it may have. However, short term exposure to stress also causes impairment in memory by interfering with the function of the hippocampus. Research shows that subjects placed in a stressful situation for a short amount of time still have blood glucocorticoid levels that have increased drastically when measured after the exposure is completed. When subjects are asked to complete a learning task after short term exposure they have often difficulties. Prenatal stress also hinders the ability to learn and memorize by disrupting the development of the hippocampus and can lead to unestablished long term potentiation in the offspring of severely stressed parents. Although the stress is applied prenatally, the offspring show increased levels of glucocorticoids when they are subjected to stress later on in life.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=N.|year=2013|title=Physiology of Behavior, eleventh edition|publisher=Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson}}</ref>\n\n==Sleep==\n\nMaking memories occurs through a three-step process, which can be enhanced by [[sleep]]. The three steps are as follows:\n# Acquisition which is the process of storage and retrieval of new information in memory\n# [[Memory consolidation|Consolidation]]\n# [[Recall (memory)|Recall]]\nSleep does not affect acquisition or recall while one is awake. Therefore, sleep has the greatest effect on memory consolidation. During sleep, the neural connections in the brain are strengthened. This enhances the brain's abilities to stabilize and retain memories. There have been several studies which show that sleep improves the retention of memory, as memories are enhanced through active consolidation. System consolidation takes place during slow-wave sleep (SWS).<ref name=\"Sleep Deprivation and Memory Loss\">{{cite web|last1=Karriem-Norwood|first1=Varnada|title=Sleep Deprivation and Memory Loss|url=http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-deprivation-effects-on-memory|website=Web MD|publisher=Web MD LLC|accessdate=November 20, 2014}}</ref> This process implicates that memories are reactivated during sleep, but that the process doesn't enhance every memory.  It also implicates that qualitative changes are made to the memories when they are transferred to long-term store during sleep. When you are sleeping, the hippocampus replays the events of the day for the neocortex. The neocortex then reviews and processes memories, which moves them into long-term memory. When you do not get enough sleep it makes it more difficult to learn as these neural connections are not as strong, resulting in a lower retention rate of memories. Sleep deprivation makes it harder to focus, resulting in inefficient learning.<ref name=\"Sleep Deprivation and Memory Loss\"/> Furthermore, some studies have shown that sleep deprivation can lead to false memories as the memories are not properly transferred to long-term memory.  Therefore, it is important to get the proper amount of sleep so that memory can function at the highest level.\nOne of the primary functions of sleep is thought to be the improvement of the consolidation of information, as several studies have demonstrated that memory depends on getting sufficient sleep between training and test.<ref name=\"Ellenbogen 2006\">{{cite journal |author1=Ellenbogen, J.M. |author2=Hulbert, J.C. |author3=Stickgold, R. |author4=Dinges, D.F. |author5=Thompson-Schill, S.L. |title=Interfering with theories of sleep and memory: sleep, declarative memory, and associative interference |journal=Curr.

Since the future is not an exact repetition of the past, simulation of future episodes requires a complex system that can draw on the past in a manner that flexibly extracts and recombines elements of previous experiences - a constructive rather than a reproductive system.\" <ref name=\"crossingdialogues.com\"/> People can construct their memories when they encode them and/or when they recall them.  To illustrate, consider a classic study conducted by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer (1974)<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Loftus EF, Palmer JC|title=Reconstruction of automobile destruction: An example of the interaction between language and memory |journal=Journal of Verbal Learning & Verbal Behavior |volume=13 |pages=585\u2013589 |year=1974 |doi=10.1016/s0022-5371(74)80011-3}}</ref> in which people were instructed to watch a film of a traffic accident and then asked about what they saw.  The researchers found that the people who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they ''smashed'' into each other?\" gave higher estimates than those who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they ''hit'' each other?\"  Furthermore, when asked a week later whether they have seen broken glass in the film, those who had been asked the question with ''smashed'' were twice more likely to report that they have seen broken glass than those who had been asked the question with ''hit''.  There was no broken glass depicted in the film.  Thus, the wording of the questions distorted viewers' memories of the event.  Importantly, the wording of the question led people to construct different memories of the event \u2013 those who were asked the question with ''smashed'' recalled a more serious car accident than they had actually seen.  The findings of this experiment were replicated around the world, and researchers consistently demonstrated that when people were provided with misleading information they tended to misremember, a phenomenon known as the [[misinformation effect]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Loftus GR |title=When a lie becomes memory's truth: Memory distortion after exposure to misinformation |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=1 |pages=121\u2013123 |year=1992 |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.ep10769035}}</ref>\n\nInterestingly, research has revealed that asking individuals to repeatedly imagine actions that they have never performed or events that they have never experienced could result in false memories.  For instance, Goff and Roediger<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Goff LM, Roediger HL|title=Imagination inflation for action events: Repeated imaginings lead to illusory recollections |journal=Memory and Cognition |volume=26 |pages=20\u201333 |year=1998 |doi=10.3758/bf03211367}}</ref> (1998) asked participants to imagine that they performed an act (e.g., break a toothpick) and then later asked them whether they had done such a thing.  Findings revealed that those participants who repeatedly imagined performing such an act were more likely to think that they had actually performed that act during the first session of the experiment.  Similarly, Garry and her colleagues (1996)<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Garry M, Manning CG, Loftus EF, Sherman SJ |title=Imagination inflation: Imagining a childhood event inflates confidence that it occurred |journal=Psychonomic Bulletin & Review |volume=3 |pages=208\u2013214 |year=1996 |doi=10.3758/bf03212420}}</ref> asked college students to report how certain they were that they experienced a number of events as children (e.g., broke a window with their hand) and then two weeks later asked them to imagine four of those events.  The researchers found that one-fourth of the students asked to imagine the four events reported that they had actually experienced such events as children.  That is, when asked to imagine the events they were more confident that they experienced the events.\n\nResearch reported in 2013 revealed that it is possible to artificially stimulate prior memories and artificially implant false memories in mice. Using [[optogenetics]], a team of RIKEN-MIT scientists caused the mice to incorrectly associate a benign environment with a prior unpleasant experience from different surroundings. Some scientists believe that the study may have implications in studying false memory formation in humans, and in treating PTSD and [[schizophrenia]].<ref name=BBC20130725>{{cite news |title=Scientists can implant false memories into mice |first=Melissa |last=Hogenboom |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23447600 |newspaper=BBC News |date=July 25, 2013 |accessdate=July 26, 2013}} \u25cf [http://www.ted.com/talks/steve_ramirez_and_xu_liu_a_mouse_a_laser_beam_a_manipulated_memory.html \"A mouse.

This study examined 17 subjects, (average age 53) with normal memory performance.\nEight subjects were asked to follow a \"brain healthy\" diet, relaxation, physical, and mental exercise (brain teasers and verbal memory training techniques). After 14 days, they showed greater word fluency (not memory) compared to their baseline performance. No long term follow up was conducted, it is therefore unclear if this intervention has lasting effects on memory.<ref name=\"Small 2006\">{{cite journal |author1=Small, G.W. |author2=Silverman, D.H. |author3=Siddarth, P. |title=Effects of a 14-day healthy longevity lifestyle program on cognition and brain function |journal=Am J Geriatr Psychiatry |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=538\u201345 |date=June 2006 |pmid=16731723 |doi=10.1097/01.JGP.0000219279.72210.ca |url=|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nThere are a loosely associated group of mnemonic principles and techniques that can be used to vastly improve memory known as the [[art of memory]].\n\nThe [[International Longevity Center]] released in 2001 a report<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilcusa.org/_lib/pdf/isoa.pdf|format=PDF|title=International Longevity Center report on memory|accessdate=1 September 2008}}</ref> which includes in pages 14\u201316 recommendations for keeping the mind in good functionality until advanced age. Some of the recommendations are to stay intellectually active through learning, training or reading, to keep physically active so to promote blood circulation to the brain, to socialize, to reduce stress, to keep sleep time regular, to avoid depression or emotional instability and to observe good nutrition.\n\n[[Memorization]] is a method of learning that allows an individual to recall information verbatim. [[Rote learning]] is the method most often used. Methods of memorizing things have been the subject of much discussion over the years with some writers, such as [[Cosmos Rossellius]] using visual [[alphabets]]. The [[spacing effect]] shows that an individual is more likely to remember a list of items when rehearsal is spaced over an extended period of time. In contrast to this is [[Cram school|cramming]]: an intensive memorization in a short period of time. Also relevant is the [[Zeigarnik effect]] which states that people remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed ones. The so-called [[Method of loci]] uses spatial memory to memorize non-spatial information.<ref>Henrik Olsson, Leo Poom and Anne Treisman Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America , Vol. 102, No. 24 (Jun. 14, 2005), pp. 8776\u20138780</ref>\n\n===Levels of processing===\n{{Main article|Levels-of-processing effect}}\nCraik and Lockhart (1972) proposed that it is the method and depth of processing that affects how an experience is stored in memory, rather than rehearsal.\n\n* '''Organization''': Mandler (1967) gave participants a pack of word cards and asked them to sort them into any number of piles using any system of categorisation they liked. When they were later asked to recall as many of the words as they could, those who used more categories remembered more words. This study suggested that the  organization of memory is one of its central aspects (Mandler, 2011).\n* '''Distinctiveness''': Eysenck and Eysenck (1980) asked participants to say words in a distinctive way, e.g. spell the words out loud. Such participants recalled the words better than those who simply read them off a list.\n* '''Effort''': Tyler et al. (1979) had participants solve a series of anagrams, some easy (FAHTER) and some difficult (HREFAT). The participants recalled the difficult anagrams better, presumably because they put more effort into them.\n* '''Elaboration''': Palmere et al. (1983) gave participants descriptive paragraphs of a fictitious African nation. There were some short paragraphs and some with extra sentences elaborating the main idea. Recall was higher for the ideas in the elaborated paragraphs.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Adaptive memory]]\n* [[False memory]]\n* [[Intermediate-term memory]]\n* [[Method of loci]]\n* [[Mnemonic major system]]\n* [[Politics of memory]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite journal | author = Alberini C.M. | year = 2005 | title = Mechanisms of memory stabilization: are consolidation and reconsolidation similar or distinct processes? | url = | journal = Trends in Neuroscience | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 51\u201356 | doi=10.1016/j.tins.2004.11.001}}\n* Asimov, Isaac (1979).
