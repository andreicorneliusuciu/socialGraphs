This is the physical [[wire]] or other signaling medium connecting the user's telephone apparatus to the [[telecommunications]] network, and usually also implies a single [[telephone number]] for [[invoice|billing]] purposes reserved for that user. Telephone lines are used to deliver [[landline]] telephone service and [[Digital subscriber line]] (DSL) phone cable service to the premises. Telephone overhead lines are connected to the [[public switched telephone network]].\n\n== United States ==\nIn 1878, the [[Bell System|Bell Telephone Company]] began to use two-wire circuits (called the [[local loop]]) from each user's telephone to [[Telephone exchange|end office]]s which performed any necessary electrical switching to allow voice signals to be transmitted to more distant telephones.\n\nThese wires were typically [[copper]], although [[aluminium]] has also been used, and were carried in [[balanced pair]]s of open wire, separated by about 25&nbsp;cm (10\") on [[utility pole|poles]] above the ground, and later as [[twisted pair]] cables. Modern lines may run underground, and may carry analog or digital signals to the exchange, or may have [[Subscriber Loop Carrier|a device that converts]] the [[analog signal]] to digital for [[transmission (telecom)|transmission]] on a [[carrier system]].\n\nOften the customer end of that wire pair is connected to a [[data access arrangement]];\nthe telephone company end of that wire pair is connected to a [[telephone hybrid]].\n\nIn most cases, two copper wires ([[tip and ring]]) for each telephone line run from a home or other small building to a local [[telephone exchange]].  There is a central [[junction box]] for the building where the wires that go to telephone jacks throughout the building and wires that go to the exchange meet and can be connected in different configurations depending upon the subscribed telephone service.  The wires between the junction box and the exchange are known as the [[local loop]], and the network of wires going to an exchange, the [[access network]].\n\nThe vast majority of houses in the U.S. are wired with 6-position [[modular connector|modular jacks]] with four [[electrical conductor|conductors]] wired to the house's junction box with copper wires.  Those wires may be connected back to two telephone overhead lines at the local [[telephone exchange]], thus making those jacks [[RJ11, RJ14, RJ25|RJ14]] jacks. More often, only two of the wires are connected to the exchange as one telephone line, and the others are unconnected.  In that case, the jacks in the house are [[RJ11, RJ14, RJ25|RJ11]].\n\nOlder houses often have 4-conductor telephone station cable in the walls color coded with Bell System colors: red, green, yellow, black as 2-pairs of 22 AWG (0.33&nbsp;mm\u00b2) solid copper; \"line 1\" uses the red/green pair and \"line 2\" uses the yellow/black pair.\nInside the walls of the house\u2014between the house's outside junction box and the interior [[wall jack]]s\u2014the most common telephone cable in new houses is [[Category 5 cable]]\u20144 pairs of 24 AWG (0.205&nbsp;mm\u00b2) solid copper.<ref>\nPublic Service Commission of Wisconsin.\n[http://www.wwt.net/pdf/telephone-wiring.pdf \"Testing, Repairing & Installing Home Telephone Wiring\"].\n</ref>\n\nInside large buildings, and in the outdoor cables that run to the telephone company [[point of presence|POP]], many telephone lines are bundled together in a single cable using the [[25-pair color code]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n<!-- Is [[BS 6312]] used in the UK ? -->\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Telephone Line}}\n[[Category:Local loop]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications equipment|Line]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications infrastructure]]"}]}}}}
