It may be constructed of conventional military explosives, such as an artillery round, attached to a detonating mechanism. IEDs are commonly used as '''roadside bombs'''.\n\nIEDs are generally seen in heavy [[terrorist]] actions or in [[unconventional warfare]] by [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]]s or [[commando]] forces in a [[theater (warfare)|theater of operations]]. In the second [[Iraq War]], IEDs were used extensively against US-led invasion forces and by the end of 2007 they had become responsible for approximately 63% of coalition deaths in Iraq.<ref name=\"icasualties\" /> They are also used in Afghanistan by insurgent groups, and have caused over 66% of coalition casualties in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|2001\u2013present Afghanistan War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.mytelus.com/telusen/portal/NewsChannel.aspx?CatID=National&ArticleID=news/capfeed/national/n102529A.xml |title=home.mytelus.com |publisher=home.mytelus.com |accessdate=2012-05-11}}</ref>\n\nIEDs were also used extensively by cadres of the rebel [[Tamil Tiger]] (LTTE) organization against military targets in [[Sri Lanka]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/srilanka/globalthreat.html |title=Suicide Terrorism: A Global Threat |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=2009-10-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/04/13/stories/2006041304711500.htm |title=13 killed in blasts, arson in Sri Lanka |publisher=Hindu.com |date=2006-04-13 |accessdate=2009-10-18 |location=Chennai, India}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Inspection of IED (Improvised Explosive Device) by X-ray.jpg|upright=1.6|thumb|A [[portable X-ray|portable]] [[X-ray generator]] and a portable [[flat panel detector]] are used to inspect a suspicious carrying case.]]\nThe term comes from the [[British Army]] in the 1970s, after the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) used bombs made from agricultural [[fertilizer]] and [[Semtex]] smuggled from [[Libya]] to make highly effective [[boobytrap]] devices or remote-controlled bombs.\n\nAn IED is a bomb fabricated in an improvised manner incorporating destructive, lethal, noxious, [[pyrotechnic]], or [[incendiary device|incendiary]] [[chemical industry|chemicals]] and designed to destroy or incapacitate personnel or vehicles. In some cases, IEDs are used to distract, disrupt, or delay an opposing force, facilitating another type of attack.<ref name=\"AAP-6\">{{cite book | title = NATO Glossary of Terms and Definitions (AAP-6) | year = 2010 | publisher = [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] | url = http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/doctrine/other/aap6.pdf | format = PDF | page = 2-1-2}}</ref> IEDs may incorporate [[military]] or commercially sourced explosives, and often combine both types, or they may otherwise be made with homemade [[explosives]] (HME).\n\nAn IED has five components: a switch (activator), an initiator (fuse), container (body), charge (explosive), and a power source (battery). An IED designed for use against armoured targets such as personnel carriers or tanks will be designed for armour penetration, by using a [[shaped charge]] that creates an [[explosively formed penetrator]].  IEDs are extremely diverse in design and may contain many types of initiators, detonators, penetrators, and explosive loads.\n\nAntipersonnel IEDs typically also contain fragmentation-generating objects such as nails, ball bearings or even small rocks to cause wounds at greater distances than blast pressure alone could. IEDs are triggered by various methods, including remote control, infrared or magnetic triggers, pressure-sensitive bars or trip wires (victim-operated). In some cases, multiple IEDs are wired together in a [[daisy chain (electrical engineering)|daisy chain]] to attack a convoy of vehicles spread out along a roadway.\n\nIEDs made by inexperienced designers or with substandard materials may fail to [[detonation|detonate]], and in some cases, they actually detonate on either the maker or the emplacer of the device. Some groups, however, have been known to produce sophisticated devices constructed with components scavenged from conventional [[munition]]s and standard consumer [[electronics]] components, such as [[mobile phone]]s, washing machine timers, pagers, or garage door openers. The sophistication of an IED depends on the training of the designer and the tools and materials available.\n\nIEDs may use artillery shells or conventional [[explosive material|high-explosive]] charges as their explosive load as well as homemade explosives. However, the threat exists that toxic [[chemical warfare|chemical]], [[biological warfare|biological]], or radioactive ([[dirty bomb]]) material may be added to a device, thereby creating other life-threatening effects beyond the shrapnel, concussive blasts and fire normally associated with bombs. [[Chlorine]] liquid has been [[Chlorine bombings in Iraq|added to IEDs in Iraq]], producing clouds of chlorine gas.\n\nA '''vehicle-borne IED''', or '''VBIED''', is a military term for a [[car bomb]] or truck bomb but can be any type of transportation such as a bicycle, motorcycle, donkey ({{vanchor|DBIED}}<ref>{{citation|title=Afghanistan|series=Country Travel Guide Series|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|first=Paul|last=Clammer|year=2007|p=171|isbn=9781740596428|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PjhP76JaVgkC&pg=PA71}}\n</ref>), etc. They are typically employed by [[insurgent]]s, and can carry a relatively large payload. They can also be detonated from a remote location. VBIEDs can create additional shrapnel through the destruction of the vehicle itself and use vehicle fuel as an [[incendiary weapon]]. The act of a person's being in this vehicle and detonating it is known as an SVBIED [[suicide]].\n\nOf increasing popularity among insurgent forces in Iraq is the house-borne IED, or HBIED from the common military practice of clearing houses; insurgents rig an entire house to detonate and collapse shortly after a clearing squad has entered.\n\n==Historical use==\nThe [[Fougasse (weapon)|fougasse]] was improvised for centuries, eventually inspiring factory-made [[land mine]]s. [[Ernst J\u00fcnger]] mentions in his war memoir the systematic use of IEDs and [[booby trap]]s to cover the retreat of German troops at the [[Somme (department)|Somme]] region during the [[First World War]].

Among those supplies were many types of [[anti-tank mine]]s. The insurgents often removed the explosives from several foreign anti-tank mines, and combined the explosives in tin cooking-oil cans for a more powerful blast. By combining the explosives from several mines and placing them in tin cans, the insurgents made them more powerful, but sometimes also easier to detect by Soviet sappers using [[mine detector]]s. After an IED was detonated, the insurgents often used direct-fire weapons such as machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades to continue the attack.\n\nAfghan insurgents operating far from the border with [[Pakistan]] did not have a ready supply of foreign anti-tank mines. They preferred to make IEDs from Soviet unexploded ordnance. The devices were rarely triggered by pressure fuses. They were almost always remotely detonated. Since the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|2001 invasion of Afghanistan]], the [[Taliban]] and its supporters have used IEDs against [[NATO]] and Afghan military and civilian vehicles. This has become the most common method of attack against NATO forces, with IED attacks increasing consistently year on year.\n\nAccording to a report by the [[Homeland Security Market Research]] in the USA, the number of IEDs used in Afghanistan had increased by 400 percent since 2007 and the number of troops killed by them by 400 percent, and those wounded by 700 percent.

That is to say more than in the \"normal fights\" (1027 dead, 34%).\nInsurgents now use the bombs to target not only invading coalition vehicles but Iraqi police as well.\n\nCommon locations for placing these bombs on the ground include animal [[Carrion|carcasses]], [[soft drink can]]s, and [[box]]es.  Typically they explode underneath or to the side of the vehicle to cause the maximum amount of damage; however, as [[vehicle armor]] was improved on military vehicles, insurgents began placing IEDs in elevated positions such as on [[traffic sign|road signs]], utility poles, or [[tree]]s, in order to hit less protected areas.\n\nIEDs in Iraq may be made with [[artillery]] or [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] [[projectile|shell]]s or with varying amounts of bulk or homemade [[explosive]]s.  Early during the Iraq war, the bulk explosives were often obtained from stored munitions bunkers to include stripping landmines of their explosives.\n\nDespite the increased [[armor]], IEDs have been killing military personnel and civilians with greater frequency.

They used [[barrack buster]] mortars and remote controlled IEDs. Members of the IRA developed and counter-developed devices and tactics. IRA bombs became highly sophisticated, featuring [[anti-handling device]]s such as a [[mercury switch|mercury tilt switch]] or [[microswitch]]es. These devices would [[detonate]] the bomb if it was moved in any way. Typically, the safety-arming device used was a clockwork [[Memopark timer]], which armed the bomb up to 60 minutes after it was placed<ref>Parry, Gareth; Pallister, David. ''Timer clue to Brighton bombing'', [[The Guardian]]; 10 May 10, 1986</ref> by completing an electrical circuit supplying power to the anti-handling device. Depending on the particular design (e.g., [[boobytrap]]ped [[briefcase]] or [[car bomb]]) an independent electrical circuit supplied power to a conventional timer set for the intended time delay, e.g. 40 minutes. However, some electronic delays developed by IRA technicians could be set to accurately detonate a bomb weeks after it was hidden, which is what happened in the [[Brighton hotel bombing|Brighton hotel bomb attack]] of 1984. Initially, bombs were detonated either by timer or by simple command wire. Later, bombs could be detonated by radio control. Initially, simple servos from [[radio-controlled aircraft]] were used to close the electrical circuit and supply power to the detonator. After the British developed jammers, IRA technicians introduced devices that required a sequence of pulsed radio codes to arm and detonate them. These were harder to jam.\n\nRoadside bombs were extensively used by the IRA. Typically, a roadside bomb was placed in a drain or culvert along a rural road and detonated by remote control when British security forces vehicles were passing. As a result of the use of these bombs, the British military stopped transport by road in areas such as South Armagh, and used [[helicopter]] transport instead to avoid the danger.\n\nMost IEDs used commercial or homemade explosives, although the use of [[Semtex]]-H smuggled in from [[Libya]] in the 1980s was also common from the mid-1980s onward. [[Bomb Disposal]] teams from [[321 EOD]] manned by [[Ammunition Technicians]] were deployed in those areas to deal with the IED threat. The IRA also used secondary devices to catch British reinforcements sent in after an initial blast as occurred in the [[Warrenpoint Ambush]]. Between 1970 and 2005, the IRA detonated 19,000 improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in the Northern Ireland and Britain, an average of one every 17 hours for three and a half decades, arguably making it \"the biggest terrorist bombing campaign in history\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digital.ipcprintservices.com/display_article.php?id=177490|title=IRA TECHNOLOGY|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1970s, at the height of the IRA campaign, the [[British Army]] unit tasked with rendering safe IEDs, 321 EOD, sustained significant casualties while engaged in bomb disposal operations. This mortality rate was far higher than other high risk occupations such as deep sea diving, and a careful review was made of how men were selected for [[Explosive Ordnance Disposal|EOD]] operations. The review recommended bringing in [[psychometric]] testing of soldiers to ensure those chosen had the correct mental preparation for high risk bomb disposal duties.\n\nThe IRA came up with ever more sophisticated designs and deployments of IEDs. [[Booby Trap]] or Victim Operated IEDs (VOIEDs), became commonplace. The IRA engaged in an ongoing battle to gain the upper hand in electronic warfare with remote controlled devices. The rapid changes in development led 321 EOD to employ specialists from [[Defence Evaluation and Research Agency|DERA]] (now [[Dstl]], an agency of the MOD), the [[Royal Signals]], and [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Military Intelligence]]. This approach by the British army to fighting the IRA in Northern Ireland led to the development and use of most of the modern weapons, equipment and techniques now used by EOD Operators throughout the rest of the world today.\n\nThe [[bomb disposal]] operations were led by [[Ammunition Technician]]s and [[Ammunition Technical Officer]]s from 321 EOD, and were trained at the [[Felix Centre]] at the [[Army School of Ammunition]].\n\n===Lebanon===\nThe [[Lebanese National Resistance Front]], the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]], other resistance groups in Lebanon, and later [[Hezbollah]], made extensive use of IEDs to resist [[Israel]]i forces after Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982. Israel withdrew from Beirut, Northern Lebanon, and Mount Lebanon in 1985, whilst maintaining its occupation of Southern Lebanon. Hezbollah frequently used IEDs to attack Israeli military forces in this area up until the Israeli withdrawal, and the liberation of Lebanon in May 2000.\n\nOne such bomb killed Israeli [[Brigadier General]] Erez Gerstein<ref>{{cite book|title=The Essence of Longing: General Erez Gerstein and the War in Lebanon|publisher=Miskal&nbsp;\u2014 Yedioth Ahronoth Books and Chemed Books|date=May 2007|first=Ehud|last=Eiran|language=he}}</ref> on February 28, 1999, the highest-ranking Israeli to die in Lebanon since [[Yekutiel Adam]]'s death in 1982.\n\nAlso in the [[2006 Lebanon War|2006 War in Lebanon]], a [[Merkava]] Mark II [[tank]] was hit by a pre-positioned [[Hezbollah]] IED, killing all 4 [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] servicemen on board,<ref>{{cite journal  | last = Arkin  | first = William M.  | authorlink = William Arkin  | title = Divine Victory for Whom?

Such barrel bombs consist of barrels filled with high explosives, oil, and shrapnel, and are dropped from helicopters.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-26043061] BBC, 5 February 2014</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-25466541] BBC, 20 December 2013</ref>\n\n===United States===\nIn the 1995 [[Oklahoma City bombing]], [[Timothy McVeigh]] and [[Terry Nichols]] built an IED with [[ammonium nitrate|ammonium nitrate fertilizer]], [[nitromethane]], and stolen commercial explosives in a rental truck, with [[sandbag]]s used to concentrate the explosive force in the desired direction. McVeigh detonated it next to the [[Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building]], killing 168 people, 19 of whom were children.\n\nIn January 2011, a [[2011 Spokane bombing attempt|shaped pipe bomb was discovered]] and defused at a [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] memorial march in [[Spokane, Washington]]. The FBI said that the bomb was specifically designed to cause maximum harm as the explosive device was, according to the ''Los Angeles Times'', packed with fishing weights covered in rat poison, and may have been racially motivated. No one was injured during the event. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nOn April 15, 2013, as the annual [[Boston Marathon]] race was concluding, two bombs were [[Boston Marathon bombing|detonated]] seconds apart close to the finish line. Initial FBI response indicated suspicion of IED [[pressure cooker bomb]]s.\n\nOn September 17\u201319, 2016, [[2016 New York and New Jersey bombings|several explosions]] occurred in [[Manhattan]] and [[New Jersey]]. The sources of the explosions were all found to be IEDs of various types, such as pressure cooker bombs and [[pipe bomb]]s.\n\n===Vietnam===\nIEDs were used during the [[Vietnam War]] by the [[National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam|Viet Cong]] against land- and river-borne vehicles as well as personnel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/wars/vietnam/minesouthviet.htm |title=Mine Warfare in South Vietnam |publisher=History.navy.mil |accessdate=2009-10-18}}</ref> They were commonly constructed using materials from unexploded American [[Unexploded ordnance|ordnance]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/vietnam/series/pt_05.html |title=American Experience &#124; Vietnam Online &#124; Transcript &#124; PBS |publisher=pbs.org |accessdate=2009-10-18}}</ref> Thirty-three percent of U.S. casualties in Vietnam and twenty-eight percent of deaths were officially attributed to mines; these figures include losses caused by both IEDs and commercially manufactured mines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/reports/1997/gen1/General-03.htm |title=In Its Own Words |publisher=Hrw.org |accessdate=2009-10-18}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Grenade in a Can'' was a simple and effective [[booby trap]]. A [[hand grenade]] with the safety pin removed and safety lever compressed was placed into a container such as a tin can, with a length of string or [[tripwire]] attached to the grenade.  The can was fixed in place and the string was stretched across a path or doorway opening and firmly tied down.  In alternative fashion, the string could be attached to the moving portion of a door or gate. When the grenade was pulled out of the can by a person or vehicle placing tension on the string, the spring-loaded safety lever would release and the grenade would explode.\n\nThe ''rubber band grenade'' was another booby trap. To make this device, a Viet Cong guerrilla would wrap a strong [[rubber band]] around the spring-loaded safety lever of a hand grenade and remove the pin. The grenade was then hidden in a hut. American and [[South Vietnam]]ese soldiers would burn huts regularly to prevent them from being inhabited again, or to expose [[Defensive fighting position|foxholes]] and [[tunnel]] entrances, which were frequently concealed within these structures.  When a hut with the booby trap was torched, the rubber band on the grenade would melt, releasing the safety lever and blowing up the hut. This would often wound the soldiers with burning bamboo and metal fragments. This booby trap was also used to destroy vehicles when the modified grenade was placed in the fuel tank. The rubber band would be eaten away by the chemical action of the fuel, releasing the safety lever and detonating the grenade.\n\nAnother variant was the ''[[Antique fruit jar|Mason jar]] grenade.''  The safety pin of hand grenades would be pulled and the grenades would be placed in glass Ball Mason jars, which would hold back the safety lever.  The safety lever would release upon the shattering of the jar and the grenade would detonate.  This particular variant was popular with helicopter warfare, and were used as improvised anti-personnel cluster bombs during air raids.  They were easy to dump out of the flight door over a target, and the thick Ball Mason glass was resistant to premature shattering.  They could also be partially filled with gasoline or jellied gasoline, [[Napalm]], to add to their destructive nature.\n\n==Types==\n\n===By warhead===\nThe ''Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms'' (JCS Pub 1-02) includes two definitions for improvised devices: improvised explosive devices (IED) and [[improvised nuclear device]] (IND).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf |title=JP 1-02 Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-10-18}}</ref> These definitions address the ''Nuclear'' and ''Explosive'' in ''CBRNe''. That leaves chemical, biological and radiological undefined. Four definitions have been created to build on the structure of the JCS definition.

It may incorporate military stores, but is normally devised from non-military components.<ref name=\"AAP-6\"/>\n\n====Chemical====\nA device incorporating the toxic attributes of chemical materials designed to result in the dispersal of these toxic chemical materials for the purpose of creating a primary patho-physiological toxic effect (morbidity and mortality), or secondary psychological effect (causing fear and behavior modification) on a larger population. Such devices may be fabricated in a completely improvised manner or may be an improvised modification to an existing weapon.\n\n====Biological====\nA device incorporating biological materials designed to result in the dispersal of vector borne biological material for the purpose of creating a primary patho-physiological toxic effect (morbidity and mortality), or secondary psychological effect (causing fear and behavior modification) on a larger population. Such devices are fabricated in a completely improvised manner.\n\n====Radiological====\nA speculative device incorporating radioactive materials designed to result in the dispersal of radioactive material for the purpose of area denial and economic damage, and/or for the purpose of creating a primary patho-physiological toxic effect (morbidity and mortality), or secondary psychological effect (causing fear and behavior modification) on a larger population. Such devices may be fabricated in a completely improvised manner or may be an improvised modification to an existing nuclear weapon. Also called a Radiological Dispersion Device (RDD) or \"[[dirty bomb]]\".\n\n====Incendiary====\nA device making use of exothermic chemical reactions designed to result in the rapid spread of fire for the purpose of creating a primary patho-physiological effect (morbidity and mortality), or secondary psychological effect (causing fear and behavior modification) on a larger population or it may be used with the intent of gaining a tactical advantage. Such devices may be fabricated in a completely improvised manner or may be an improvised modification to an existing weapon. A common type of this is the [[Molotov cocktail]].\n\n====Explosively formed penetrator/projectiles (EFPs)====\n[[File:Improvised explosive device explosively formed penetrator Iraq.jpg|thumb|upright|Improvised explosive device in Iraq. The [[wiktionary:Concave|concave]] [[copper]] shape on top defines an [[Explosively formed penetrator|explosively]] formed penetrator/projectile]]\n\nIEDs have been deployed in the form of [[Explosively formed penetrator|explosively formed projectile]]s (EFP), a special type of shaped charge that is effective at long standoffs from the target (50 meters or more), however they are not accurate at long distances.  This is because of how they are produced.  The large \"slug\" projected from the explosion has no stabilization because it has no tail fins and it does not spin like a bullet from a rifle.  Without this stabilization the trajectory can not be accurately determined beyond 50 meters.  An EFP is essentially a cylindrical shaped charge with a machined concave metal disc (often copper) in front, pointed inward. The force of the shaped charge turns the disc into a high velocity slug, capable of penetrating the armor of most vehicles in Iraq.\n\n====Directionally focused charges====\nDirectionally focused charges (also known as directionally focused fragmentary charges) are very similar to EFPs, with the main difference being that the top plate is usually flat and not concave. It also is not made with machined copper but much cheaper cast or cut metal. The contents of the canister are usually nuts, bolts, ball bearings and other similar shrapnel products and explosive.\n\n===By delivery mechanism===\n\n====Car====\n{{Main article|Car bomb}}\n[[File:Iraq carbomb.jpg|thumb|[[Artillery shell]]s and [[gasoline]] cans discovered in the back of a pick-up truck in Iraq]]\n\nA vehicle may be laden with explosives, set to explode by remote control or by a passenger/driver, commonly known as a [[car bombs|car bomb]] or vehicle-borne IED (VBIED, pronounced ''vee-bid''). On occasion the driver of the car bomb may have been coerced into delivery of the vehicle under duress, a situation known as a [[proxy bomb]]. Distinguishing features are low-riding vehicles with excessive weight, vehicles with only one passenger, and ones where the interior of the vehicles look as if they have been stripped down and built back up. Car bombs can carry thousands of pounds of explosives and may be augmented with [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]] to increase fragmentation.  The U.S. State Department has published a guide on car bomb awareness.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/wiki/When_broken_down_vehicles_go_boom!|title=When broken down vehicles go boom! - WikiLeaks|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Boat====\nBoats laden with explosives can be used against ships and areas connected to water. An early example of this type was the Japanese [[Shinyo (suicide boat)|Shinyo]] suicide boats during [[World War II]]. The boats were laden with explosives and attempted to ram Allied ships, sometimes successfully, having sunk or severely damaged several American ships by war's end.

The device is constructed so that the receiver is connected to an electrical firing circuit and the transmitter operated by the perpetrator at a distance, A signal from the transmitter causes the receiver to trigger a firing pulse that operates the switch. Usually the switch fires an initiator; however, the output may also be used to remotely arm an explosive circuit. Often the transmitter and receiver operate on a matched coding system that prevents the RCIED from being initiated by spurious radio frequency signals.<ref name=\"Hunter\" /> An RCIED can be triggered from any number of different mechanisms including car alarms, wireless door bells, cell phones, pagers and encrypted [[General Mobile Radio Service|GMRS radios]].<ref name=\"Hunter\" />\n\n====Cell phone====\nA radio-controlled IED (RCIED) incorporating a cell phone that is modified and connected to an electrical firing circuit. Cell phones operate in the UHF band in line of sight with [[base transceiver station]] (BTS) antennae sites.

VOIED switches are often well hidden from the victim or disguised as innocuous everyday objects. They are operated by means of movement. Switching methods include tripwire, pressure mats, spring-loaded release, push, pull or tilt. Common forms of VOIED include the under-vehicle IED (UVIED), improvised [[landmine]]s, and [[Letter bomb|mail bombs]].<ref name=\"Hunter\" />\n\n====Infrared====\nThe British accused Iran and [[Hezbollah]] of teaching Iraqi fighters to use [[infrared]] light beams to trigger IEDs.

It later emerged however, that these \"advanced\" IEDs were actually old [[Provisional IRA|IRA]] technology. The infrared beam method was perfected by the IRA in the early '90s after it acquired the technology from a botched undercover British Army operation. Many of the IEDs being used against the invading coalition forces in [[Iraq]] were originally developed by the British Army who unintentionally passed the information on to the IRA.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/ulster/article320004.ece |title=Revealed: IRA bombs killed eight British soldiers in Iraq, '&#39;This Britain'&#39;, UK&nbsp;\u2014 Independent.co.uk |publisher=News.independent.co.uk |date=2005-10-16 |accessdate=2009-10-18 | location=London | first1=Greg | last1=Harkin | first2=Francis | last2=Elliott | first3=Raymond | last3=Whitaker}}</ref> The IRA taught their techniques to the Palestine Liberation Organisation and the knowledge spread to Iraq.<ref>{{cite news|author=Independent.ie |url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/the-death-of-the-tank-took-place-around-crossmaglen-2131116.html |title=independent.ie |publisher=independent.ie |date= 2010-04-09|accessdate=2012-05-11}}</ref>\n\n==Counterefforts==\n[[File:IED detonator.jpg|thumb|A U.S. Marine in Iraq shown with a [[robot]] used for disposal of buried devices]]\n[[File:IDF-D9-Zachi-Evenor-001.jpg|thumb|Israeli [[IDF Caterpillar D9]] [[armored bulldozer]], which is used by the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] [[Israeli Engineering Corps|Combat Engineering Corps]] for clearing heavy [[belly charge]]s and [[booby trap|booby-trapped]] buildings.]]\n{{Main article|Counter-IED efforts}}\nCounter-IED efforts are done primarily by military, law enforcement, diplomatic, financial, and intelligence communities and involve a comprehensive approach to countering the threat networks that employ IEDs, not just efforts to defeat the devices themselves.\n\n===Detection and disarmament===\nBecause the components of these devices are being used in a manner not intended by their manufacturer, and because the method of producing the explosion is limited only by the science and imagination of the perpetrator, it is not possible to follow a step-by-step guide to detect and disarm a device that an individual has only recently developed. As such, [[bomb disposal|explosive ordnance disposal]] (IEDD) operators must be able to fall back on their extensive knowledge of the first principles of [[explosives]] and [[ammunition]], to try and deduce what the perpetrator has done, and only then to [[render safe procedure|render it safe]] and dispose of or exploit the device. Beyond this, as the stakes increase and IEDs are emplaced not only to achieve the direct effect, but to deliberately target IEDD operators and cordon personnel, the IEDD operator needs to have a deep understanding of tactics to ensure he is neither setting up any of his team or the cordon troops for an attack, nor walking into one himself. The presence of [[chemical warfare|chemical]], [[biological warfare|biological]], [[radioactivity|radiological]], or [[radioactivity|nuclear]] ([[CBRN]]) material in an IED requires additional precautions. As with other missions, the EOD operator provides the area commander with an assessment of the situation and of support needed to complete the mission.\n\nMilitary and law enforcement personnel from around the world have developed a number of [[render safe procedure|render-safe procedure]]s (RSPs) to deal with IEDs.  RSPs may be developed as a result of direct experience with devices or by applied research designed to counter the threat. The supposed effectiveness of IED jamming systems, including vehicle- and [[Thor III|personally-mounted]] systems, has caused IED technology to essentially regress to command-wire detonation methods.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/an-vlq-9.htm |title=Warlock Green / Warlock Red / AN/VLQ -9 or -10 SHORTSTOP Countermeasure |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=2009-10-18}}</ref> These are physical connections between the detonator and explosive device and cannot be jammed. However, these types of IEDs are more difficult to emplace quickly, and are more readily detected.\n\nMilitary forces and law enforcement from [[India]], [[Canada]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Israel]], [[Spain]], and the [[United States]] are at the forefront of counter-IED efforts, as all have direct experience in dealing with IEDs used against them in conflict or terrorist attacks. From the research and development side, programs such as the new Canadian Unmanned Systems Challenge will bring student groups together to invent an unmanned device to both locate IEDs and pinpoint the insurgents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unlimitedmagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=504&ed=15&cat=14 |title=Messenger, Scott (2009-03-01). \"The Unmanned Mission\".
