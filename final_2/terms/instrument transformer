The most common usage of instrument transformers is to operate instruments or metering from high voltage or high current circuits, safely isolating secondary control circuitry from the high voltages or currents. The primary winding of the transformer is connected to the high voltage or high current circuit, and the meter or relay is connected to the secondary circuit.\n\nInstrument transformers may also be used as an [[isolation transformer]] so that secondary quantities may be used in phase shifting without affecting other primary connected devices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Measurement Canada Standard Dwg.

They are designed to present negligible load to the supply being measured and have an accurate current ratio and phase relationship to enable accurate secondary connected metering.\n\nCurrent transformers are often constructed by passing a single primary turn (either an [[electrical insulation|insulated]] cable or an uninsulated bus bar) through a well-insulated [[torus|toroidal]] core wrapped with many turns of wire. This affords easy implementation on high voltage bushings of grid transformers and other devices by installing the secondary turn core inside high-voltage bushing insulators and using the pass-through conductor as a single turn primary.\n\n[[File:Clampmeter.jpg|thumb|140px|Clampmeter utilizing a split core]]\nA [[current clamp]] uses a current transformer with a split core that can be easily wrapped around a conductor in a circuit.  This is a common method used in portable current measuring instruments but permanent installations use more economical types of current transformer.\nSpecially constructed [[wideband]] CTs are also used, usually with an [[oscilloscope]], to measure [[high frequency]] [[waveform]]s or pulsed currents within [[pulsed power]] systems. One type provides an IR voltage output that is proportional to the measured current; another, called a [[Rogowski coil]], requires an external [[integrator]] in order to provide a proportional output.\n\n===Ratio===\nThe CT is typically described by its current ratio from primary to secondary. A 1000:5 CT will provide an output current of 5&nbsp;amperes when 1000 amperes are flowing through its primary winding. Standard secondary current ratings are 5 amperes or 1 ampere, compatible with standard measuring instruments.\n\n===Burden and accuracy===\nBurden and accuracy are usually stated as a combined parameter due to being dependent on each other. \n:Metering style CTs are designed with smaller cores and VA capacities. This causes metering CTs to saturate at lower secondary voltages saving sensitive connected metering devices from damaging large fault currents in the event of a primary electrical fault. A CT with a rating of 0.3B0.6 would indicate with up to 0.6 ohms of secondary burden the secondary current will be within a 0.3 percent error parallelogram on an accuracy diagram incorporating both phase angle and ratio errors.<ref name=\"PS-E-14 \u2014 Provisional Specifications for the Verification, Reverification, Installation and Use of NXCT\u00ae Electronic Current Transformer\">{{cite web|title=Limits of the 0.3 and 0.6 accuracy classes for measuring current transformers|url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/mc-mc.nsf/eng/lm00147.html#Appendix|publisher=Measurement Canada|accessdate=18 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n:Relaying CTs used for protective circuits are designed with larger cores and higher VA capacities to ensure secondary measuring devices have true representations with massive grid fault currents on primary circuits. A CT with a rating of 2.5L400 would indicate it can produce a secondary voltage to 400 volts with a secondary current of 100 amperes (20 times its rated 5 ampere rating) and still be within 2.5 amperes of true accuracy.\n\nCare must be taken that the secondary winding of a CT is not disconnected from its low-impedance load while current flows in the primary, as this may produce a dangerously high voltage across the open secondary (especially in a relaying type CT) and could permanently affect the accuracy of the transformer.\n\n===Multi-ratio CT===\nThe secondary winding can be single ratio or have several [[Tap (transformer)|tap]] points to provide a range of ratios.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Voltage transformer or potential transformer==\n\n[[Image:Instrument Transformer.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A 120:120 instrument isolation transformer showing two polarity marking conventions]]\n\nVoltage transformers (VT), also called potential transformers (PT), are a parallel connected type of instrument transformer. They are designed to present negligible load to the supply being measured and have an accurate voltage ratio and phase relationship to enable accurate secondary connected metering.\n\n===Ratio===\nThe PT is typically described by its voltage ratio from primary to secondary. A 600:120 PT will provide an output voltage of 120&nbsp;volts when 600&nbsp;volts are impressed across its primary winding. Standard secondary voltage ratings are 120&nbsp;volts and 70&nbsp;volts, compatible with standard measuring instruments.\n\n===Burden and accuracy===\nBurden and accuracy are usually stated as a combined parameter due to being dependent on each other. \n:Metering style PTs are designed with smaller cores and VA capacities than power transformers. This causes metering PTs to saturate at lower secondary voltage outputs saving sensitive connected metering devices from damaging large voltage spikes found in grid disturbances. A small PT (see nameplate in photo) with a rating of 0.3W, 0.6X would indicate with up to W load (12.5 watts<ref name=\"Burdens for Voltage Transformers with 120V Rated Secondary Output\">{{cite web|title=PS-E-15 \u2014 Provisional Specifications for Approval of Electronic Voltage Transformers|url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/mc-mc.nsf/eng/lm00148.html#Section6.2|publisher=Measurement Canada|accessdate=18 April 2013}}</ref> ) of secondary burden the secondary current will be within a 0.3 percent error parallelogram on an accuracy diagram incorporating both phase angle and ratio errors.

Sometimes a second isolated winding (Y<sub>1</sub>, Y<sub>2</sub>, Y<sub>3</sub>) (and third (Z<sub>1</sub>, Z<sub>2</sub>, Z<sub>3</sub>)  may also be available on the same voltage transformer.  The primary may be connected phase to ground or phase to phase. The secondary is usually grounded on one terminal to avoid capacitive induction from damaging low-voltage equipment and for human safety.\n\n===Types of PTs===\n[[Image:Cvt.pdf|thumb|300px|Simplified circuit diagram of a CVT]]\nThere are three primary types of potential transformers (PT): electromagnetic, capacitor, and optical.  The electromagnetic potential transformer is a wire-wound transformer.  The capacitor voltage transformer (CVT) uses a capacitance potential divider and is used at higher voltages due to a lower cost than an electromagnetic PT.  An optical voltage transformer exploits the [[Faraday effect]], rotating polarized light, in optical materials.<ref>''Network Protection & Automation anshu'', AREVA 2002</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Transformers (electrical)]]"}]}}}}
