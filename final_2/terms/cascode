This eliminates the [[Miller effect]] and thus contributes to a much higher bandwidth.\n\n==History==\nThe use of a cascode (sometimes [[verbification|verbified]] to ''cascoding'') is a common technique for improving [[analog circuit]] performance, applicable to both [[vacuum tube]]s and [[transistor]]s. The name \"cascode\" was coined in a paper written by [[Frederick Vinton Hunt]] and Roger Wayne Hickman in 1939, in a discussion on the application of [[voltage stabilizer]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hunt|first1=Frederick Vinton|last2=Hickman|first2=Roger Wayne|title=On Electronic Voltage Stabilizers|journal=Review of Scientific Instruments|date=1939|volume=10|issue=1|pages=6|doi=10.1063/1.1751443|url=http://www.tubezone.net/pdf/diagrams/regulator.pdf|accessdate=20 March 2016}}</ref> They proposed a cascode of two [[triode]]s, the first one with a common [[cathode]] setup, the second one with a common [[control grid|grid]]) as a replacement for a [[pentode]], and so the name may be assumed to be a contraction of \"''casc''aded triodes having similar characteristics to a pent''ode''\".<ref>\"Cathode Ray\", \"The Cascode and its Advantages for Band III Reception\", ''Wireless World'', vol. 61, p. 397 (August 1955).</ref>\n\n==Operation==\n[[File:CascodeWithNegative.png|right|frame|Figure 1: ''N''-channel class A cascode amplifier]]\n\nFigure 1 shows an example of a cascode amplifier with a [[common source]] amplifier as the input stage driven by a signal source, ''V''<sub>in</sub>. This input stage drives a [[common gate]] amplifier as the output stage, with output signal ''V''<sub>out</sub>.\n\nAs the lower FET is conducting, by providing a gate voltage, the upper FET conducts due to the potential difference now appearing between its gate and source.\n\nThe major advantage of this circuit arrangement stems from the placement of the upper [[field-effect transistor]] (FET) as the load of the input (lower) FET's output terminal (drain). Because at operating frequencies the upper FET's gate is effectively grounded, the upper FET's source voltage (and therefore the input transistor's drain) is held at nearly constant voltage during operation. In other words, the upper FET exhibits a low input resistance to the lower FET, making the voltage gain of the lower FET very small, which dramatically reduces the [[Miller effect|Miller]] feedback capacitance from the lower FET's drain to gate. This loss of voltage gain is recovered by the upper FET. Thus, the upper transistor permits the lower FET to operate with minimum negative (Miller) feedback, improving its bandwidth.\n\nThe upper FET gate is electrically grounded, so charge and discharge of the stray capacitance, ''C<sub>dg</sub>'', between drain and gate is simply through ''R<sub>D</sub>'' and the output load (say ''R''<sub>out</sub>), and the frequency response is affected only for frequencies above the associated [[RC time constant]]: ''\u03c4'' = ''C''<sub>dg</sub> ''R''<sub>D</sub>//''R''<sub>out</sub>, namely ''f'' = 1/(2''\u03c0\u03c4''), a rather high frequency because ''C<sub>dg</sub>'' is small. That is, the upper FET gate does not suffer from Miller amplification of ''C<sub>dg</sub>''.\n\nIf the upper FET stage were operated alone using its source as input node (that is, common gate (CG) configuration), it would have a good voltage gain and wide bandwidth. However, its low input impedance would limit its usefulness to very-low impedance voltage drivers. Adding the lower FET results in a high input impedance, allowing the cascode stage to be driven by a high impedance source.\n\nIf one were to replace the upper FET with a typical inductive/resistive load and take the output from the input transistor's drain (that is, a common source(CS) configuration), the CS configuration would offer the same input impedance as the cascode, but the cascode configuration would offer a potentially greater gain and much greater bandwidth.\n\n===Stability===\nThe cascode arrangement is also very stable. Its output is effectively isolated from the input both electrically and physically. The lower transistor has nearly constant voltage at both drain and source and thus there is essentially \"nothing\" to feed back into its gate. The upper transistor has nearly constant voltage at its gate and source. Thus, the only nodes with significant voltage on them are the input and output, and these are separated by the central connection of nearly constant voltage and by the physical distance of two transistors. Thus in practice there is little feedback from the output to the input. Metal shielding is both effective and easy to provide between the two transistors for even greater isolation when required. This would be difficult in one-transistor amplifier circuits, which at high frequencies would require [[amplifier neutralization|neutralization]].\n\n===Biasing===\nAs shown, the cascode circuit using two \"stacked\" FETs imposes some restrictions on the two FETs \u2014 namely, the upper FET must be biased so its source voltage is high enough (the lower FET drain voltage may swing too low, causing it to saturate). Ensurance of this condition for FETs requires careful selection for the pair, or special biasing of the upper FET gate, increasing cost.\n\nThe cascode circuit can also be built using bipolar transistors, or MOSFETs, or even one FET (or MOSFET) and one BJT. In the latter case, the BJT must be the upper transistor; otherwise, the (lower) BJT will always saturate {{citation needed|date=August 2012}} unless extraordinary steps are taken to bias it. This circuit arrangement was very common in [[VHF]] television tuners when they employed [[vacuum tube]]s.\n\n===Advantages===\nThe cascode arrangement offers high gain, high bandwidth, high [[slew rate]], high stability, and high input impedance. The parts count is very low for a two-transistor circuit.\n\n===Disadvantages===\nThe cascode circuit requires two transistors and requires a relatively high supply voltage. For the two-FET cascode, both transistors must be biased with ample V<sub>DS</sub> in operation, imposing a lower limit on the supply voltage.\n\n===Dual-gate version===\nA [[multigate device|dual-gate MOSFET]] often functions as a \"one-transistor\" cascode. Common in the front ends of sensitive [[very high frequency|VHF]] receivers, a dual-gate MOSFET is operated as a common source amplifier with the primary gate (usually designated \"gate 1\" by MOSFET manufacturers) connected to the input and the second gate grounded (bypassed). Internally, there is one channel covered by the two adjacent gates; therefore, the resulting circuit is electrically a cascode composed of two FETs, the common lower-drain-to-upper-source connection merely being that portion of the single channel that lies physically adjacent to the border between the two gates.\n\n===Mixer in superheterodyne receivers===\nA cascode circuit is very useful as a multiplying [[frequency mixer|mixer]] circuit in [[superheterodyne]] receivers. At the lower gate the RF signal is fed to the mixer and at the upper gate the [[local oscillator]] signal is fed to the mixer. Both signals are multiplied by the mixer and the difference frequency, the [[intermediate frequency]], is taken from the upper drain of the cascode mixer.\n\nThis was further developed by cascoding whole [[differential amplifier#Long-tailed pair|differential amplifier]] stages to form the balanced mixer, and then the ''[[Gilbert cell]]'' double-balanced mixer.\n\n==Other applications==\nWith the rise of [[integrated circuit]]s, transistors have become cheap in terms of silicon die area. In [[MOSFET]] technology especially, cascoding can be used in [[current mirror]]s to increase the output impedance of the output [[current source]].\n\nA modified version of the cascode can also be used as a [[modulation|modulator]], particularly for [[amplitude modulation]]. The upper device supplies the audio signal, and the lower is the [[RF modulator|RF]] amplifier device.\n\n[[File:Cascode-voltage-ladder.png|thumb|right|High-voltage stack]]\nA cascode may also be combined with a [[voltage ladder]] to form a high-voltage transistor. The input transistor may be any low-U<sub>CEO</sub> type, while the others, acting as stacked [[linear regulator#Simple series regulator|linear series]] [[voltage regulator]]s, should be able to withstand a considerable fraction of the supply voltage. Note that, for a large output voltage swing, their base voltages should '''not''' be bypassed to ground by capacitors, and the uppermost ladder resistor should be able to withstand the full supply voltage.\nThis shows that a linear series voltage regulator is actually a current buffer with its ''input'' and ''output'' designations swapped.\n\n==Two-port parameters==\nThe cascode configuration can be represented as a simple voltage amplifier (or more accurately as a g-parameter [[two-port network]]) by using its [[input impedance]], [[output impedance]], and voltage [[gain (electronics)|gain]]. These parameters are related to the corresponding g-parameters below.<ref>In the [[two-port network#Inverse hybrid parameters (g-parameters)|g-parameter two-port]], ''g<sub>12</sub>'' is the reverse current gain. When no such feedback occurs, ''g<sub>12</sub> = 0'' and the network is called '''unilateral'''.</ref> Other useful properties not considered here are circuit [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] and [[dynamic range#Electronics|dynamic range]].\n\n===BJT cascode: low-frequency small-signal parameters===\n[[File:BJT Cascode.png|thumbnail|200px|Figure 2: BJT Cascode using ideal current sources for DC bias and large coupling capacitors to ground and to the AC signal source; capacitors are short circuits for AC]]\n\nThe idealized [[small-signal]] equivalent circuit can be constructed for the circuit in figure 2 by replacing the current sources with open-circuits and the capacitors with short circuits, assuming they are large enough to act as short-circuits at the frequencies of interest. The BJTs can be represented in the small-signal circuit by the [[hybrid-pi model]].<ref name=Gray-Meyer1>\n{{cite book\n|title= Analysis and Design of Analog Integrated Circuits\n|author1= Paul R.

That fact has implications in the discussion that follows.\n\n===Low-frequency design===\n[[File:BJT Cascode Small-signal Circuit.png|thumbnail|400px|Fig. 4 Top: Small-signal BJT cascode using [[hybrid-pi model]] Bottom: [[Equivalent circuit]] for BJT cascode using amplifier low-frequency parameters]]\nThe g-parameters found in the above formulas can be used to construct a small-signal voltage amplifier with the same gain, input and output resistance as the original cascode (an [[equivalent circuit]]). This circuit applies only at frequencies low enough that the transistor [[parasitic capacitance]]s do not matter. The figure shows the original cascode (Fig. 1) and the equivalent voltage amplifier or g-equivalent two-port (Fig. 4). The equivalent circuit allows easier calculations of the behavior of the circuit for different drivers and loads. In the figure a [[Th\u00e9venin equivalent]] voltage source with Th\u00e9venin resistance ''R<sub>S</sub>'' drives the amplifier, and at the output a simple load resistor ''R<sub>L</sub>'' is attached. Using the equivalent circuit, the input voltage to the amplifier is (see [[Voltage divider]]):\n::<math>{\\upsilon}_{in} = {\\upsilon}_s \\begin{matrix} \\frac {R_{in}}{R_S + R_{in}} \\end{matrix}</math>,\nwhich shows the importance of using a driver with resistance ''R<sub>S</sub> << R<sub>in</sub>'' to avoid attenuation of the signal entering the amplifier. From the above amplifier characteristics, we see that ''R<sub>in</sub>'' is infinite for the MOSFET cascode, so no attenuation of input signal occurs in that case. The BJT cascode is more restrictive because ''R<sub>in</sub> = r<sub>\u03c02</sub>''.\n\nIn a similar fashion, the output signal from the equivalent circuit is\n::<math>{\\upsilon}_{out} = A_v \\ {\\upsilon}_{in} \\begin{matrix} \\frac {R_{L}}{R_L + R_{out}} \\end{matrix}</math>.\n\nIn low-frequency circuits, a high voltage gain is typically desired, hence the importance of using a load with resistance ''R<sub>L</sub> >> R<sub>out</sub>'' to avoid attenuation of the signal reaching the load. The formulas for ''R<sub>out</sub>'' can be used either to design an amplifier with a sufficiently small output resistance compared to the load or, if that cannot be done, to decide upon a modified circuit, for example, to add a [[voltage follower]] that matches the load better.\n\nThe earlier estimate showed that the cascode output resistance is very large. The implication is that many load resistances will not satisfy the condition ''R<sub>L</sub> >> R<sub>out</sub>'' (an important exception is driving a MOSFET as the load, which has infinite low frequency input impedance). However, the failure to satisfy the condition ''R<sub>L</sub> >> R<sub>out</sub>'' is not catastrophic because the cascode gain also is very large. If the designer is willing, the large gain can be sacrificed to allow a low load resistance; for ''R<sub>L</sub>'' << ''R<sub>out</sub>'' the gain simplifies as follows:\n::<math>{\\upsilon}_{out} = A_v \\ {\\upsilon}_{in} \\begin{matrix} \\frac {R_{L}}{R_L + R_{out}} \\approx A_v \\ {\\upsilon}_{in} \\frac {R_{L}}{R_{out}} = \\frac {A_v }{R_{out}}\\ {\\upsilon}_{in} R_L \\approx -g_{m2} R_L {\\upsilon}_{in}\\end{matrix}</math>.\nThis gain is the same as that for the input transistor acting alone. Thus, even sacrificing gain, the cascode produces the same gain as the single-transistor transconductance amplifier, but with wider bandwidth.\n\nBecause the amplifiers are wide bandwidth, the same approach can determine the bandwidth of the circuit when a load capacitor is attached (with or without a load resistor). The assumption needed is that the load capacitance is large enough that it controls the frequency dependence, and bandwidth is not controlled by the neglected parasitic capacitances of the transistors themselves.\n\n===High-frequency design===\nAt high frequencies, the parasitic capacitances of the transistors (gate-to-drain, gate-to-source, drain-to body, and bipolar equivalents) must be included in the hybrid pi models to obtain an accurate frequency response. The design goals also differ from the emphasis on overall high gain as described above for low-frequency design. In high frequency circuits, [[impedance matching]] at the input and output of the amplifier is typically desired in order to eliminate signal reflections and maximize [[power gain]]. In the cascode, the isolation between the input and output [[port (circuit theory)|ports]] is still characterized by a small reverse transmission term g<sub>12</sub>, making it easier to design matching networks because the amplifier is approximately unilateral.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n{{Transistor amplifiers}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Multi-stage transistor amplifiers]]"}]}}}}
