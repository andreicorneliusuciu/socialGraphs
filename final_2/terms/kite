Kites may be flown for [[recreation]], [[art]] or other [[#Practical uses|practical]] uses. [[Sport kites]] can be flown in aerial [[ballet]], sometimes as part of a competition. [[Power kite]]s are multi-line steerable kites designed to generate large [[force]]s which can be used to power activities such as [[kite surfing]], [[kite landboarding]], [[kite fishing]], [[kite buggying]] and a new trend [[snow kiting]].

Over the next 70 years, many new kite designs were developed, and often patented. These included [[William Abner Eddy|Eddy]]'s tail-less diamond kite, the tetrahedral kite, the flexible kite, the sled kite, and the parafoil kite, which helped to develop modern hang-gliders.<ref name=\"History of Kites\">{{cite web|title=History of Kites|url=http://kites.com/history-of-kites.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}</ref>  In fact, the period from 1860 to about 1910 became the \"golden age of kiting\". Kites started to be used for scientific purposes, especially in meteorology, aeronautics, wireless communications and [[kite aerial photography|photography]]; many different designs of [[man-lifting kite]] were developed as well as [[power kite]]s.\n\nThe development of mechanically powered airplane diminished interest in kites. [[World War II]] saw a limited use of kites for military purposes (see [[Focke Achgelis Fa 330]] for an example). Since then they are used mainly for recreation.\n\n==Materials==\n[[File:Sparless Styrofoam kite in flight.jpg|thumb|left|Sparless [[Styrofoam]] kites]]\n\nDesigns often emulate flying insects, birds, and other beasts, both real and mythical. The finest Chinese kites are made from split bamboo (usually golden bamboo), covered with silk, and hand painted. On larger kites, clever hinges and latches allow the kite to be disassembled and compactly folded for storage or transport. Cheaper mass-produced kites are often made from printed [[polyester]] rather than silk.\n\nTails are used for some [[Inflatable single-line kite|single-line kite]] designs to keep the kite's nose pointing into the wind. Spinners and spinsocks can be attached to the flying line for visual effect. There are rotating wind socks which spin like a [[turbine]]. On large display kites these tails, spinners and spinsocks can be {{convert|50|feet|m|0}} long or more.\n\nModern aerobatic kites use two or four lines to allow fine control of the kite's angle to the wind. Traction kites may have an additional line to de-power the kite and quick-release mechanisms to disengage flyer and kite in an emergency.\n\n==Practical uses==\n{{Main article|Kite applications}}\n\nKites have been used for human flight, military applications, science and meteorology, photography, lifting radio antennas, generating power, aerodynamics experiments, and much more.\n\n[[File:Chinese dragon kite (Berkeley, California - 2000).jpg|thumb|Chinese dragon kite more than one hundred feet long which flew in the annual [[Berkeley, California]], kite festival in 2000]]\n\n===Military applications===\nKites have been used for [[military]] purposes in the past, such as  signaling, delivery of [[munition]]s, and for [[observation]], both by lifting an observer above the field of battle and by using [[kite aerial photography]].\n\nAccording to ''[[Samguk Sagi]]'', in 637 [[Kim Yu-sin]], a Korean general of [[Silla]] rallied his troops to defeat rebels by lofting a kite with a [[Straw man (dummy)|straw man]] which looked like a burning ball flying to the sky.<ref name=\"EncyKorea\">{{cite web|url=http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&i=251011&v=44 |title=\uc5f0 \u9cf6 (Yeon) |publisher=[[Nate (web portal)|Nate]] / [[Encyclopedia of Korean Culture]] |language=Korean |accessdate=July 30, 2009 |quote=<!-- \uc6b0\ub9ac \ub098\ub77c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \u226a\uc0bc\uad6d\uc0ac\uae30\u226b \uc5f4\uc804(\u5217\u50b3) \uae40\uc720\uc2e0\uc870(\u91d1\u5ebe\u4fe1\u689d)\uc5d0, \uc9c4\ub355\uc655 \uc989\uc704 1\ub144\uc5d0 \ub300\uc2e0 \ube44\ub2f4(\u6bd7\u66c7)\uacfc \uc5fc\uc885(\u5ec9\u5b97)\uc758 \ubc18\ub780\uc774 \uc77c\uc5b4\ub0ac\uc744 \ub54c \uc6d4\uc131(\u6708\u57ce)\uc5d0 \ud070 \ubcc4\uc774 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c0\ubbc0\ub85c \uc655\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \ub450\ub824\uc6cc\ud558\uc790 \uae40\uc720\uc2e0\uc774 \ud5c8\uc218\uc544\ube44\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5b4 \uc5f0\uc5d0 \ub2ec\uc544 \ub744\uc6b0\ub2c8 \ubd88\ub369\uc774\uac00 \ud558\ub298\uc5d0 \uc62c\ub77c\uac00\ub294 \ub4ef\ud558\uc600\ub2e4\ub294 \uae30\uc0ac\uac00 \ucc98\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\uc628\ub2e4. \uc774\ub85c \ubcfc \ub54c \uc774 \uc2dc\uae30\uc5d0\ub294 \uc774\ubbf8 \uc5f0\uc774 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ub610\ud55c \ub180\uc774\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc804\uc7c1\uc758 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c\ub3c4 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uc5c8\uc74c\uc744 \uc54c \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. -->}}</ref>\n\nRussian chronicles mention Prince [[Oleg of Novgorod]] use of kites during the siege of [[Constantinople]] in 906: \"and he crafted horses and men of paper, armed and gilded, and lifted them into the air over the city; the Greeks saw them and feared\".{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nKites were also used by [[Admiral Yi]] of the [[Joseon Dynasty]] (1392{{ndash}}1910) of Korea.

Kites were the precursors to the traditional [[aircraft]], and were instrumental in the development of early flying craft. [[Alexander Graham Bell]] experimented with very large [[man-lifting kite]]s, as did the [[Wright brothers]] and [[Lawrence Hargrave]]. Kites had a historical role in lifting scientific instruments to measure atmospheric conditions for [[weather forecasting]]. [[Francis Ronalds]] and [[William Radcliffe Birt]] described a very stable kite at [[King's Observatory|Kew Observatory]] as early as 1847 that was trialled for the purpose of supporting self-registering meteorological instruments at height.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Radio aerials and light beacons===\nKites can be used for radio purposes, by kites carrying antennas for [[Medium frequency|MF]], [[Low frequency|LF]] or [[VLF]]-transmitters. This method was used for the reception station of the first transatlantic transmission by [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]]. [[moored balloon|Captive balloons]] may be more convenient for such experiments, because kite-carried antennas require a lot of wind, which may be not always possible with heavy equipment and a ground conductor. It must be taken into account during experiments, that a conductor carried by a kite can lead to a high voltage toward ground, which can endanger people and equipment, if suitable precautions (grounding through resistors or a [[parallel resonant-circuit]] tuned to transmission frequency) are not taken.\n\nKites can be used to carry light effects such as lightsticks or battery powered lights.\n\n===Kite traction===\n[[File:Kite333.JPG|thumb|A quad-line traction kite, commonly used as a power source for [[kite surfing]]]]\n\nKites can be used to pull people and vehicles downwind. Efficient [[Foil kite|foil-type kites]] such as [[power kite]]s can also be used to sail upwind under the same principles as used by other sailing craft, provided that lateral forces on the ground or in the water are redirected as with the keels, center boards, wheels and ice blades of traditional sailing craft. In the last two decades several kite sailing sports have become popular, such as kite buggying, kite landboarding, [[kiteboating|kite boating]] and kite surfing. Snow kiting has also become popular in recent years.\n\nKite sailing opens several possibilities not available in traditional sailing:\n\n* Wind speeds are greater at higher altitudes\n* Kites may be manoeuvered dynamically which increases the force available dramatically\n* There is no need for mechanical structures to withstand bending forces; vehicles or hulls can be very light or dispensed with all together\n\n===Underwater kites===\nUnderwater kites are being developed to harvest renewable power from the flow of water.<ref>[http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/20/wales-launches-25m-underwater-kite-turbine-scheme Wales launches \u00a325m underwater kite-turbine scheme] The Guardian (retrieved 17 November 2015)</ref><ref>[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/underwater-kites-can-harness-ocean-currents-to-create-clean-energy-180947694/?no-ist Underwater Kites Can Harness Ocean Currents to Create Clean Energy] Smithsonian.com (retrieved 17 November 2015)</ref>\n\n== Cultural uses ==\n\n[[File:Peter-lynn-octopus.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Launch of ram-air inflated [[Peter Lynn]] single-line kite, shaped like an octopus and {{convert|90|ft|m|0}} long]]\n\nKite festivals are a popular form of entertainment throughout the world.

Tails are not used on fighter kites so that agility and maneuverability are not compromised.\n\nIn [[Afghanistan]], kite flying is a popular game, and is known in [[Dari (Eastern Persian)|Dari]] as ''Gudiparan Bazi''. Some kite fighters pass their strings through a mixture of ground glass powder and glue, which is legal. The resulting strings are very abrasive and can sever the competitor's strings more easily. The abrasive strings can also injure people. During the [[Taliban]] rule in Afghanistan, kite flying was banned, among various other recreations.\n\nIn [[Pakistan]], kite flying is often known as Gudi-Bazi or Patang-bazi. Although kite flying is a popular ritual for the celebration of spring festival known as  [[Jashn-e-Baharaan]] (lit. Spring Festival) or [[Basant]], kites are flown throughout the year. [[Fighter kite|Kite fighting]] is a very popular pastime all around Pakistan, but mostly in urban centers across the country (especially [[Lahore]]).  The kite fights are at their highest during the spring celebrations and the fighters enjoy competing with rivals to cut-loose the string of the others kite, this is popularly known as \"Paecha\". During the spring festival, kite flying competitions are held across the country and the skies are colored with kites. As people cut-loose an opponents kite, shouts of 'wo kata' ring through the air. They reclaim the kites, after they have been cut-loose, by running after them. This is a popular ritual especially among the youth (similar to scenes depicted in the Kite Runner which is based in neighboring Afghanistan).  Kites and strings are a big business in the country and many types of strings are used: glass-coated strings, metal strings and tandi. However, kite flying was recently banned in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] due to recent motorcyclist deaths caused by glass-coated or metal kite-strings.  Kup, Patang, Guda, and Nakhlaoo are some of the kites used. They vary in balance, weight and speed.\n\nIn [[Vietnam]], kites are flown without tails. Instead small flutes are attached allowing the wind to \"hum\" a musical tune. There are other forms of sound-making kites. In Bali, large bows are attached to the front of the kites to make a deep throbbing vibration, and in Malaysia row of gourds with sound-slots are used to create a whistle as the kite flies. Malaysia has also the [[Kite Museum (Malacca)|Kite Museum]] in [[Malacca]].<ref>Pogadaev, Victor. Svetly Mesyatz-Zmei Kruzhitsa (My Lord Moon Kite) - \"Vostochnaya Kollektsia\" (Oriental Collection).

During the [[India]]n spring festival of [[Makar Sankranti]], near the middle of January, millions of people fly kites all over northern India.  Kite flying in Hyderabad starts a month before this, but kite flying/fighting is an important part of other celebrations, including [[Republic Day]], Independence Day, [[Raksha Bandhan]], [[Vishvakarman#Vishwakarma Puja|Viswakarma Puja day]] in late September and [[Janmashtami]]. An international kite festival is held every year before [[Uttarayan]] for three days in [[Vadodara]], [[Surat]] and [[Ahmedabad]].\n\n[[File:Bermuda Kite 01.jpg|thumb|[[Bermuda kite]]]]\n\n[[Weifang]], [[Shandong]], [[China]] is the kite capital of the world. China is the oldest place, probably with India where kites have been flown since antiquities. It is home to the largest kite museum in the world, the thousands of kites here have a display area of {{convert|87188|sqft|m2|0}}. Weifang hosts an annual international kite festival on the large salt flats south of the city. There are several kite museums in Japan, UK, [[Malaysia]], Indonesia, [[Taiwan]], Thailand and the USA.\n\nIn the olden days, Malays in [[Singapore]], kites were used for fishing.<ref>{{cite book|last=Skeat|first=Walter William|title=Malay Magic: An Introduction to the Folklore and Popular Religion of the Malay Peninsular|year=1965|isbn=978-0-7146-2026-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K9Ly7Q9p-dgC&lpg=PA475&dq=cock%20fighting%20malay&pg=PA485#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=485}}</ref>\n[[File:Japanese kites.jpg|thumbnail|Traditional Japanese kites]]\nIn Japan, kite flying is traditionally a children's play in New Year holidays and in the Boys' Festival in May. In some areas, there is a tradition to celebrate a new boy baby with a new kite (\u795d\u3044\u51e7). There are many kite festivals throughout Japan. The most famous one is \"Y\u014dkaichi Giant Kite Festival\" in [[Higashi\u014dmi, Shiga]], which started in 1841.<ref>[http://cgi2.nhk.or.jp/michi/cgi/detail.cgi?dasID=D0004200022_00000 \u516b\u65e5\u5e02\u5927\u51e7\u307e\u3064\u308a][[NHK]](video)</ref> The largest kite ever built in the festival is {{convert|62|ft|m|0}} wide by {{convert|67|ft|m|0}} high and weighs {{convert|3307|lbs|kg|0}}.<ref>[http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~et3m-tkkw/h4.html GIANT KITE FESTIVALS IN JAPAN ] Japanese Kite Collection</ref> In the [[Hamamatsu Kite Festival]] in [[Hamamatsu, Shizuoka]], more than 100 kites are flown in the sky over the [[Nakatajima Sand Dunes]], one of the three largest sand dunes in Japan, which overlooks the Enshunada Sea.<ref>[http://www.jnto.go.jp/eng/location/spot/festival/hamamatsufes.html A spectacular festival of some 100 large kites flying over sand dunes.] Japan National Tourism Organization</ref> The parents who had a new baby prepare a new kite with their baby's name and fly it in the festival.<ref>[http://cgi2.nhk.or.jp/michi/cgi/detail.cgi?dasID=D0004200028_00000\u3000Hamamatsu Matsuri] [[NHK]]</ref> Those kites are traditional ones made from bamboo and paper.\n\n=== Europe ===\nIn [[Greece]] and [[Cyprus]], flying kites is a tradition for [[Clean Monday]], the first day of [[Lent]]. In the [[British Overseas Territory]] of [[Bermuda]], traditional [[Bermuda kite]]s are made and flown at [[Easter]], to symbolise Christ's ascent. Bermuda kites hold the world records for altitude and duration. In [[Fuerteventura]] a kite festival is usually held on the weekend nearest to 8 November lasting for 3 days.\n\n=== Polynesia ===\n[[File:Charles-Barraud-maori-kite.jpg|thumb|[[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] kite]]\n\nPolynesian traditional kites are sometimes used at ceremonies and variants of traditional kites for amusement. Older pieces are kept in museums. These are treasured by the people of Polynesia.\n\n=== South America ===\nIn [[Brazil]], flying a kite is a very popular leisure activity for children, teenagers and even young adults. Mostly these are boys, and it is overwhelmingly [[kite fighting]] a game whose goal is to maneuver their own kites to cut the other persons' kites' strings during flight, and followed by [[kite running]] where participants race through the streets to steal the free-drifting kites. As in other countries with similar traditions, injuries are common and motorcyclists in particular need to take precautions.<ref>[http://www.mirantesmt.com/2012/06/11/motorcyclists-worst-nightmare-brazils-deadly-kites/ \"A Motorcyclist\u2019s Worst Nightmare \u2013 Brazil\u2019s Deadly Kite lines.\"]</ref>\n\nIn [[Chile]], kites are very popular, especially during Independence Day festivities (September 18).\n\nIn [[Colombia]], kites can be seen flown in parks and recreation areas during August which is known to be windy. It is during this month that most people, especially the young ones would fly kites.\n\nIn [[Guyana]], kites are flown at Easter, an activity in which all ethnic and religious groups participate. Kites are generally not flown at any other time of year. Kites start appearing in the sky in the weeks leading up to Easter and school children are taken to parks for the activity. It all culminates in a massive airborne celebration on Easter Monday especially in Georgetown, the capital, and other coastal areas. The history of the practice is not entirely clear but given that Easter is a Christian festival, it is said that kite flying is symbolic of the Risen Lord. Moore<ref>Moore, Brian L. (1995). ''Cultural Power, Resistance, and Pluralism: Colonial Guyana 1838-1900.'' McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, ISBN 978-0-7735-1354-9</ref> describes the phenomenon in the 19th century as follows:\n\n{{quote|A very popular Creole pastime was the flying of kites. Easter Monday, a public holiday, was the great kite-flying day on the sea wall in Georgetown and on open lands in villages. Young and old alike, male and female, appeared to be seized by kite-flying mania. Easter 1885 serves as a good example. \"The appearance of the sky all over Georgetown, but especially towards the Sea Wall, was very striking, the air being thick with kites of all shapes and sizes, covered with gaily coloured paper, all riding bravely on the strong wind.|(His quotation is from a letter to The Creole newspaper of December 29, 1858.)}}\n\nThe exact origins of the practice of kite flying (exclusively) at Easter are unclear. Brereton and Yelvington<ref>Brereton, Bridget; Yelvington, Kevin A. (1999). ''The Colonial Caribbean in Transition''. University Press of Florida, ISBN 978-0-8130-1696-2</ref> speculate that kite flying was introduced by Chinese indentured immigrants to the then colony of British Guiana in the mid 19th century. The author of an article in the ''Guyana Chronicle'' newspaper of May 6, 2007 is more certain:\n\n{{quote|Kite flying originated as a Chinese tradition to mark the beginning of spring. However, because the plantation owners were suspicious of the planter class (read \"plantation workers\"), the Chinese claimed that it represented the resurrection of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]].  It was a clever argument, as at that time, Christians celebrated Easter to the glory of the risen Christ. The Chinese came to Guyana from 1853{{ndash}}1879.<ref>[http://www.guyanachronicle.com/ARCHIVES/archive%2006-05-07.html] ''Guyana Chronicle.'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416173653/http://www.guyanachronicle.com/ARCHIVES/archive%2006-05-07.html |date=April 16, 2008 }}</ref>}}\n\n==Popular culture==\n*''[[The Kite Runner]]'', a 2005 novel by [[Khaled Hosseini]] dramatizes the role of [[kite fighting]] in pre-war [[Kabul]].\n*The ''[[Peanuts]]'' cartoon character [[Charlie Brown]] was often depicted having flown his kite into a tree as a metaphor for life's adversities.\nMary Poppins: Let's Go Fly A Kite scene where The Banks Family sings while flying a kite.\nMulan: In the parade scene, you'll see some kites flying.\n\n==Kite altitude record==\n\nThe World record for the highest single kite was set on September 23, 2014.

Kite lines can strike and tangle on electrical power lines, causing power blackouts and running the risk of electrocuting the kite flier. Wet kite lines or wire can act as a conductor for static electricity and lightning when the weather is stormy. Kites with large surface area or powerful lift can lift kite fliers off the ground or drag them into other objects. In urban areas there is usually a ceiling on how high a kite can be flown, to prevent the kite and line infringing on the airspace of helicopters and light aircraft.  It is also possible for Fighter kites to kill people, as happened in India when three spectators were killed in separate incidents during Independence Day, August, 2016 {{mdash}} precipitating a ban on certain types of enhanced line.\n\n==Designs==\n[[File:DeltaKite.JPG|thumb|Delta kite]]\n[[File:Stringoperamaskkite.JPG|thumb|Train of connected kites]]\n\n*[[Bermuda kite]]\n*[[Bowed kite]], e.g. [[Rokkaku dako|Rokkaku]]\n*Cellular or [[box kite]]\n*[[Chapi-chapi]]\n*Delta kite\n*[[Foil kite|Foil]], [[parafoil]] or [[bow kite]]\n*[[Leading edge inflatable kite]]\n*[[Malay kite]] see also [[wau bulan]]\n*[[Tetrahedral kite]]\n*Traditional kite \n*Moon kite\n\n==Types==\n{{Main article|Kite types}}\n*[[Expanded polystyrene kite]]\n*[[Fighter kite]]\n*[[Indoor kite]]\n*[[Inflatable single-line kite]]\n*[[Kytoon]]\n*[[Man-lifting kite]]\n*[[Rogallo wing|Rogallo parawing kite]]\n*[[Sport kite|Stunt (sport) kite]]\n*[[Paravane (water kite)|Water kite]]\n*[[Caribbean Kite (Traditional kite)|Tobago kite]]\n\n[[File:Worlds Largest Kite - Aloft - Taken in 2004.jpg|thumb|A kite in the shape of the [[flag of Kuwait]].
