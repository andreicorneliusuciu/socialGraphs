Keeping all current entering a transformer or coupled inductances, in phase, through dotted leads or ports will keep the magnetic flow circulating without cancelling each other, and the device will work under their rated efficiency.  \n\nEntering current on different dotted ports -one in a dotted port  and the other with an un-dotted port- will cause the magnetic flow components to sustract each other, making the device working ineficciently.\nThis criteria holds for devices with several coils, in order to have each of them aggregating in an aditive way by entering dotted ports.\n\nLeads of primary and secondary windings are said be of the same polarity when instantaneous current entering the primary winding lead results in instantaneous current leaving the secondary winding lead as though the two leads were a continuous circuit.{{sfn|Knowlton|p.552, \u00a715}}{{sfn|Alexander|2009|p=559\u2013560}} \nIn the case of two windings wound around the same core in parallel, for example, the polarity will be the same on the same ends: A sudden (instantaneous) current in the first coil will induce a voltage opposing the sudden increase ([[Lenz's law]]) in the first and also in the second coil, because the inductive magnetic field produced by the current in the first coil traverses the two coils in the same manner. \nThe second coil will therefore show an induced current opposite in direction to the inducing current in the first coil. Both leads behave like a continuous circuit, one current entering into the first lead and another current leaving the second lead.\n\n== Marking Methods ==\n\nA dot marking convention, or alphanumeric marking convention, or both, can be used to denote the same relative instantaneous '''[[Polarity (physics)|polarity]]''' of two [[Mutual_inductance#Coupled_inductors_and_mutual_inductance|mutually inductive]] components such as between [[transformer]] windings. These markings may be found on transformer cases beside terminals, winding leads, nameplates, schematic and wiring diagrams.\n\n==Transformer windings==\nTwo methods are commonly used to denote which terminals present the same relative polarity. A dot may be used, or an alphanumeric designation. Alphanumeric designations are typically in the form H<sub>1</sub> for primaries, and for secondaries, X<sub>1</sub>, (and Y<sub>1</sub>, Z<sub>1</sub>, if more windings present).\n\nUnlike single-phase transformers, three-phase transformers may incorporate a phase shift due to different winding configurations resulting in a multiple of 30 degree phase shift between H1 and X1 bushing designations.\n\n==Terminal layout conventions==\nReferring to the circuit diagrams below:{{dubious|date=April 2015}}\nThe circuit polarity signs '+' and '-' indicate the relative polarities of the induced voltages in both coils, i.e. how an instantaneous (sudden) magnetic field traversing the primary and secondary coils induces a voltage in both coils.\n:The instantaneous polarities of the voltages across each inductor with respect to the dotted terminals are the same.<ref name=\"Relative polarities\">{{cite web|title=PS-E-15 \u2014 Provisional Specifications for Approval of Electronic Voltage Transformers|url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/mc-mc.nsf/eng/lm00148.html#Section8.2|publisher=Measurement Canada|accessdate=18 April 2013}}</ref>  \n\n:The circuit arrows indicate example applied and resultant relative current directions. The '+' and '-' polarities in the diagram are not the voltages driving the currents.\n:The instantaneous directions of the current entering the primary inductor at its dotted end and the current leaving of the secondary inductor at its dotted end are the same.\n\n:'''Subtractive  polarity''' transformer designs are shown in the upper circuit diagrams. '''Additive polarity''' transformer designs are shown in the lower circuit diagrams.<ref name=\"Transformer Polarity\">{{cite web|title=Transformer Polarity|url=http://www.idc-online.com/technical_references/pdfs/electrical_engineering/Transformer_Polarity.pdf|publisher=.idc-online/electrical_engineering|accessdate=23 April 2013}}</ref> \n\n[[Image:Mutual inductance.PNG]]\n\n==Autotransformers==\nIf two mutually coupled inductors are in series, the dot convention can be used in the same manner as in the case of [[autotransformer]]s. Relative polarity in autotransformer drawings is usually quite obvious by physical placement of the windings in circuit drawings.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Electrical polarity]]\n* [[Instrument transformer]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Charles|title=Fundamentals of electric circuits|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2009|isbn=0073529559|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Grossner|first=Nathan|title=Transformers for Electronic Circuits|page=26|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1967|isbn=0070249792|ref=harv}}\n* ANSI/IEEE C57.13, American National Standard Requirements for Instrument Transformers\n* {{cite conference|author2=Javid, Mansour|last=Brenner|first=Egon|title=\u00a718.1 'Symbols and Polarity of Mutual Inductance' in Chapter 18 - Circuits with Magnetic Circuits|booktitle=Analysis of Electric Circuits|year=1959|publisher=McGraw-Hill|pages=589\u2013590|url=http://books.google.ca/books/about/Analysis_of_electric_circuits.html?id=V4FrAAAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y}}\n* {{cite book| last=Boylestad | first=Robert L. | author-link=Robert Boylestad\n| year=2003 | edition=10th | title=Introductory Circuit Analysis\n| chapter=Section 21.8: Series connection of mutually coupled coils | page=954\n| publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] | isbn=0-13-097417-X}}\n* {{cite book|last=Knowlton|first=A.E.
