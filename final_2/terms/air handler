Sometimes AHUs discharge (''supply'') and admit (''return'') air directly to and from the space served without ductwork.\n\nSmall air handlers, for local use, are called '''terminal units''', and may only include an air filter, coil, and blower; these simple terminal units are called [[blower coil]]s or [[fan coil unit]]s.  A larger air handler that conditions 100% outside air, and no recirculated air, is known as a '''makeup air unit''' ('''MAU''').  An air handler designed for outdoor use, typically on roofs, is known as a '''packaged unit''' ('''PU''') or '''rooftop unit''' ('''RTU''').\n\n==Construction==\nThe air handler is normally constructed around a framing system with metal infill panels as required to suit the configuration of the components. In its simplest form the frame may be made from metal channels or sections, with single skin metal infill panels. The metalwork is normally [[galvanized]] for long term protection. For outdoor units some form of weatherproof lid and additional sealing around joints is provided.<ref name=Carrier/>\n\nLarger air handlers will be manufactured from a square section steel framing system with double skinned and [[Thermal insulation|insulated]] infill panels. Such constructions reduce heat loss or heat gain from the air handler, as well as providing [[acoustic attenuation]].<ref name=Carrier/> Larger air handlers may be several meters long and are manufactured in a ''sectional'' manner and therefore, for strength and rigidity, steel section base rails are provided under the unit.<ref name=Carrier/>\n\nWhere supply and extract air is required in equal proportions for a balanced ventilation system, it is common for the supply and extract air handlers to be joined together, either in a ''side-by-side'' or a ''stacked'' configuration.\n\n==Components==\nThe major types of components are described here in approximate order, from the return duct (input to the AHU), through the unit, to the supply duct (AHU output).<ref name=ASHRAE/><ref name=Carrier/>\n\n===Filters===\n{{main|Air filter}}\nAir filtration is almost always present in order to provide clean dust-free air to the building occupants. It may be via simple [[Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value|low-MERV]] pleated media, [[HEPA]], [[Electrostatic precipitator|electrostatic]], or a combination of techniques. Gas-phase and ultraviolet air treatments may be employed as well.\n\nFiltration is typically placed first in the AHU in order to keep all the downstream components clean. Depending upon the grade of filtration required, typically filters will be arranged in two (or more) successive banks with a coarse-grade panel filter provided in front of a fine-grade bag filter, or other \"final\" filtration medium. The panel filter is cheaper to replace and maintain, and thus protects the more expensive bag filters.<ref name=ASHRAE/>\n\nThe life of a filter may be assessed by monitoring the pressure drop through the filter medium at design air volume flow rate. This may be done by means of a visual display using a pressure gauge, or by a pressure switch linked to an alarm point on the building control system. Failure to replace a filter may eventually lead to its collapse, as the forces exerted upon it by the fan overcome its inherent strength, resulting in collapse and thus contamination of the air handler and downstream ductwork.\n\n===Heating and/or cooling elements===\n{{main|Heat exchanger#HVAC air coils}}\nAir handlers may need to provide heating, cooling, or both to change the supply air temperature, and humidity level depending on the location and the application. Such conditioning is provided by heat exchanger coil(s) within the air handling unit air stream, such coils may be ''direct'' or ''indirect'' in relation to the medium providing the heating or cooling effect.<ref name=ASHRAE/><ref name=Carrier/>\n\nDirect heat exchangers include those for gas-fired fuel-burning heaters or a [[refrigeration]] [[evaporator]], placed directly in the air stream. [[Heating element|Electric resistance]] heaters and [[heat pump]]s can be used as well. [[Evaporative cooling]] is possible in dry climates.\n\nIndirect [[Heat exchanger#HVAC air coils|coils]] use hot [[water]] or [[steam]] for heating, and chilled water for cooling (prime energy for heating and cooling is provided by central plant elsewhere in the building). Coils are typically manufactured from copper for the tubes, with copper or aluminium fins to aid heat transfer. Cooling coils will also employ eliminator plates to remove and drain condensate. The hot water or steam is provided by a central [[boiler]], and the chilled water is provided by a central [[chiller]]. Downstream temperature sensors are typically used to monitor and control \"off coil\" temperatures, in conjunction with an appropriate motorized control valve prior to the coil. \n\nIf [[dehumidification]] is required, then the cooling coil is employed to ''over-cool'' so that the [[dew point]] is reached and condensation occurs. A heater coil placed after the cooling coil re-heats the air (therefore known as a ''re-heat coil'') to the desired supply temperature. This has the effect of reducing the [[relative humidity]] level of the supply air.\n\nIn colder climates, where winter temperatures regularly drop below freezing, then ''frost coils'' or ''pre-heat'' coils are often employed as a first stage of air treatment to ensure that downstream filters or chilled water coils are protected against freezing. The control of the frost coil is such that if a certain off-coil air temperature is not reached then the entire air handler is shut down for protection.\n\n===Humidifier===\n{{main|Humidifier}}\nHumidification is often necessary in colder climates where continuous heating will make the air drier, resulting in uncomfortable air quality and increased [[Electrostatics|static electricity]]. Various types of humidification may be used:\n*Evaporative: dry air blown over a reservoir will evaporate some of the water. The rate of evaporation can be increased by spraying the water onto baffles in the air stream.\n*Vaporizer: steam or vapor from a boiler is blown directly into the air stream.\n*Spray mist: water is diffused either by a nozzle or other mechanical means into fine droplets and carried by the air.\n*[[ultrasonic humidifier|Ultrasonic]]: A tray of fresh water in the airstream is excited by an ultrasonic device forming a fog or water mist.\n*Wetted medium: A fine fibrous medium in the airstream is kept moist with fresh water from a header pipe with a series of small outlets. As the air passes through the medium it entrains the water in fine droplets. This type of humidifier can quickly clog if the primary air filtration is not maintained in good order.\n\n===Mixing chamber===\n{{Main|Air-mixing plenum}}\nIn order to maintain indoor air quality, air handlers commonly have provisions to allow the introduction of outside air into, and the exhausting of air from the building. In temperate climates, mixing the right amount of cooler outside air with warmer return air can be used to approach the desired supply air temperature. A mixing chamber is therefore used which has [[damper (architecture)|dampers]] controlling the ratio between the return, outside, and exhaust air.\n\n===Blower/fan===\n{{main|Mechanical fan|Centrifugal fan}}\nAir handlers typically employ a large [[Centrifugal fan|squirrel cage blower]] driven by an AC induction [[electric motor]] to move the air. The blower may operate at a single speed, offer a variety of set speeds, or be driven by a [[Variable Frequency Drive]] to allow a wide range of [[airflow|air flow]] rates. Flow rate may also be controlled by inlet vanes or outlet dampers on the fan. Some residential air handlers in USA (central \"furnaces\" or \"air conditioners\") use a [[brushless DC electric motor]] that has variable speed capabilities.<ref name=ASHRAE/>  Air handlers in Europe and Australia and New Zealand now commonly use backward curve fans without scroll or \"plug fans\".  These are driven using high efficiency EC (electronically commutated) motors with built in speed control. \n\nMultiple blowers may be present in large commercial air handling units, typically placed at the end of the AHU and the beginning of the supply ductwork (therefore also called \"supply fans\"). They are often augmented by fans in the return air duct (\"return fans\") pushing the air into the AHU.\n\n===Balancing===\nUn-balanced fans wobble and vibrate.  For home AC fans, this can be a major problem: air circulation is greatly reduced at the vents (as wobble is lost energy), efficiency is compromised, and noise is increased. Another major problem in fans that are not balanced is longevity of the bearings (attached to the fan and shaft) is compromised. This can cause failure to occur long before the bearings life expectancy.\n\nWeights can be strategically placed to correct for a smooth spin (for a ceiling fan, trial and error placement typically resolves the problem).  But for a home / central AC fan or big fan are typically taken to shops, which have special balancers for more complicated balancing (trial and error can cause damage before the correct points are found).  The fan motor itself does not typically vibrate.\n\n===Heat recovery device===\n{{main|Heat recovery ventilation}}\nA heat recovery device [[heat exchanger]] of many types, may be fitted to the air handler between supply and extract airstreams for energy savings and increasing capacity. These types more commonly include for:\n* [[Recuperator]], or Plate Heat exchanger: A sandwich of plastic or metal plates with interlaced air paths. Heat is transferred between airstreams from one side of the plate to the other. The plates are typically spaced at 4 to 6mm apart. Can also be used to recover coolth. Heat recovery efficiency up to 70%.\n* [[Thermal Wheel]], or Rotary heat exchanger: A slowly rotating matrix of finely corrugated metal, operating in both opposing airstreams. When the air handling unit is in heating mode, heat is absorbed as air passes through the matrix in the exhaust airstream, during one half rotation, and released during the second half rotation into the supply airstream in a continuous process. When the air handling unit is in cooling mode, heat is released as air passes through the matrix in the exhaust airstream, during one half rotation, and absorbed during the second half rotation into the supply airstream. Heat recovery efficiency up to 85%. Wheels are also available with a [[hydroscopic|hydroscopic coating]] to provide latent heat transfer and also the drying or humidification of airstreams.\n* [[Run around coil]]: Two air to liquid heat exchanger coils, in opposing airstreams, piped together with a circulating pump and using water or a brine as the heat transfer medium. This device, although not very efficient, allows heat recovery between remote and sometimes multiple supply and exhaust airstreams.  Heat recovery efficiency up to 50%.\n* [[Heat Pipe]]: Operating in both opposing air paths, using a confined [[refrigerant]] as a heat transfer medium. The heat pipe uses multiple sealed pipes mounted in a coil configuration with fins to increase heat transfer. Heat is absorbed on one side of the pipe, by evaporation of the refrigerant, and released at the other side, by condensation of the refrigerant. Condensed refrigerant flows by gravity to the first side of the pipe to repeat the process. Heat recovery efficiency up to 65%.\n\n===Controls===\n{{main|Building automation|Building management system}}\n[[HVAC control system|Controls]] are necessary to regulate every aspect of an air handler, such as: [[airflow|flow rate of air]], supply air temperature, mixed air temperature, humidity, air quality. They may be as simple as an off/on [[thermostat]] or as complex as a [[building automation]] system using [[BACnet]] or [[LonWorks]], for example.\n\nCommon control components include temperature sensors, humidity sensors, sail switches, [[actuator]]s, motors, and controllers.\n\n===Vibration isolators===\nThe blowers in an air handler can create substantial vibration and the large area of the duct system would transmit this noise and vibration to the occupants of the building. To avoid this, vibration isolators (flexible sections) are normally inserted into the duct immediately before and after the air handler and often also between the fan compartment and the rest of the AHU. The rubberized canvas-like material of these sections allows the air handler components to vibrate without transmitting this motion to the attached ducts.\n\nThe fan compartment can be further isolated by placing it on a spring suspension, which will mitigate the transfer of vibration through the floor.\n\n==Major manufacturers==\n<!-- DON'T ADD COMPANIES THAT DON'T HAVE WIKIPEDIA ARTICLES (if they are not notable for their own article, they are not notable for inclusion on this list) -->\n*[[Carrier Corporation]] (also makes Bryant and Payne brands)\n*[[CIAT Group]]\n*[[Daikin Industries]] (also makes [[McQuay International]], [[Goodman Global|Goodman]], and Airfel brands)\n*[[Emerson Network Power]]\n*[[Johnson Controls]] (also makes [[York International]] brand)\n*[[Lennox International]]\n*[[Rheem]] (also makes Ruud)\n*[[Trane]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[HVAC]]\n*[[Thermal comfort]]\n*[[Indoor air quality]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|60em}}\n\n{{HVAC}}\n\n[[Category:Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning]]\n[[Category:Mechanical engineering]]"}]}}}}
