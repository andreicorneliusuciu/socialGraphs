Smaller alligators can often be found in large numbers close to each other. The largest of the species (both males and females) defend prime territory; smaller alligators have a higher tolerance for other alligators within a similar size class.\n\nAlligators move on land by two forms of locomotion referred to as \"sprawl\" and \"high walk\". The sprawl is a forward movement with the belly making contact with the ground and is used to transition to \"high walk\" or to slither over wet substrate into water. The high walk is an up on four limbs forward motion used for overland travel with the belly well up from the ground.<ref>Reilly & Elias, [http://jeb.biologists.org/content/201/18/2559.full.pdf Locomotion In Alligator Mississippiensis: Kinematic Effects Of Speed And Posture and Their Relevance To The Sprawling-to-Erect Paradigm] The Journal of Experimental Biology 201, 2559\u20132574 (1998)</ref> Alligators have also been observed to rise up and balance on their hind legs and semi step forward as part of a forward or upward lunge.

Alligators' main prey are smaller animals they can kill and eat with a single bite. They may kill larger prey by grabbing it and dragging it into the water to drown. Alligators consume food that can not be eaten in one bite by allowing it to rot, or by biting and then spinning or convulsing wildly until bite-sized chunks are torn off. This is referred to as a \"death roll\".  Critical to the alligator's ability to initiate a death roll, the tail must flex to a significant angle relative to its body. An alligator with an immobilized tail cannot perform a death roll.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Fish | first = Frank E. |author2= Bostic, Sandra A.|author3= Nicastro, Anthony J.|author4= Beneski, John T. | title = Death roll of the alligator: mechanics of twist feeding in water | journal = [[The Journal of Experimental Biology]] | volume = 210 | issue = 16 | pages = 2811\u20132818 | year = 2007 | url =http://darwin.wcupa.edu/~biology/fish/pubs/pdf/2007JEBDedathRoll.pdf |format=PDF | doi = 10.1242/jeb.004267 | pmid = 17690228}}</ref>\n\nMost of the muscle in an alligator's jaw evolved to bite and grip prey. The muscles that close the jaws are exceptionally powerful, but the muscles for opening their jaws are comparatively weak. As a result, an adult human can hold an alligator's jaws shut bare-handed. It is common today to use several wraps of [[duct tape]] to prevent an adult alligator from opening its jaws when being handled or transported.<ref>[http://crocodilian.com/crocfaq/faq-3.html Crocodilian Captive Care FAQ:] How to properly handle/transport crocodilians etc.</ref>\n\nAlligators are generally timid towards humans and tend to walk or swim away if one approaches. This has led some people to the practice of approaching alligators and their nests in a manner that may provoke the animals into attacking. In Florida, feeding wild alligators at any time is illegal. If fed, the alligators will eventually lose their fear of humans and will learn to associate humans with food, thereby becoming both a greater danger to people, and at greater risk from them.<ref>[http://www.myfwc.com/CONSERVATION/ConservationYou_Living_w_Wildlife_alligators.htm Living ''with'' Alligators]</ref>\n\n== Diet ==\nThe type of food eaten by alligators depends upon their age and size. When young, alligators eat fish, insects, [[snail]]s, [[crustacean]]s, and [[worm]]s. As they mature, progressively larger prey is taken, including larger fish such as [[gar]], turtles, and various mammals, particularly coypu and muskrat,<ref name=\"Dundee, H. A. 1989\" /> as well as birds, deer, and other reptiles.<ref>Wolfe, J. L., D. K. Bradshaw, and R. H. Chabreck. 1987. Alligator feeding habits: New data and a review.

Report to Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, New Orleans.</ref> Their stomachs also often contain [[gastrolith|gizzard stones]]. They will even consume [[carrion]] if they are sufficiently hungry. In some cases, larger alligators are known to ambush dogs, [[Florida panther]]s and [[American Black Bear|black bears]], making it the [[apex predator]] throughout its distribution. In this role as a top predator, it may determine the abundance of prey species, including turtles and [[coypu]].<ref>Bondavalli, C., and R. E. Ulanowicz. 1998.

The sex of the offspring is [[Temperature-dependent sex determination|determined by the temperature]] in the nest and is fixed within seven to 21 days of the start of incubation. Incubation temperatures of 86&nbsp;\u00b0F (30&nbsp;\u00b0C) or lower produce a clutch of females; those of 93&nbsp;\u00b0F (34&nbsp;\u00b0C) or higher produce entirely males. Nests constructed on leaves are hotter than those constructed on wet marsh, so the former tend to produce males and the latter, females. The baby alligator's [[egg tooth]]  helps it get out of its egg during hatching time. The natural sex ratio at hatching is five females to one male. Females hatched from eggs incubated at 86&nbsp;\u00b0F weigh significantly more than males hatched from eggs incubated at 93&nbsp;\u00b0F.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Mark W. J.

She will provide protection to the young for about a year if they remain in the area. The largest threat to the young are adult alligators. Predation by adults on young can account for a mortality rate of up to 50% in the first year. In the past, immediately following the outlawing of alligator [[hunting]], populations rebounded quickly due to the suppressed number of adults preying upon juveniles, increasing survival among the young alligators.\n\n== Anatomy ==\n[[File:Albino Alligator in Water.jpg|thumb|right|A rare albino alligator swimming]]\nAlligators, much like birds, have been shown to exhibit unidirectional movement of air through their lungs.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Farmer, C.

For a tidal breathing animal, such as a mammal, air flows into and out of the lungs through branching [[bronchi]] which terminate in small dead-end chambers called [[alveoli]]. As the alveoli represent dead-ends to flow, the inspired air must move back out the same way it came in. In contrast, air in alligator lungs makes a circuit, moving in only one direction through the [[parabronchi]]. The air first enters the outer branch, moves through the parabronchi, and exits the lung through the inner branch. Extensive vasculature around the parabronchi are where oxygen exchange takes place.<ref>Science News; February 13, 2010; Page 11</ref>\n\nThey have muscular, flat tails that propel them while swimming.\n\nThe two kinds of white alligators are [[albino]] and [[Leucism|leucistic]].
