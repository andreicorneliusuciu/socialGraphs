The relation between the sides and angles of a right triangle is the basis for [[trigonometry]].\n\nThe side opposite the right angle is called the ''[[hypotenuse]]'' (side ''c'' in the figure). The sides adjacent to the right angle are called ''legs'' (or ''catheti'', singular: ''[[wikt:cathetus|cathetus]]''). Side ''a'' may be identified as the side ''adjacent to angle B'' and ''opposed to'' (or ''opposite'') ''angle A'', while side ''b'' is the side ''adjacent to angle A'' and ''opposed to angle B''.\n\nIf the lengths of all three sides of a right triangle are integers, the triangle is said to be a '''Pythagorean triangle''' and its side lengths are collectively known as a [[Pythagorean triple]].\n\n==Principal properties==\n\n===Area===\nAs with any triangle, the area is equal to one half the base multiplied by the corresponding height. In a right triangle, if one leg is taken as the base then the other is height, so the area of a right triangle is one half the product of the two legs. As a formula the area ''T'' is\n:<math>T=\\tfrac{1}{2}ab</math>\n\nwhere ''a'' and ''b'' are the legs of the triangle.\n\nIf the [[Incircle and excircles of a triangle|incircle]] is tangent to the hypotenuse AB at point P, then denoting the [[semi-perimeter]] {{nowrap|(''a'' + ''b'' + ''c'') / 2}} as ''s'', we have  {{nowrap|PA {{=}} ''s'' \u2212 ''a''}} and {{nowrap|PB {{=}} ''s'' \u2212 ''b''}}, and the area is given by\n:<math>T=\\text{PA} \\cdot \\text{PB} = (s-a)(s-b).</math>\n\nThis formula only applies to right triangles.<ref>Di Domenico, Angelo S., \"A property of triangles involving area\", ''[[Mathematical Gazette]]'' 87, July 2003, pp. 323-324.</ref>\n\n===Altitudes===\n[[Image:Teorema.png|thumb|right|Altitude of a right triangle]]<!--Better diagram needed here.-->\nIf an [[Altitude (triangle)|altitude]] is drawn from the vertex with the right angle to the hypotenuse then the triangle is divided into two smaller triangles which are both [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] to the original and therefore similar to each other.

For a given angle, a right triangle may be constructed with this angle, and the sides labeled opposite, adjacent and hypotenuse with reference to this angle according to the definitions above. These ratios of the sides do not depend on the particular right triangle chosen, but only on the given angle, since all triangles constructed this way are [[similar triangles|similar]]. If, for a given angle \u03b1, the opposite side, adjacent side and hypotenuse are labeled ''O'', ''A'' and ''H'' respectively, then the trigonometric functions are\n:<math>\\sin\\alpha =\\frac {O}{H},\\,\\cos\\alpha =\\frac {A}{H},\\,\\tan\\alpha =\\frac {O}{A},\\,\\sec\\alpha =\\frac {H}{A},\\,\\cot\\alpha =\\frac {A}{O},\\,\\csc\\alpha =\\frac {H}{O}.</math>\n\nFor the expression of [[hyperbolic function]]s as ratio of the sides of a right triangle, see the [[hyperbolic sector#Hyperbolic triangle|hyperbolic triangle]] of a [[hyperbolic sector]].\n\n==Special right triangles==\n{{main|Special right triangles}}\nThe values of the trigonometric functions can be evaluated exactly for certain angles using right triangles with special angles. These include the ''30-60-90 triangle'' which can be used to evaluate the trigonometric functions for any multiple of \u03c0/6, and the ''45-45-90 triangle'' which can be used to evaluate the trigonometric functions for any multiple of \u03c0/4.\n\n===Kepler triangle===\nLet ''H'', ''G'', and ''A'' be the [[harmonic mean]], the [[geometric mean]], and the [[arithmetic mean]] of two positive numbers ''a'' and ''b'' with ''a'' > ''b''.

The converse states that if a right triangle is inscribed in a circle then the hypotenuse will be a diameter of the circle. A corollary is that the length of the hypotenuse is twice the distance from the right angle vertex to the midpoint of the hypotenuse. Also, the center of the circle that [[Circumscribed circle|circumscribes]] a right triangle is the midpoint of the hypotenuse and its radius is one half the length of the hypotenuse.\n\n==Medians==\nThe following formulas hold for the [[median (geometry)|medians]] of a right triangle:\n:<math>m_a^2 + m_b^2 = 5m_c^2 = \\frac{5}{4}c^2.</math>\n\nThe median on the hypotenuse of a right triangle divides the triangle into two isosceles triangles, because the median equals one-half the hypotenuse.\n\nThe medians ''m''<sub>''a''</sub> and ''m''<sub>''b''</sub> from the legs satisfy<ref name=Crux/>{{rp|p.136,#3110}}\n\n:<math>4c^4+9a^2b^2=16m_a^2m_b^2.</math>\n\n==Euler line==\nIn a right triangle, the [[Euler line]] contains the median on the hypotenuse\u2014that is, it goes through both the right-angled vertex and the midpoint of the side opposite that vertex.
