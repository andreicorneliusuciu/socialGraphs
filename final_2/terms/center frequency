It is usually defined as either the [[arithmetic mean]] or the [[geometric mean]] of the lower cutoff frequency and the upper cutoff frequency of a [[band-pass filter|band-pass system]] or a [[band-stop filter|band-stop system]].\n\nTypically, the geometric mean is used in systems based on certain transformations of [[lowpass filter]] designs, where the [[frequency response]] is constructed to be symmetric on a [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] frequency scale.<ref>{{cite book | title = CRC Handbook of Electrical Filters | author = John T.
