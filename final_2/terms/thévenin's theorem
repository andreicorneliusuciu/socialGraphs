This means that R<sub>th</sub> could alternatively be calculated as V<sub>th</sub> divided by the short-circuit current between A and B when they are connected together.\n\nIn [[circuit theory]] terms, the theorem allows any [[one-port]] network to be reduced to a single [[voltage source]] and a single impedance.\n\nThe theorem also applies to frequency domain AC circuits consisting of [[Reactive power|reactive]] and [[resistance (electricity)|resistive]] [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]s.\n\nThe theorem was independently derived in 1853 by the German scientist [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] and in 1883 by [[L\u00e9on Charles Th\u00e9venin]] (1857&ndash;1926), an [[electrical engineering|electrical engineer]] with France's national [[Postes, t\u00e9l\u00e9graphes et t\u00e9l\u00e9phones (France)|Postes et T\u00e9l\u00e9graphes]] telecommunications organization.<ref>Helmholtz</ref><ref>Th\u00e9venin (1883a)</ref><ref>Th\u00e9venin (1883b)</ref><ref>Johnson (2003a)</ref><ref>Brittain</ref><ref name=\"Dorf\">Dorf</ref>\n\nTh\u00e9venin's theorem and its dual, [[Norton's theorem]], are widely used to make circuit analysis simpler and to study a circuit's initial-condition and steady-state response.<ref>Brenner</ref><ref>Elgerd</ref> Th\u00e9venin's theorem can be used to convert any circuit's sources and impedances to a '''Th\u00e9venin equivalent'''; use of the theorem may in some cases be more convenient than use of [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]].<ref name=\"Dorf\"/><ref>Dwight</ref>\n\n== Calculating the Th\u00e9venin equivalent ==\nThe equivalent circuit is a voltage source with voltage ''V''<sub>Th</sub> in series with a resistance ''R''<sub>Th</sub>.\n\nThe Th\u00e9venin-equivalent voltage ''V''<sub>Th</sub> is the voltage at the output terminals of the original circuit.  When calculating a Th\u00e9venin-equivalent voltage, the [[voltage divider]] principle is often useful, by declaring one terminal to be ''V''<sub>out</sub> and the other terminal to be at the ground point.\n\nThe Th\u00e9venin-equivalent resistance ''R''<sub>Th</sub> is the resistance measured across points A and B \"looking back\" into the circuit.  It is important to first replace all voltage- and current-sources with their internal resistances.  For an ideal voltage source, this means replace the voltage source with a short circuit. For an ideal current source, this means replace the current source with an open circuit. Resistance can then be calculated across the terminals using the formulae for [[series and parallel circuits]]. This method is valid only for circuits with independent sources. If there are [[dependent source]]s in the circuit, another method must be used such as connecting a test source across A and B and calculating the voltage across or current through the test source.\n\nNote that the replacement of voltage and current sources do the ''opposite'' of what the sources themselves are meant to do. A voltage source creates a difference of electric potential between its terminals; its replacement in Th\u00e9venin's theorem resistance calculations, a short circuit, equalizes potential. Likewise, a current source's aim is to generate a certain amount of current, whereas an open circuit stops electric flow altogether.\n\n===Example===\n[[Image:thevenin-example-png.png|thumb|left|upright=2.9|1.

However, the power dissipated by an external resistor between the two output terminals is the same regardless of how the internal circuit is implemented.\n\n==A proof of the theorem==\n\nThe proof involves two steps. First use [[superposition theorem]] to construct a solution. Then, use [[uniqueness theorem]] to show the solution is unique. The second step is usually implied. First, using the superposition theorem, in general for any linear \"black box\" circuit which contains voltage sources and resistors, one can always write down its voltage as a linear function of the corresponding current as follows\n:<math>V = V_\\mathrm{Eq}-Z_\\mathrm{Eq}I \\!</math>\nwhere the first term reflects the linear summation of contributions from each voltage source, while the second term measures the contribution from all the resistors. The above argument is due to the fact that the voltage of the black box for a given current <math>I</math> is identical to the linear superposition of the solutions of the following problems: (1) to leave the black box open circuited but activate individual voltage source one at a time and, (2) to short circuit all the voltage sources but feed the circuit with a certain ideal voltage source so that the resulting current exactly reads <math>I</math> (or an ideal current source of current <math>I</math>). Once the above expression is established, it is straightforward to show that  <math> V_\\mathrm{Eq} </math> and <math> Z_\\mathrm{Eq} </math> are the single voltage source and the single series resistor in question.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Millman's theorem]]\n*[[Source transformation]]\n*[[Superposition theorem]]\n*[[Norton's theorem]]\n*[[Maximum power transfer theorem]]\n*[[Extra element theorem]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite conference|last2=Javid|first2=Mansour|last1=Brenner|first1=Egon|title=Chapter 12 - Network Functions|booktitle=Analysis of Electric Circuits|year=1959|publisher=McGraw-Hill|pages=268\u2013269|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V4FrAAAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Brittain|first=J.E.|title=Thevenin's theorem|journal=IEEE Spectrum|date=March 1990|volume=27|issue=3|pages=42|doi=10.1109/6.48845|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/searchresult.jsp?newsearch=true&queryText=James+E.+Brittain+Thevenin%27s+theorem&.x=41&.y=17|accessdate=1 February 2013}}\n*{{cite conference|last=Dorf|first=Richard C.|author2=Svoboda, James A. |title=Chapter 5 - Circuit Theorems|booktitle=Introduction to Electric Circuits|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=978-0-470-52157-1|url=http://ca.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP000347.html|edition=8th|pages=162\u2013207}}\n*{{cite conference|booktitle=Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers |editor-last=Knowlton|editor-first=A.E.|edition=8th|year=1949|title=Sec. 2 - Electric and Magnetic Circuits|first=Herbert B.|last=Dwight|publisher=McGraw-Hill|page=26}}\n*{{cite conference|last=Elgerd|first=Olle I.|title=Chapter 10, Energy System Transients - Surge Phenomena and Symmetrical Fault Analysis|booktitle=Electric Energy Systems Theory: An Introduction|year=2007|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill|pages=402\u2013429|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AKTi3UxfhlgC&redir_esc=y|isbn=978-0070192300}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Helmholtz|first=H.\n|title=\u00dcber einige Gesetze der Vertheilung elektrischer Str\u00f6me in k\u00f6rperlichen Leitern mit Anwendung auf die thierisch-elektrischen Versuche (Some laws concerning the distribution of electrical currents in conductors with applications to experiments on animal electricity)|journal=Annalen der Physik und Chemie|volume=89|issue=6|pages=211\u2013233|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k151746.image.f225.langFR|year=1853}} \n*{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=D.H.|title=Origins of the equivalent circuit concept: the voltage-source equivalent|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|year=2003a|volume=91|issue=4|pages=636\u2013640|doi=10.1109/JPROC.2003.811716|url=http://www.ece.rice.edu/~dhj/paper1.pdf}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=D.H.|title=Origins of the equivalent circuit concept: the current-source equivalent|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|year=2003b|volume=91|issue=5|pages=817\u2013821|doi=10.1109/JPROC.2003.811795|url=http://www.ece.rice.edu/~dhj/paper2.pdf}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Th\u00e9venin|first=L.|title=Extension de la loi d\u2019Ohm aux circuits \u00e9lectromoteurs complexes (Extension of Ohm\u2019s law to complex electromotive circuits)|journal=Annales T\u00e9l\u00e9graphiques|year=1883a|volume=10|series=3<sup>e</sup> series|pages=222\u2013224|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=shUAAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA222&lpg=PA222&dq=Extension+de+la+loi+d%E2%80%99Ohm+aux+circuits+%C3%A9lectromoteurs+complexes#v=onepage&q=Extension%20de%20la%20loi%20d%E2%80%99Ohm%20aux%20circuits%20%C3%A9lectromoteurs%20complexes&f=false}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Th\u00e9venin|first=L.|title=Sur un nouveau th\u00e9or\u00e8me d'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 dynamique (On a new theorem of dynamic electricity)|journal=[[Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des s\u00e9ances de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences]]|volume=97|pages=159\u2013161|year=1883b}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Wenner|first=F.|title=Sci.
