It was formed in 1963 from the amalgamation of the [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers]] and the [[Institute of Radio Engineers]].  Today, it is the world's largest association of technical professionals with more than 400,000 members in chapters around the world. Its objectives are the educational and technical advancement of [[Electrical engineering|electrical and electronic engineering]], [[telecommunication]]s, [[computer engineering]] and allied disciplines.\n\n==Name==\n\nIEEE stands for the \"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers\". The association is chartered under this full legal name. IEEE's membership has long been composed of engineers and scientists. Allied professionals who are members include computer scientists, software developers, information technology professionals, physicists, and medical doctors, in addition to IEEE's electrical and electronics engineering core. For this reason the organization no longer goes by the full name, except on legal business documents, and is referred to simply as IEEE.\n\nThe IEEE is dedicated to advancing technological innovation and excellence. It has about 430,000 members in about 160 countries, slightly less than half of whom reside in the [[United States]].<ref name=\"ieee_quick_facts\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ieee.org/about/today/at_a_glance.html#sect1 |title=IEEE at a Glance > IEEE Quick Facts |publisher=IEEE |date=December 31, 2010 |accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"ieee_annual_report_10\">{{cite web|url=http://annualreport.ieee.org/|title=IEEE 2013 Annual Report |publisher=IEEE |date=March 2014 |accessdate=March 24, 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:3 Park Avenue.JPG|thumb|right|The IEEE corporate office is on the 17th floor of [[3 Park Avenue]] in [[New York City]]]]\n\n==History==\n\nThe major interests of the [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers|AIEE]] were wire communications ([[telegraphy]] and [[telephony]]) and light and power systems. The [[Institute of Radio Engineers|IRE]] concerned mostly [[radio]] engineering, and was formed from two smaller organizations, the Society of Wireless and Telegraph Engineers and the Wireless Institute. With the rise of [[electronics]] in the 1930s, electronics engineers usually became members of the IRE, but the applications of electron tube technology became so extensive that the technical boundaries differentiating the IRE and the AIEE became difficult to distinguish. After World War II, the two organizations became increasingly competitive, and in 1961, the leadership of both the IRE and the AIEE resolved to consolidate the two organizations. The two organizations formally merged as the IEEE on January 1, 1963.\n\nNotable presidents of IEEE and its founding organizations include [[Elihu Thomson]] (AIEE, 1889\u20131890), [[Alexander Graham Bell]] (AIEE, 1891\u20131892), [[Charles Proteus Steinmetz]] (AIEE, 1901\u20131902), [[Robert H. Marriott]] (IRE, 1912), [[Lee De Forest]] (IRE, 1930), [[Frederick Terman|Frederick E. Terman]] (IRE, 1941), [[William Reddington Hewlett|William R. Hewlett]] (IRE, 1954), [[Ernst Weber (engineer)|Ernst Weber]] (IRE, 1959; IEEE, 1963), and [[Ivan Getting]] (IEEE, 1978).\n\n== Mission and Vision ==\nAccording to IEEE\u2019s official website,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ieee.org/about/vision_mission.html|title=IEEE  IEEE Mission & Vision|website=www.ieee.org|access-date=2016-09-17}}</ref> their \u201c\u2026core purpose is to foster technological innovation and excellence for the benefit of humanity.\u201d\n\nTheir vision is to become essential to the technological community that exists throughout the world. They want their members to be the ones to revolutionize technology and improve global conditions. IEEE\u2019s core values include trust, growth and nurturing, global community building, partnership, service to humanity, and integrity in action.\n\n== Organization ==\nThe IEEE is incorporated under the [[Not-for-Profit Corporation]] Law of the state of [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref name=\"tab_operations_manual\">{{cite web|url=//www.ieee.org/about/volunteers/tab_operations_manual.pdf |title=IEEE Technical Activities Board Operations Manual |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=November 10, 2010}}, section 1.1 IEEE Incorporation</ref>  It was formed in 1963 by the merger of the [[Institute of Radio Engineers]] (IRE, founded 1912) and the [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers]] (AIEE, founded 1884).\n\nThe IEEE serves as a major publisher of [[scientific journal]]s and organizer of [[academic conference|conference]]s, workshops, and symposia (many of which have associated published [[proceedings]]).  It is also a leading [[standards organization|standards development organization]] for the development of industrial standards (having developed over 900 active industry [[technical standard]]s)  in a broad range of disciplines, including [[electric power]] and [[energy]], [[health science|biomedical technology and healthcare]], [[information technology]], [[information security|information assurance]], telecommunications, consumer electronics, transportation, aerospace, and [[nanotechnology]].  IEEE develops and participates in educational activities such as [[School accreditation|accreditation]] of electrical engineering programs in institutes of higher learning. The IEEE logo is a diamond-shaped design which illustrates the [[right hand grip rule]] embedded in [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s kite, and it was created at the time of the 1963 merger.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ieee.org/about/toolkit/masterbrand/index.html |title=IEEE \u2013 Master Brand and Logos |publisher=www.ieee.org |accessdate=2011-01-28}}</ref>\n\nIEEE has a dual complementary regional and technical structure \u2013 with organizational units based on geography (e.g., the IEEE [[Philadelphia]] Section, [http://www.ieee-bv.org the IEEE Buenaventura Section], IEEE South Africa Section [http://www.ieee.org.za]) and technical focus (e.g., the [[IEEE Computer Society]]).  It manages a separate organizational unit (IEEE-USA) which recommends policies and implements programs specifically intended to benefit the members, the profession and the public in the United States.\n\nThe IEEE includes 39 technical Societies, organized around specialized technical fields, with more than 300 local organizations that hold regular meetings.\n\nThe [[IEEE Standards Association]] is in charge of the standardization activities of the IEEE.\n\nThe IEEE History Center became a feeder organization to the [[Engineering and Technology History Wiki]] (ETHW) in 2015. The new ETHW is a cooperative effort by various engineering societies as a formal repository of topic articles, oral histories, first-hand histories, Landmarks + Milestones and archival documents. The IEEE History Center is annexed to Stevens University Hoboken, NJ.\n\nIn 2016, the IEEE acquired [[GlobalSpec]], adding the provision of engineering data for a profit to its organizational portfolio.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = IEEE Acquires GlobalSpec and the Engineering360 Platform from IHS to Create Powerful New Resource for the Global Engineering Community\n  | publisher = IEEE\n  | date = April 29, 2016\n  | url = http://www.ieee.org/about/news/2016/29april_2016.html\n  | accessdate = 2016-04-29}}</ref>\n\n== Current Leadership ==\nBarry L. Shoop, 2016 President and CEO of IEEE has been a member of the organization for more than thirty years. He received his BS from Penn State and his PhD from Stanford University. He currently works at West Point Military Academy where he was Director of the Electrical Engineering Program and the Director of the Photonics Research Center. Currently he is a Professor of Electrical Engineering and Head of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.\n\nIEEE\u2019s 2016 President-Elect is Karen Bartleson. She has over thirty-five years of experience in the semiconductor industry and retired as Senior Director of Corporate Programs and Initiatives at Synopsys, a company that specializes in electronic design automation. Bartleson was President of the IEEE Standards Association in 2013 and 2014 where she led the development of a new strategic plan, among other projects.\n\n==Publications==\n{{Main article|List of Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers publications}}\n\nIEEE produces over 30% of the world's literature in the electrical and electronics engineering and computer science fields, publishing well over 100 [[Academic journal|peer-reviewed journals]].<ref name=\"about_IEEE\">[http://www.ieee.org/about/ About IEEE]</ref>\n\nThe published content in these journals as well as the content from several hundred annual conferences sponsored by the IEEE are available in the IEEE online digital library, IEEE ''Xplore'', for subscription-based access and individual publication purchases.<ref>[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org IEEE's online digital library]</ref>\n\nIn addition to journals and conference proceedings, the IEEE also publishes tutorials and the standards that are produced by its standardization committees.\n\n==Educational activities==\nThe IEEE provides learning opportunities within the engineering sciences, research, and technology. The goal of the IEEE education programs is to ensure the growth of skill and knowledge in the electricity-related technical professions and to foster individual commitment to continuing education among IEEE members, the engineering and scientific communities, and the general public.\n\nIEEE offers educational opportunities such as ''IEEE e Learning Library,''<ref>[http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/subscriptions/prod/elearning_overview.html IEEE \u2013 IEEE Expert Now<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>   the ''Education Partners Program'',<ref>[http://www.ieee.org/web/education/partners/eduPartners.html IEEE \u2013 IEEE Education Partners Program<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  ''Standards in Education''<ref>[http://www.ieee.org/portal/cms_docs/education/setf/index.html IEEE \u2013 The IEEE Standards Education pages have moved<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  and ''Continuing Education Units'' (CEUs).<ref>[http://www.ieee.org/web/education/ceus/index.html IEEE \u2013 IEEE Continuing Education Units<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n''IEEE eLearning Library'' is a collection of online educational courses designed for self-paced learning. Education Partners, exclusive for IEEE members, offers on-line degree programs, certifications and courses at a 10% discount.  The Standards in Education website explains what standards are and the importance of developing and using them. The site includes tutorial modules and case illustrations to introduce the history of standards, the basic terminology, their applications and impact on products, as well as news related to standards, book reviews and links to other sites that contain information on standards. Currently, twenty-nine states in the [[United States]] require Professional Development Hours (PDH) to maintain a [[Regulation and licensure in engineering|Professional Engineering license]], encouraging engineers to seek Continuing Education Units (CEUs) for their participation in continuing education programs. CEUs readily translate into Professional Development Hours (PDHs), with 1 CEU being equivalent to 10 PDHs. Countries outside the United States, such as South Africa, similarly require continuing professional development (CPD) credits, and it is anticipated that IEEE Expert Now courses will feature in the CPD listing for South Africa.\n\nIEEE also sponsors a website<ref>[http://www.tryengineering.org/ Welcome to TryEngineering.org<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  designed to help young people better understand engineering, and how an engineering career can be made part of their future. Students of age 8\u201318, parents, and teachers can explore the site to prepare for an engineering career, ask experts engineering-related questions, play interactive games, explore curriculum links, and review lesson plans. This website also allows students to search for accredited engineering degree programs in Canada and the United States; visitors are able to search by state/province/territory, country, degree field, tuition ranges, room and board ranges, size of student body, and location (rural, suburban, or urban).\n\nThrough the Student Activities Committee, IEEE facilitates partnership between student activities and all other IEEE entities.<ref>http://www.ieee.org/membership_services/membership/students/activities_committee.html</ref>\n\n==IEEE Conferences==\n\nThe Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers sponsors more than 1,600 annual conferences and meetings worldwide. IEEE is also highly involved in the technical program development of numerous events including trade events, training workshops, job fairs, and other programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/index.html |title=IEEE Conferences & Events |publisher=www.ieee.org |accessdate=2015-10-22}}</ref>\n\n==Standards and development process==\n{{Main article|IEEE Standards Association}}\n\nIEEE is one of the leading [[Technical standard|standard]]s-making organizations in the world.  IEEE performs its standards making and maintaining functions through the [[IEEE Standards Association]] (IEEE-SA).  IEEE standards affect a wide range of industries including: power and energy, biomedical and healthcare, [[Information Technology]] (IT), telecommunications, transportation, nanotechnology, information assurance, and many more.  In 2013, IEEE had over 900 active standards, with over 500 standards under development.  One of the more notable IEEE standards is the [[IEEE 802]] [[LAN]]/[[metropolitan area network|MAN]] group of standards which includes the [[IEEE 802.3]] [[Ethernet]] standard and the [[IEEE 802.11]] Wireless Networking standard.\n\n==Membership and member grades==\nMost IEEE members are electrical and electronics engineers, but the organization's wide scope of interests has attracted people in other disciplines as well (e.g., [[computer science]], [[software engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[civil engineering]], [[biology]], [[physics]], and [[mathematics]]).\n\nAn individual can join the IEEE as a student member, professional member, or associate member. In order to qualify for membership, the individual must fulfill certain academic or professional criteria and abide to the code of ethics and bylaws of the organization. There are several categories and levels of IEEE membership and affiliation:\n\n* '''Student Members''': Student membership is available for a reduced fee to those who are enrolled in an accredited institution of higher education as undergraduate or graduate students in technology or engineering.\n* '''Graduate Student Members''': Graduate Student Membership is discounted but members at this level have greater privileges than do Student Members.\n* '''Members''': Ordinary or professional ''Membership'' requires that the individual have graduated from a technology or engineering program of an appropriately accredited institution of higher education or have demonstrated professional competence in technology or engineering through at least six years of professional work experience. An associate membership is available to an individual whose area of expertise falls outside the scope of the IEEE or who does not, at the time of enrollment, meet all the requirements for full membership. Students and Associates have all the privileges of members, except the right to vote and hold certain offices.\n* '''Society Affiliates''': Some IEEE Societies also allow a person who is not an IEEE member to become a ''Society Affiliate'' of a particular Society within the IEEE, which allows a limited form of participation in the work of a particular IEEE Society.\n* '''Senior Members''': Upon meeting certain requirements, a professional member can apply for ''Senior Membership'', which is the highest level of recognition that a professional member can directly apply for. Applicants for Senior Member must have at least three letters of recommendation from Senior, Fellow, or Honorary members and fulfill other rigorous requirements of education, achievement, remarkable contribution, and experience in the field. The Senior Members are a selected group, and certain IEEE officer positions are available only to Senior (and Fellow) Members. Senior Membership is also one of the requirements for those who are nominated and elevated to the grade ''IEEE Fellow'', a distinctive honor.\n* '''Fellow Members''': The Fellow grade of membership is the highest level of membership, and cannot be applied for directly by the member \u2013 instead the candidate must be nominated by others. This grade of membership is conferred by the IEEE Board of Directors in recognition of a high level of demonstrated extraordinary accomplishment.\n* '''Honorary Members''': Individuals who are not IEEE members but have demonstrated exceptional contributions, such as being a recipient of an [[IEEE Medal of Honor]], may receive ''Honorary Membership'' from the IEEE Board of Directors.\n* '''Life Members''', '''Life Senior Members''' and '''Life Fellows''': Members who have reached the age of 65 and whose number of years of membership plus their age in years adds up to at least 100 are recognized as ''Life Members'', ''Life Senior Members'' or ''Life Fellows'', as appropriate.\n\n==Awards==\nThrough its awards program, the IEEE recognizes contributions that advance the fields of interest to the IEEE. For nearly a century, the IEEE Awards Program has paid tribute to technical professionals whose exceptional achievements and outstanding contributions have made a lasting impact on technology, society and the engineering profession.\n\nFunds for the awards program, other than those provided by corporate sponsors for some awards, are administered by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers#IEEE Foundation|IEEE Foundation]].\n\n===Medals===\n* [[IEEE Medal of Honor]]\n* [[IEEE Edison Medal]]\n* [[IEEE Founders Medal]] (for leadership, planning, and administration)\n* [[IEEE James H.
