The curves form a ''hysteresis loop''.]]\n'''Hysteresis''' is the dependence of the state of a system on its history. For example, a [[magnet]] may have more than one possible [[magnetic moment]] in a given [[magnetic field]], depending on how the field changed in the past. Plots of a single component of the moment often form a loop. This history dependence is the basis of memory in a [[hard disk drive]] and the [[remanence]] that retains a record of the [[Earth's magnetic field]] in the past. Hysteresis occurs in [[ferromagnetic]] and [[ferroelectricity|ferroelectric]] materials, as well as in the [[deformation (mechanics)|deformation]] of [[rubber band]]s and [[shape-memory alloy]]s and many other natural phenomena. In natural systems it is often associated with [[irreversible process|irreversible thermodynamic change]] such as [[phase transitions]] and with [[internal friction]]; and [[dissipation]] is a common side effect.\n\nHysteresis can be found in [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[engineering]], [[biology]] and [[economics]], and so on. It is incorporated in many artificial systems: for example, in [[thermostat]]s and [[Schmitt trigger]]s, it prevents unwanted frequent switching.\n\nHysteresis can be a dynamic [[lag]] between an input and an output that disappears if the input is varied more slowly; this is known as ''rate-dependent'' hysteresis. However, phenomena such as the magnetic hysteresis loops are mainly ''rate-independent'', which makes possible a durable memory.\n\nSystems with hysteresis are [[Nonlinear system|nonlinear]], and can be mathematically challenging to model. Some models such as the [[Preisach model of hysteresis|Preisach model]] (originally applied to ferromagnetism) and the  [[Bouc\u2013Wen model of hysteresis|Bouc-Wen model]] attempt to capture general features of hysteresis; and there are also phenomenological models for particular phenomena such as the [[Jiles-Atherton model]] for ferromagnetism.\n{{TOC limit|depth=2}}\n\n==Etymology and history==\n\nThe term \"hysteresis\" is derived from {{lang|grc|\u1f51\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2}}, an [[ancient Greek]] word meaning \"deficiency\" or \"lagging behind\". It was coined around 1890 by [[James Alfred Ewing|Sir James Alfred Ewing]] to describe the behaviour of magnetic materials.\n\nSome early work on describing hysteresis in mechanical systems was performed by [[James Clerk Maxwell]]. Subsequently, hysteretic models have received significant attention in the works of [[Ferenc Preisach]] ([[Preisach model of hysteresis]]), [[Louis N\u00e9el]] and D. H. Everett in connection with magnetism and absorption. A more formal mathematical theory of systems with hysteresis was developed in the 1970s by a group of Russian mathematicians led by [[Mark Krasnosel'skii]].<ref name=\"Mayergoyz2003\">{{cite book|first=Isaak D.|last= Mayergoyz|title= Mathematical Models of Hysteresis and their Applications: Second Edition (Electromagnetism)|authorlink=Isaak D.

In the [[frequency domain]], input and output are related by a complex ''generalized susceptibility'' that can be computed from <math>\\Phi_d</math>; it is mathematically equivalent to a [[transfer function]] in linear filter theory and analogue signal processing.<ref name=Bertotti1998ch2>{{cite book |last1=Bertotti |first1=Giorgio |title=Hysteresis in magnetism: For physicists, materials scientists, and engineers |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-12-093270-2 |chapter=Ch. 2}}</ref>\n\nThis kind of hysteresis is often referred to as ''rate-dependent hysteresis''. If the input is reduced to zero, the output continues to respond for a finite time. This constitutes a memory of the past, but a limited one because it disappears as the output decays to zero. The phase lag depends on the frequency of the input, and goes to zero as the frequency decreases.<ref name=\"Bertotti1998ch2\" />\n\nWhen rate-dependent hysteresis is due to [[dissipative]] effects like [[friction]], it is associated with [[power loss]].<ref name=\"Bertotti1998ch2\" />\n\n===Rate-independent===\n\nSystems with ''rate-independent hysteresis'' have a ''persistent'' memory of the past that remains after the transients have died out.<ref name=rate>The term is attributed to {{harvnb|Truesdell|Noll|1965}} by {{harvnb|Visintin|1994|loc=page 13}}.</ref> The future development of such a system depends on the history of states visited, but does not fade as the events recede into the past.

For example, a [[thermostat]] controlling a heater may switch the heater on when the temperature drops below A, but not turn it off until the temperature rises above B. (For instance, if one wishes to maintain a temperature of 20&nbsp;\u00b0C then one might set the thermostat to turn the heater on when the temperature drops to below 18&nbsp;\u00b0C and off when the temperature exceeds 22&nbsp;\u00b0C.)\n\nSimilarly, a pressure switch can be designed to exhibit hysteresis, with pressure set-points substituted for temperature thresholds.\n\n===Electronic circuits===\n\n[[Image:Hysteresis sharp curve.svg|thumb|Sharp hysteresis loop of a [[Schmitt trigger]]]]\nOften, some amount of hysteresis is intentionally added to an electronic circuit to prevent unwanted rapid switching. This and similar techniques are used to compensate for [[Switch#Contact bounce|contact bounce]] in switches, or [[Noise (electronic)|noise]] in an electrical signal.\n\nA [[Schmitt trigger]] is a simple electronic circuit that exhibits this property.\n\nA [[Relay#Latching relay|latching relay]] uses a solenoid to actuate a ratcheting mechanism that keeps the relay closed even if power to the relay is terminated.\n\nHysteresis is essential to the workings of some [[memristor]]s (circuit components which \"remember\" changes in the current passing through them by changing their resistance).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=207403521&pgno=1 |title='Missing link' memristor created: Rewrite the textbooks? |last1=Johnson |first1=R. Colin |newspaper=EE Times April 30, 2008 |accessdate=September 2011}}</ref>\n\nHysteresis can be used when connecting arrays of elements such as [[nanoelectronic]]s, [[electrochrome cells]] and [[memory effect]] devices using [[passive matrix addressing]]. Shortcuts are made between adjacent components (see [[crosstalk]]) and the hysteresis helps to keep the components in a particular state while the other components change states. Thus, all rows can be addressed at the same time instead of individually.\n\nIn the field of audio electronics, a [[noise gate]] often implements hysteresis intentionally to prevent the gate from \"chattering\" when signals close to its threshold are applied.\n\n===User interface design===\n\nA hysteresis is sometimes intentionally added to computer algorithms. The field of [[user interface design]] has borrowed the term hysteresis to refer to times when the state of the user interface intentionally lags behind the apparent user input. For example, a menu that was drawn in response to a mouse-over event may remain on-screen for a brief moment after the mouse has moved out of the trigger region and the menu region. This allows the user to move the mouse directly to an item on the menu, even if part of that direct mouse path is outside of both the trigger region and the menu region. For instance, right-clicking on the desktop in most Windows interfaces will create a menu that exhibits this behavior.\n\n===Aerodynamics===\n\nIn aerodynamics, hysteresis can be observed when decreasing the angle of attack of a wing after stall, regarding the lift and drag coefficients. The angle of attack where the flow on top of the wing reattaches is generally lower than the angle of attack where the flow separates during the increase of the angle of attack.<ref>{{cite conference |url=http://www.public.iastate.edu/~huhui/paper/2008/AIAA-2008-0315.pdf |format=pdf |title=An Experimental Investigation on Aerodynamic Hysteresis of a Low-Reynolds Number Airfoil |author=Zifeng Yang |authorlink= |author2=Hirofumi Igarashi |author3=Mathew Martin |author4=Hui Hu |date=Jan 7\u201310, 2008 |publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics |conference=46th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit  |pages= |location=Reno, Nevada |id=AIAA-2008-0315 }}</ref>\n\n==In mechanics==\n\n===Elastic hysteresis===\n[[Image:Elastic Hysteresis.svg|thumb|right|Elastic hysteresis of an idealized rubber band. The area in the centre of the hysteresis loop is the energy dissipated due to internal friction.]]\nIn the elastic hysteresis of rubber, the area in the centre of a hysteresis loop is the energy dissipated due to material [[internal friction]].\n\nElastic hysteresis was one of the first types of hysteresis to be examined.<ref name=\"LoveTreatise\">{{cite book |author=Love, Augustus E. |title=Treatise on the Mathematical Theory of Elasticity (Dover Books on Physics & Chemistry) |publisher=Dover Publications |location=New York |year=1927 |isbn=0-486-60174-9}}</ref><ref name=\"Ewing\">{{cite journal |first1=J.

If the top of a rubber band is hung on a hook and small weights are attached to the bottom of the band one at a time, it will get longer. As more weights are ''loaded'' onto it, the band will continue to extend because the force the weights are exerting on the band is increasing. When each weight is taken off, or ''unloaded'', the band will get shorter as the force is reduced. As the weights are taken off, each weight that produced a specific length as it was loaded onto the band now produces a slightly longer length as it is unloaded. This is because the band does not obey [[Hooke's law]] perfectly. The hysteresis loop of an idealized rubber band is shown in the figure.\n\nIn terms of force, the rubber band was harder to stretch when it was being loaded than when it was being unloaded. In terms of time, when the band is unloaded, the effect (the length) lagged behind the cause(the force of the weights) because the length has not yet reached the value it had for the same weight during the loading part of the cycle. In terms of energy, more energy was required during the loading than the unloading, the excess energy being dissipated as heat.\n\nElastic hysteresis is more pronounced when the loading and unloading is done quickly than when it is done slowly.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=B. |last1=Hopkinson |first2=G. T. |last2=Williams |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society]] |volume= 87 |year=1912 |pages=502 |doi=10.1098/rspa.1912.0104|title=The Elastic Hysteresis of Steel |bibcode = 1912RSPSA..87..502H|issue=598 }}</ref> Some materials such as hard metals don't show elastic hysteresis under a moderate load, whereas other hard materials like granite and marble do. Materials such as rubber exhibit a high degree of elastic hysteresis.\n\nWhen the intrinsic hysteresis of rubber is being measured, the material can be considered to behave like a gas. When a rubber band is stretched it heats up, and if it is suddenly released, it cools down perceptibly. These effects correspond to a large hysteresis from the thermal exchange with the environment and a smaller hysteresis due to internal friction within the rubber. This proper, intrinsic hysteresis can be measured only if the rubber band is adiabatically isolated.\n\nSmall vehicle suspensions using [[rubber]] (or other [[elastomer]]s) can achieve the dual function of springing and damping because rubber, unlike metal springs, has pronounced hysteresis and does not return all the absorbed compression energy on the rebound. [[Mountain bike]]s have made use of elastomer suspension, as did the original [[Mini]] car.\n\nThe primary cause of [[rolling resistance]] when a body (such as a ball, tire, or wheel) rolls on a surface is hysteresis. This is attributed to the [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic characteristics]] of the material of the rolling body.\n\n===Contact angle hysteresis===\nThe [[contact angle]] formed between a liquid and solid phase will exhibit a range of contact angles that are possible. There are two common methods for measuring this range of contact angles. The first method is referred to as the tilting base method. Once a drop is dispensed on the surface with the surface level, the surface is then tilted from 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0. As the drop is tilted, the downhill side will be in a state of imminent wetting while the uphill side will be in a state of imminent dewetting. As the tilt increases the downhill contact angle will increase and represents the advancing contact angle while the uphill side will decrease; this is the receding contact angle. The values for these angles just prior to the drop releasing will typically represent the advancing and receding contact angles. The difference between these two angles is the contact angle hysteresis.\n\nThe second method is often referred to as the add/remove volume method. When the maximum liquid volume is removed from the drop without the [[interfacial area]] decreasing the receding contact angle is thus measured. When volume is added to the maximum before the interfacial area increases, this is the [[advancing contact angle]]. As with the tilt method, the difference between the advancing and receding contact angles is the contact angle hysteresis. Most researchers prefer the tilt method; the add/remove method requires that a tip or needle stay embedded in the drop which can affect the accuracy of the values, especially the receding contact angle.\n\n=== Bubble shape hysteresis ===\nThe equilibrium shapes of [[Bubble (physics)|bubbles]] expanding and contracting on capillaries ([[Hypodermic needle#Non-specialist use|blunt needles]]) can exhibit hysteresis depending on the relative magnitude of the [[Maximum bubble pressure method#Maximum bubble pressure method|maximum capillary pressure]] to ambient pressure, and the relative magnitude of the bubble volume at the maximum capillary pressure to the dead volume in the system.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Chandran Suja|first=V.|last2=Frostad|first2=J.

During expansion, bubbles undergo large non equilibrium jumps in volume, while during contraction the bubbles are more stable and undergo a relatively smaller jump in volume resulting in an asymmetry across expansion and contraction. The bubble shape hysteresis is qualitatively similar to the adsorption hysteresis, and as in the contact angle hysteresis, the interfacial properties play an important role in bubble shape hysteresis.\n\nThe existence of the bubble shape hysteresis has important consequences in [[Surface rheology|interfacial rheology]] experiments involving bubbles. As a result of the hysteresis, not all sizes of the bubbles can be formed on a capillary. Further the gas compressibility causing  the hysteresis leads to unintended complications in the phase relation between the applied changes in interfacial area to the expected interfacial stresses. These difficulties can be avoided by designing experimental systems to avoid the bubble shape hysteresis.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Alvarez|first=Nicolas J.|last2=Walker|first2=Lynn M.|last3=Anna|first3=Shelley L.|date=2010-08-17|title=A Microtensiometer To Probe the Effect of Radius of Curvature on Surfactant Transport to a Spherical Interface|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/la101870m|journal=Langmuir|volume=26|issue=16|pages=13310\u201313319|doi=10.1021/la101870m|issn=0743-7463}}</ref>\n\n===Adsorption hysteresis===\nHysteresis can also occur during physical [[adsorption]] processes. In this type of hysteresis, the quantity adsorbed is different when gas is being added than it is when being removed. The specific causes of adsorption hysteresis are still an active area of research, but it is linked to differences in the nucleation and evaporation mechanisms inside mesopores. These mechanisms are further complicated by effects such as [[cavitation]] and pore blocking.\n\nIn physical adsorption, hysteresis is evidence of [[mesoporosity]]-indeed, the definition of mesopores (2\u201350&nbsp;nm) is associated with the appearance (50&nbsp;nm) and disappearance (2&nbsp;nm) of mesoporosity in nitrogen adsorption isotherms as a function of Kelvin radius.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gregg |first1=S.

[[Matric potential]] measurements (\u03a8<sub>m</sub>) are converted to volumetric water content (\u03b8) measurements based on a site or soil specific calibration curve. Hysteresis is a source of water content measurement error. Matric potential hysteresis arises from differences in wetting behaviour causing dry medium to re-wet; that is, it depends on the saturation history of the porous medium. Hysteretic behaviour means that, for example, at a matric potential (\u03a8<sub>m</sub>) of {{nowrap|5 kPa}}, the volumetric water content (\u03b8) of a fine sandy soil matrix could be anything between 8% to 25%.<ref>{{cite mailing list |url=http://www.sowacs.com/archives/99-04/msg00000.html |title=Subject: Accuracy of capacitance soil moisture ... |date=8 April 1999 |accessdate=28 September 2011 |mailinglist=SOWACS |last1=Parkes |first1=Martin}}</ref>\n\n[[Tensiometer (soil science)|Tensiometer]]s are directly influenced by this type of hysteresis. Two other types of sensors used to measure soil water matric potential are also influenced by hysteresis effects within the sensor itself. Resistance blocks, both nylon and gypsum based, measure matric potential as a function of electrical resistance. The relation between the sensor\u2019s electrical resistance and sensor matric potential is hysteretic. Thermocouples measure matric potential as a function of heat dissipation. Hysteresis occurs because measured heat dissipation depends on sensor water content, and the sensor water content\u2013matric potential relationship is hysteretic. {{As of|2002}}, only desorption curves are usually measured during calibration of [[soil moisture sensors]]. Despite the fact that it can be a source of significant error, the sensor specific effect of hysteresis is generally ignored.<ref>{{cite journal\n|last1 = Scanlon\n|first1= B.

In general, the magnetization varies (in direction but not magnitude) across a magnet, but in sufficiently small magnets, it does not. In these [[Single domain (magnetic)|single-domain]] magnets, the magnetization responds to a magnetic field by rotating. Single-domain magnets are used wherever a strong, stable magnetization is needed (for example, [[magnetic recording]]).\n\nLarger magnets are divided into regions called ''domains''. Across each domain, the magnetization does not vary; but between domains are relatively thin ''domain walls'' in which the direction of magnetization rotates from the direction of one domain to another. If the magnetic field changes, the walls move, changing the relative sizes of the domains. Because the domains are not magnetized in the same direction, the [[magnetic moment]] per unit volume is smaller than it would be in a single-domain magnet; but domain walls involve rotation of only a small part of the magnetization, so it is much easier to change the magnetic moment. The magnetization can also change by addition or subtraction of domains (called ''nucleation'' and ''denucleation'').\n\n====Magnetic hysteresis models====\nThe most known empirical models in hysteresis are [[Preisach model of hysteresis|Preisach]] and [[Jiles-Atherton model]]s. These models allow an accurate modeling of the hysteresis loop and are widely used in the industry. However, these models lose the connection with thermodynamics and the energy consistency is not ensured. Last models rely on a consistent thermodynamic formulation. VINCH model<ref>Vincent Francois-Lavet et al (2011-11-14). [http://vincent.francois-l.be/VINCH_model.pdf Vectorial Incremental Nonconservative Consistent Hysteresis model].</ref> is inspired by the [[Work hardening|kinematic hardening]] laws and by the [[thermodynamics]] of [[irreversible process]]es. In particular, in addition to provide an accurate modeling, the stored magnetic energy and the dissipated energy are known at all times. The obtained incremental formulation is variationally consistent, i.e., all internal variables follow from the minimization of a thermodynamic potential. That allows to obtain easily a vectorial model while Preisach and Jiles-Atherton are fundamentally scalar models.\n\n====Applications====\n{{Main article|Magnet#Common uses of magnets}}\n\nThere are a great variety of applications of the hysteresis in ferromagnets. Many of these make use of their ability to retain a memory, for example [[magnetic tape]], [[hard disks]], and [[credit card]]s. In these applications, ''hard'' magnets (high coercivity) like [[iron]] are desirable so the memory is not easily erased.\n\n''Soft'' magnets (low coercivity) are used as cores in [[electromagnet]]s. The nonlinear response of the magnetic moment to a magnetic field boosts the response of the coil wrapped around it. The low coercivity reduces that energy loss associated with hysteresis.\n\n===Electrical hysteresis===\n\nElectrical hysteresis typically occurs in [[ferroelectric]] material, where domains of polarization contribute to the total polarization. Polarization is the [[electrical dipole moment]] (either [[coulomb|C]]\u00b7[[metre|m]]<SUP>\u22122</SUP> or [[coulomb|C]]\u00b7[[metre|m]]). The mechanism, an organization of the polarization into domains, is similar to that of magnetic hysteresis.\n\n===Liquid\u2013solid-phase transitions===\nHysteresis manifests itself in state transitions when [[melting point|melting temperature]] and freezing temperature do not agree. For example, [[agar]] melts at 85 [[Celsius|\u00b0C]] and solidifies from 32 to 40&nbsp;\u00b0C. This is to say that once agar is melted at 85&nbsp;\u00b0C, it retains a liquid state until cooled to 40&nbsp;\u00b0C. Therefore, from the temperatures of 40 to 85&nbsp;\u00b0C, agar can be either solid or liquid, depending on which state it was before.\n\n==In biology==\n\n===Cell biology and genetics===\n{{Main article|Cell biology}}\nCells undergoing [[cell division]] exhibit hysteresis in that it takes a higher concentration of [[cyclin]]s to switch them from G2 phase into [[mitosis]] than to stay in mitosis once begun.<ref>{{cite journal\n|first1 = Joseph R.\n|last1=Pomerening\n|first2= Eduardo D.\n|last2=Sontag\n|first3= James E.\n|last3=Ferrell\n|year = 2003\n|title = Building a cell cycle oscillator: hysteresis and bistability in the activation of Cdc2\n|journal = Nature Cell Biology\n|pmid = 12629549\n|volume = 5\n|issue = 4\n|pages = 346&ndash;251\n|doi = 10.1038/ncb954}}</ref>\n\n{{Main article|Chromatin}}\nDarlington in his classic works on [[genetics]]<ref>{{cite book |last1=Darlington |first1=C.

Notable examples include the theory of spruce budworm outbreaks and behavioral-effects on disease transmission.\n\n==In economics==\n{{main article|Hysteresis (economics)}}\nEconomic systems can exhibit hysteresis. For example, [[export]] performance is subject to strong hysteresis effects: because of the fixed transportation costs it may take a big push to start a country's exports, but once the transition is made, not much may be required to keep them going.\n\nWhen some negative shock reduces employment in a company or industry, fewer employed workers then remain. As usually the employed workers have the power to set wages, their reduced number incentivizes them to bargain for even higher wages when the economy again gets better instead of letting the wage be at the [[equilibrium wage]] level, where the supply and demand of workers would match. This causes hysteresis: the unemployment becomes permanently higher after negative shocks.<ref name=Ball/><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w1950 |title=Hysteresis and the European Unemployment Problem |first1=Olivier J. |last1=Blanchard |first2=Lawrence H. |last2=Summers |journal=NBER Macroeconomics Annual |volume=1 |year= 1986 |pages=15&ndash;78 |doi=10.2307/3585159}}</ref>\n\n===Permanently higher unemployment===\n\nThe idea of hysteresis is used extensively in the area of labor economics, specifically with reference to the [[unemployment rate]].<ref name=Hargreaves-Heap>S.P. Hargreaves Heap (1980).[http://www.jstor.org/stable/2231931?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents \"Choosing the Wrong `Natural' Rate: Accelerating Inflation or Decelerating Employment and Growth?\"] The Economic Journal Vol. 90, No. 359 (Sep., 1980), pp. 611-620.</ref> According to theories based on hysteresis, severe economic downturns (recession) and/or persistent stagnation (slow demand growth, usually after a recession) cause unemployed individuals to lose their job skills (commonly developed on the job) or to find them become obsolete or become demotivated/disillusioned/depressed or lose job-seeking skills. In addition, employers may use time spent in unemployment as a screening tool, i.e., to weed out less desired employees in hiring decisions. Then, in times of an economic upturn, recovery, or 'boom', the affected workers will not share in the prosperity, remaining unemployed for long periods (e.g., over 52 weeks). This makes unemployment \"structural,\" i.e., extremely difficult to reduce simply by increasing the aggregate demand for products and labor without causing increased inflation.  That is, it is possible that a [[ratchet effect]] in unemployment rates exists, so a short-term rise in unemployment rates tend to persist. For example, traditional anti-inflationary policy (the use of recession to fight inflation) leads to a permanently higher 'natural' rate of unemployment (more scientifically known as the [[NAIRU]]). This occurs first because inflationary expectations are '[[sticky (economics)|sticky]]' downward due to wage and price rigidities (and so adapt slowly over time rather than being approximately correct as in theories of [[rational expectations]]) and second because labor markets do not clear instantly in response to unemployment.\n\nThe existence of hysteresis has been put forward as a possible explanation for the persistently high unemployment of many economies in the 1990s. Hysteresis has been invoked by [[Olivier Blanchard]] among others to explain the differences in long run unemployment rates between Europe and the United States. Labor market reform (usually meaning institutional change promoting more flexible wages, firing, and hiring) or strong demand-side economic growth may not therefore reduce this pool of long-term unemployed. Thus, specific targeted training programs are presented as a possible policy solution.<ref name=Ball>Ball, Laurence M. (2009) [http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ball/w14818.pdf \"Hysteresis in Unemployment: Old and New Evidence\"], US National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) Working Paper No. 14818</ref> However, the hysteresis hypothesis suggests such training programs are aided by persistently high demand for products (perhaps with [[incomes policies]] to avoid increased inflation), which reduces the transition costs out of unemployment and into paid employment easier.\n\n===Game theory===\nHysteresis occurs in applications of [[game theory]] to economics, in models with product quality, agent honesty or corruption of various institutions. Slightly different initial conditions can lead to opposite outcomes and resulting stable good and bad [[Correlated equilibrium|equilibria]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n==In law==\nWhen hysteresis was first applied to the law, it was understood as the sluggishness in the production of international rules.<ref>R.

One of the consequences of legal hysteresis is private ordering. In this context, by \u2018private ordering\u2019 neither one means the spontaneous enforcement of agreements (usually due to the so-called reputational mechanism), nor the abuse of contracts in order to elude the law. One means that, as a response to a legislator that intervenes always too late, trapped in old legal categories, there are many regulating gaps when it comes to technology and these gaps are filled by the contracts.<ref>Guido NOTO LA DIEGA, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2682489 ''In light of the ends.
