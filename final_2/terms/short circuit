It is common to misuse \"short circuit\" to describe any electrical malfunction, regardless of the actual problem.\n\n== Definition ==\nA short circuit is an abnormal connection between two nodes of an electric circuit intended to be at different voltages. This results in an excessive [[electric current]]  limited only by the [[Th\u00e9venin's theorem|Th\u00e9venin equivalent resistance]] of the rest of the network and potentially causes circuit damage, [[Overheating (electricity)|overheating]], [[fire]] or [[explosion]]. Although usually the result of a fault, there are cases where short circuits are caused intentionally, for example, for the purpose of voltage-sensing [[Crowbar (circuit)|crowbar circuit protectors]].\n\nIn [[circuit analysis]], a ''short circuit'' is a connection between two nodes that forces them to be at the same voltage. In an ideal short circuit, this means there is no resistance and no voltage drop across the short. In real circuits, the result is a connection with almost no resistance. In such a case, the current is limited by the rest of the circuit.\n\n== Examples ==\nA common type of short circuit occurs when the positive and negative terminals of a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] are connected with a low-[[electrical resistance|resistance]] [[Electrical conductor|conductor]], like a [[wire]].  With low resistance in the connection, a high [[Current (electricity)|current]] exists, causing the cell to deliver a large amount of [[energy]] in a short time.\n\nA large current through a battery can cause the rapid buildup of heat, potentially resulting in an explosion or the release of [[hydrogen]] gas and [[electrolyte]] (an [[acid]] or a [[base (chemistry)|base]]), which can burn tissue, cause blindness or even death. Overloaded wires can also [[Overheating (electricity)|overheat]], sometimes causing damage to the wire's insulation, or a fire.  High current conditions may also occur with [[electric motor]] loads under stalled conditions, such as when the impeller of an electrically driven [[pump]] is jammed by debris; this is not a short, though it may have some similar effects.\n\nIn electrical devices unintentional short circuits are usually caused when a wire's [[Electrical insulation|insulation]] breaks down, or when another conducting material is introduced, allowing charge to flow along a different path than the one intended.\n\nIn [[Mains electricity|mains]] circuits, short circuits may occur between two [[Polyphase system|phases]], between a phase and [[Ground and neutral|neutral]] or between a phase and [[Ground and neutral|earth]] (ground).  Such short circuits are likely to result in a very high current and therefore quickly trigger an overcurrent protection device. However, it is possible for short circuits to arise between neutral and earth conductors, and between two conductors of the same phase. Such short circuits can be dangerous, particularly as they may not immediately result in a large current and are therefore less likely to be detected. Possible effects include unexpected energisation of a circuit presumed to be isolated. To help reduce the negative effects of short circuits, power distribution transformers are deliberately designed to have a certain amount of [[Leakage inductance|leakage reactance]]. The leakage reactance (usually about 5 to 10% of the full load impedance) helps limit both the magnitude and rate of rise of the fault current.\n\nA short circuit may lead to formation of an [[electric arc]]. The arc, a channel of hot ionized [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], is highly conductive and can persist even after significant amount of original material of the conductors was evaporated. Surface erosion is a typical sign of electric arc damage. Even short arcs can remove significant amount of materials from the electrodes. The temperature of the resulting electrical arc is very high (tens of thousands of degrees Fahrenheit), causing the metal on the contact surfaces to melt, pool and migrate with the current, as well as to escape into the air as fine particulate matter.<ref>{{cite web | title = Lab Note #105 ''Contact Life - Unsuppressed vs. Suppressed Arcing'' | author=  | publisher = Arc Suppression Technologies | date = April 2011 | url = http://www.arcsuppressiontechnologies.com/arc-suppression-facts/lab-app-notes/ | accessdate = February 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Damage ==\nA short circuit fault current can, within milliseconds, be thousands of times larger than the normal operating current of the system. Damage from short circuits can be reduced or prevented by employing [[Fuse (electrical)|fuses]], [[circuit breaker]]s, or other [[overload protection]], which disconnect the power in reaction to excessive current.  Overload protection must be chosen according to the current rating of the circuit.  Circuits for large [[home appliance]]s  require protective devices set or rated for higher currents than lighting circuits. [[Wire gauge]]s specified in building and electrical [[building code|codes]] are chosen to ensure safe operation in conjunction with the overload protection. An overcurrent protection device must be rated to safely interrupt the maximum [[prospective short circuit current]].\n\nIn an improper installation, the overcurrent from a short circuit may cause [[ohmic heating]] of the circuit parts with poor conductivity (faulty joints in wiring, faulty contacts in power sockets, or even the site of the short circuit itself). Such [[Overheating (electricity)|overheating]] is a common cause of [[fire]]s. An electric arc, if it forms during the short circuit, produces high amount of heat and can cause ignition of combustible substances as well.\n\nIn industrial and utility distribution systems, dynamic forces generated by high short circuit currents cause conductors to spread apart. Busbars, cables, and apparatus can be damaged by the forces generated in a short circuit.\n\n== Related concepts ==\nIn [[electronics]], the ideal model (infinite [[Gain (electronics)|gain]]) of an [[operational amplifier]] is said to produce a ''virtual short circuit'' between its input terminals because no matter what the output voltage is, the [[difference of potential]] between its input terminals is zero. If one of the input terminals is connected to the ground, then the other one is said to provide a [[virtual ground]] because its potential is (ideally) identical to that of the ground.<ref>{{cite book|title=Basic Electronics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_zytO-iXdxUC&pg=PA184 |accessdate=20 April 2011 |publisher=I.
