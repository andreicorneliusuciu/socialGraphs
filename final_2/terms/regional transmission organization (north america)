The transfer of electricity between states is considered interstate commerce and electric grids spanning multiple states are therefore regulated by the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] (FERC).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/824|title=16 U.S. Code \u00a7 824|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> The voluntary creation of RTOs was initiated by FERC Order No. 2000, issued on December 20, 1999.<ref>https://www.ferc.gov/legal/maj-ord-reg/land-docs/RM99-2A.pdf</ref> The purpose of the RTO is to promote economic efficiency, reliability and non-discriminatory practices while reducing government oversight. \n\nAn '''independent system operator''' ('''ISO''') is similarly an organization formed at the recommendation of the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] (FERC).  In the areas where an ISO is established, it coordinates, controls and monitors the operation of the [[electric power transmission|electrical power]] system, usually within a single [[United States|US]] State, but sometimes encompassing multiple states.  RTOs typically perform the same functions as ISOs, but cover a larger geographic area.\n\nThe two are similar, with an RTO being more clearly defined and born out of the concept of electrical grid reliability. The delineation between an ISO and an RTO is subtle to some and quite specific to others as the similarities in the table below illustrate:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+Various definitions from web-based glossaries\n|-\n!width=\"300\"|ISO\n!width=\"300\"|RTO\n|-\n| <small>''\"...an organization formed at the direction or recommendation of the [FERC]...\"''</small>\n| <small>''\"...designated by the [FERC] to direct operation of the regional electric transmission grid in its area...\"''</small>\n|-\n| <small>''\"...a neutral party responsible for the management and control of the electric transmission grid in a state or region...\"''</small>\n| <small>''\"...coordinates, controls and monitors an electricity transmission grid that is larger with much higher voltages than the typical power company's distribution grid...\"''</small>\n|-\n| <small>''\"...operates an electric-transmission system that it does not own...\"''</small>\n| <small>''\"...coordinates power generation and transmission within an integrated regional market...\"''</small>\n|-\n| <small>''\"...an independent, Federally regulated entity...\"''</small>\n| <small>''\"...an independent governing body...\"''</small>\n|-\n| <small>''\"...ensure[s] the safety and reliability of the electric system...\"''</small>\n| <small>''\"...[responsible] for electric transmission grid operations, short-term electric reliability and transmission services within a multi-state region...\"''</small>\n|-\n| <small>''\"...for the purpose of providing open access to retail and wholesale markets for supply...\"''</small>\n| <small>''\"...serve as the independent operator of the regional electric market...\"''</small>\n|-\n|}\nIn short, an ISO operates a region's electricity grid, administers the region's wholesale electricity markets, and provides reliability planning for the region's bulk electricity system.

Subsequently, in Order No. 2000, the Commission encouraged the voluntary formation of Regional Transmission Organizations to administer the transmission grid on a regional basis throughout North America (including Canada). Order No. 2000 delineated twelve characteristics and functions that an entity must satisfy in order to become a Regional Transmission Organization.\"''</small><ref name=\"ferc\">[http://www.ferc.gov/industries/electric/indus-act/rto.asp RTO/ISO Section, FERC.gov], Updated: August 20, 2009</ref>\n|}\n\n===FERC Orders 888 & 889===\nIn April, 1996, the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission|Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)]] issued two orders that changed the landscape of how electricity is generated, transmitted, and distributed throughout the North America. Prior to these rulings, generated power and the subsequent energy provided to customers by local service providers, was owned and controlled by single entities who often owned the entire generation, transmission, and distribution assets. Because these companies controlled the retail delivery of the energy from generation through their own power lines, consumers had little to no choice regarding whose electricity they were buying.\n\nIn economic terms, this structure constituted an impediment for new providers who would want to generate power, move energy, or provide retail electricity to individual consumers.\n\nOrder No. 888<ref name=\"FO888\">[http://www.ferc.gov/legal/maj-ord-reg/land-docs/order888.asp Order No. 888, Timeline, FERC.gov]</ref> addressed \"Promoting Wholesale Competition Through Open Access Non-discriminatory Transmission Services by Public Utilities; Recovery of Stranded Costs by Public Utilities and Transmitting Utilities.\" and Order No. 889<ref name=\"FO889\">[http://www.ferc.gov/legal/maj-ord-reg/land-docs/order889.asp Order No. 889, Timeline, FERC.gov]</ref> added and amended existing rules \"...establishing and governing an Open Access Same-time Information System (OASIS) (formerly real-time information networks) and prescribing standards of conduct.\"\n\n====Order No. 888====\nOrder No. 888, is often cited as the \"Deregulation\" of the electric industry; deregulation, however, is not an accurate term. In actuality, the electricity industry is still regulated (depending on the region) by a series of federal, state, and local agencies and various public commissions.  Order No. 888 is substantial in scope.  Relative to this article, however, it defined two key elements:\n# An acknowledgment that barriers to competitive wholesale markets may exist and that those barriers must be removed\n# Permit utilities to recover stranded costs associated with providing open access to transmission\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n|width=\"800\"|<small>''\"The legal and policy cornerstone of these rules is to remedy undue discrimination in access to the monopoly owned transmission wires that control whether and to whom electricity can be transported in interstate commerce.  A second critical aspect of the rules is to address recovery of the transition costs of moving from a monopoly-regulated regime to one in which all sellers can compete on a fair basis and in which electricity is more competitively priced.\"''</small><ref name=\"FO888fr\">[http://www.ferc.gov/legal/maj-ord-reg/land-docs/rm95-8-00w.txt Order No. 888, Final Rule, FERC.gov]</ref>\n|}\n<br />\nIn addressing #1 above, Order No. 888 defined the fundamental purpose of an ISO to \u201c\u2026operate the transmission systems of public utilities in a manner that is independent of any business interest in sales or purchases of electric power by those utilities.\u201d<ref name=\"FO888A\">[http://www.ferc.gov/legal/maj-ord-reg/land-docs/rm95-8p1-000.txt Order No. 888-A, Reaffirmation, FERC.gov]</ref> The order, however, did not mandate or require the establishment of ISOs. Rather, in an attempt to comply with the FERC\u2019s order, groups of participants (or \u201cPower Pools\u201d composed of generators, transmission providers and utilities) partnered, and proposed to the FERC, for the right to establish designs of independent system operations. Through negotiation, collaboration and legal challenges, the first ISOs to emerge included California ISO, PJM Interconnection, New York ISO and New England ISO.<ref name=\"FO888A\" /> Each proposed a slightly different market design according to their collaborative results. In order to facilitate competitive wholesale markets, Order No. 888 specified the unbundling of a utility\u2019s operations separating generation and transmission and distribution.<br />\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n|width=\"800\"|<small>''\"\u2026 all public utilities that own, operate or control interstate transmission facilities to offer network and point-to- point transmission services (and ancillary services) to all eligible buyers and sellers in wholesale bulk power markets, and to take transmission service for their own uses under the same rates, terms and conditions offered to others. In other words, it requires non-discriminatory (comparable) treatment for all eligible users of the monopolists' transmission facilities. The non-discriminatory services required by Order No. 888, known as open access services, are reflected in a pro forma open access tariff contained in the Rule. The Rule also requires functional separation of the utilities' transmission and power marketing functions (also referred to as functional unbundling) and the adoption of an electric transmission system information network.\"''</small><ref name=\"FO888A\" />\n|}<br />\nIn addressing #2 above, the original order (and subsequent clarification by the FERC) allows utilities, under certain defined circumstances, to seek extra-contractual recovery of stranded costs. The FERC continues to receive rehearing petitions regarding stranded cost recovery as it has clearly placed the importance on remedying what it terms as \u201cundue discrimination\u201d at the forefront.<ref name=\"FO888A\" />\n\nIt is important to note that Order No. 888 was not met without objection among the public, academics and industry participants. Requests for rehearing and/or clarification were filed by 137 entities after the order\u2019s issuance. The majority agreed with the FERC\u2019s assertion for the need to harness the benefits of competitive electricity markets.<ref name=\"FO888A\" />\n\n====Order No. 889====\nOrder No. 889, amended rules establishing and governing the [[Open Access Same-Time Information System|Open Access Same-time Information System (OASIS)]] (formerly real-time information networks) and prescribed standards of conduct for its use and access.

The order also stated its commitment toward open architecture with a stated goal that an RTO \"...be designed so that they can evolve over time.\"<ref name=\"FO2000fr\" /> The order still, however, does not mandate that a new entity called an RTO be created, nor does it mandate that an entity call itself an RTO to comply with the FERC's order.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n|width=\"800\"|<small>''\"In the Final Rule, we noted that the characteristics and functions could be satisfied by different organizational forms, such as ISOs, transcos, combinations of the two, or even new organizational forms not yet discussed in the industry or proposed to the Commission.

In the areas where an ISO is established, it coordinates, controls and monitors the operation of the [[electric power transmission|electrical power]] system, usually within a single [[United States|US]] State, but sometimes encompassing multiple states.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n|width=\"800\"|<small>''\"The PJM, New England and New York ISOs were established on the platform of existing tight power pools. It appears that the principal motivation for creating ISOs in these situations was the Order No. 888 requirement that there be a single systemwide transmission tariff for tight pools. In contrast, the establishment of the California ISO and the ERCOT ISO was the direct result of mandates by state governments. The Midwest ISO, which is not yet operational, is unique. It was neither required by government nor based on an existing institution. Two states in the region subsequently required utilities in their states to participate in either a Commission-approved ISO (Illinois and Wisconsin), or sell their transmission assets to an independent transmission company that would operate under a regional ISO (Wisconsin).\"''</small><ref name=\"FO2000fr\" />\n|}\n\nSimilar to an RTO, the primary difference being that ISOs either do not meet the minimum requirements specified by FERC to hold the designation of RTO or that the ISO has not petitioned FERC for the status.\n\nElectric utilities that are located within the United States and engage in interstate commerce fall under FERC authority. Not all utilities are members of ISOs. All utilities and ISOs, however, are responsible to meet the compliance of a larger organization called the [[North American Electric Reliability Corporation|North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC)]] which overlays the entire FERC footprint and also includes a Mexican utility and several Canadian utilities.  As such, international reciprocity is commonplace, and rules or recommendations introduced by FERC often are voluntarily accepted by NERC members outside of FERC\u2019s jurisdiction.  Therefore, one Canadian Province is a member of a US-based RTO, while two others function as an Electric System Operator (ESO), an organization essentially equal to a US-based ISO.\n\nWithin the United States one ISO, and its participating utilities, does not fall under FERC authority: The [[Electric Reliability Council of Texas|Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT)]]. ERCOT does fall under the authority of NERC and operates a reliability function, separate from its market function, in order to comply with NERC requirements.\n\nISOs act as a [[marketplace]] operator in [[wholesale]] power, resulting from FERC order No. 888.  Most are set up as [[nonprofit]] [[corporation]]s using governance models approved by FERC and/or regional or local commissions.\n\nThere are regions of the United States where ISOs do not exist and, subsequently, the utilities do not engage in wholesale power markets. The Pacific Northwest, and states east of California and west of the Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas and Texas largely do not participate. The majority of Southeastern states also do not participate in wholesale markets. While these regions must conform to open access as mandated by FERC, the power exchanges between utilities is mostly facilitated through [[bilateral contract]]s and [[power purchase agreement]]s\n\n===Current ISOs===\n\nThere are currently 7 ISOs within North America:<ref name=\"ferc\" />\n* [[California Independent System Operator]] - California ISO\n* [[NYISO]] - New York ISO\n* [[Electric Reliability Council of Texas|Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT)]]; also a Regional Reliability Council\n* [[Midcontinent Independent System Operator]] - Midcontinent ISO\n* [[ISO-NE]] - ISO New England\n* [[AESO]] - Alberta Electric System Operator\n* [[Independent Electricity System Operator| Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO)]]; operates the [[Hydro One]] transmission grid for [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]\n\nThe New Brunswick System Operator ([[NBSO]]) was dissolved when New Brunswick\u2019s new ''Electricity Act'' went into effect on October 1, 2013.<ref>http://www.gnb.ca/legis/bill/file/57/3/bill-39-e.htm</ref>\n\n==Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs)==\nAn RTO is an organization formed at the approval of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). In the areas where an RTO is established, it coordinates, controls and monitors the operation of the electrical power system, usually within a single US State, but sometimes encompassing multiple states. The official definition for an RTO: \"An entity that is independent from all generation and power marketing interests and has exclusive responsibility for grid operations, short-term reliability, and transmission service within a region.\"<ref name=\"PJMt\">[http://www.pjm.com/training.aspx PJM Training]</ref><br />\nThe designation of an RTO is largely one of scope. In addition, an organization wanting to achieve RTO status must petition the FERC for approval and meet 4 minimum characteristics and 8 minimum functions:<ref name=\"FO2000fr\" /><ref>[http://www.ferc.gov/legal/maj-ord-reg/land-docs/RM99-2A.pdf http://www.ferc.gov/legal/maj-ord-reg/land-docs/RM99-2A.pdf]</ref>\n\n===Characteristics===\n\n#Independence \u2013 an RTO should be independent from its market participants in financial interests, decision-making, and tariff-setting. \n#Scope and regional configuration \u2013 the region for an RTO should be chosen to achieve the necessary regulatory, reliability, operational, and competitive benefits.\n#Operational authority \u2013 an RTO must have the authority to control its transmission facilities (e.g. switching elements in and out of service, monitoring and controlling voltage) and must be the security coordinator for its region. \n#Short-term reliability \u2013 an RTO must ensure the region meets the NERC reliability standards or alert FERC if it does not.\n\n===Functions<ref name=\"FO2000fr\" />===\n\n#Tariff administration and design \u2013 in order to ensure non-discriminatory transmission service, an RTO must be the sole provider of transmission service and sole administrator of its own open access tariff.\n#Congestion management \u2013 an RTO must ensure the development and operation of market mechanisms to manage transmission congestion.\n#Parallel path flow \u2013 an RTO must develop and implement procedures to address parallel path flow issues within its region and with other regions.\n#Ancillary services \u2013 an RTO must serve as the supplier of last resort for all ancillary services and determine if the minimum amount of ancillary services have been supplied according to FERC Order No. 888.\n#OASIS and Total Transmission Capability (TTC) and Available Transmission Capability (ATC) \u2013 an RTO must be the single OASIS site administrator for all transmission facilities under its control and independently calculate TTC and ATC.\n#Market monitoring \u2013 an RTO must monitor market behavior and report market power abuses and market design flaws to FERC.\n#Planning and expansion \u2013 an RTO must have ultimate responsibility for both transmission planning and expansion within its region that will enable it to provide efficient, reliable and non-discriminatory service.\n#Interregional coordination \u2013 an RTO must  coordinate its activities with other regions.\n\nOnly electric utilities that are located within the [[United States]] fall under FERC authority, but a larger organization called the [[North American Electric Reliability Corporation]] (NERC) overlays the entire FERC footprint and also includes a [[Mexico|Mexican]] utility and several [[Canada|Canadian]] utilities.  As such, international reciprocity is commonplace, and rules or recommendations introduced by FERC often are voluntarily accepted by NERC members outside of FERC\u2019s jurisdiction.  Therefore, one Canadian Province is a member of a U.S.-based RTO, while two others function as an Electric System Operator (ESO), an organization essentially equal to a U.S.-based ISO.\n\nSome ISOs and RTOs also act as a [[marketplace]] in [[wholesale]] power, especially since the [[electricity market]] [[deregulation]] of the late 1990s.  Most are set up as [[nonprofit]] [[corporation]]s using governance models developed by FERC.\n\nFERC Orders 888 and 889 defined how independent power producers (IPPs) and power marketers would be allowed fair access to transmission systems, and mandated the implementation of the  [[Open Access Same-Time Information System]] (OASIS) to facilitate the fair handling of transactions between electric power transmission suppliers and their customers.\n\nTSOs in [[Europe]] cross state and provincial borders like RTOs.\n\n===History of RTOs===\nRTOs were created by the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] (FERC) as a way to handle the challenges associated with the operation of multiple interconnected [[independent power supply]] companies. FERC describes this as a voluntary system. The traditional model of the [[vertically integrated]] [[electric utility]] with a transmission system designed to serve its own customers worked extremely well for decades. As dependence on a reliable supply of electricity grew and electricity was transported over increasingly greater distances, [[power pool]]s were formed and [[wide area synchronous grid|interconnections]] developed. Transactions were relatively few and generally planned well in advance.\n\nHowever, in the last decade of the 20th century, some policy makers and academics projected that the [[electrical power industry]] would ultimately experience [[deregulation]], and RTOs were conceived as the way to handle the vastly increased number of transactions that take place in a competitive environment. About a dozen states decided to deregulate but some pulled back following the [[California electricity crisis]] of 2000 and 2001.\n\nRTOs ensure three key free marketer drives: open access and non-discriminatory services, the continued reliability of a system unequalled anywhere else, and multiple transmission charges that will not negate the savings to the end-use customer. Critics of RTOs counter that the [[wholesale]] [[electricity market]] as operated through the RTOs is in fact raising prices beyond what would obtain in a truly competitive situation, and that the organizations themselves add a needless layer of bureaucracy. {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nThe RTO concept provides for separation of [[electricity generation|generation]] and transmission and elimination of pancaked rates, and it encourages a diverse membership including public power. Wider membership contributes to the establishment of an entity with the size necessary to function as an RTO.\n\n===Purpose===\nIn the 1990s, as states and regions in the United States established wholesale competition for electricity, groups of [[electric utility|utilities]] and their federal and state regulators began forming independent transmission operators that would ensure equal access to the power grid for non-utility firms, enhance the reliability of the transmission system and operate wholesale electricity markets. Today, seven of these grid operators, either independent system operators (ISOs) or RTOs, coordinate the power grid to ensure the reliable delivery of two-thirds of the electricity used in the United States to two-thirds of its population. Most are overseen by FERC.\n\nISOs and RTOs coordinate generation and transmission across wide geographic regions, matching generation to the load instantaneously to keep [[energy demand management|supply and demand for electricity]] in balance. The grid operators forecast load and schedule generation to assure that sufficient generation and back-up power is available in case demand rises or a [[power plant]] or [[power line]] is lost. They also operate wholesale electricity markets that enable participants to buy and sell electricity on a day-ahead or a real-time [[spot market]] basis. These markets provide electricity suppliers with more options for meeting consumer needs for power at the lowest possible cost.\n\nISO/RTOs provide non-discriminatory transmission access, facilitating competition among wholesale suppliers to improve transmission service and provide fair electricity prices. Across large regions, they schedule the use of transmission lines; manage the interconnection of new generation and monitor the markets to ensure fairness and neutrality for all participants. Providing these services regionally is more efficient than providing them on a smaller-scale, utility by utility.\n\nToday\u2019s power industry is far more than a collection of power plants and transmission lines. Maintaining an effective grid requires management of three different but related sets of flows \u2013 the flow of energy across the grid; the exchange of information about power flows and the equipment it moves across; and the flow of money between producers, marketers, transmission owners, buyers and others. ISO/RTOs play an essential role in managing and enhancing all three of these flows.\n\n===Current RTOs===\nAs of 2012 there are ten ISO/RTOs operating in North America:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ferc.gov/industries/electric/indus-act/rto.asp|title=Regional Transmission Organizations (RTO)/Independent System Operators (ISO)|website=ferc.gov|accessdate=8 Apr 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isorto.org|title=isorto.org|website=isorto.org}}</ref>\n* [[Alberta Electric System Operator]] (AESO)\n* [[California independent system operator]] (CAISO)\n* [[Electric Reliability Council of Texas]] (ERCOT)\n* [[Midcontinent Independent System Operator]], Inc.

ColumbiaGrid was formed after some of its members chose not to continue in efforts to form Grid West, a Northwest evolutionary structure with the ability to add functions and to move toward independent grid management. The ColumbiaGrid members, including the [[Bonneville Power Administration]], several [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] State public utilities and two investor-owned utilities, wanted an organization with more limited functions and no independent ability to change.  ColumbiaGrid performs single-utility transmission planning and expansion via an open and transparent process and is also establishing a multi-system OASIS portal.\n\nThe former Grid West participants who had argued for an eventual RTO, mainly investor-owned utilities and state representatives from [[Oregon]], [[Idaho]], [[Montana]], [[Wyoming]] and [[Utah]], formed the Northern Tier Transmission Group (NTTG), a nascent effort open to evolution but initially focused on inexpensive and relatively easy improvements to grid management, including area control error (ACE) diversity interchange, currently underway; transparent methodologies for calculating available transmission capacity; and planning, as required by FERC Order 890.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Energy}}\n* [[United States energy]]\n* [[Transmission system operator]] (TSO)\n* [[European Transmission System Operators]]\n* [[Energy law]]\n* [[Electricity distribution]]\n\n{{Electricity generation}}\n\n==References==\n<!--- See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically -->\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.isorto.org/ ISO/RTO Council] Includes a map of ISO/RTO Regions\n* [http://www.ferc.gov/industries/electric/indus-act/rto.asp FERC RTO/ISO Regions]\n* [http://www.nerc.com/ North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC)]\n* [http://www.aeso.ca/ Alberta Electric System Operator (AESO)]\n* [http://www.caiso.com/ California ISO (CAISO)]\n* [http://www.ercot.com/ Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT)]\n* [http://www.ieso.ca/ Ontario Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO)]\n* [http://www.iso-ne.com/ ISO New England (ISONE)]\n* [http://www.nyiso.com/ New York Independent System Operator (NYISO)]\n* [http://www.pjm.com/ PJM Interconnection (PJM)]\n* [http://www.spp.org/ Southwest Power Pool (SPP)]\n* [http://www.iso-ne.com ISO New England (ISO-NE)]\n* [http://www.misoenergy.org Mid-Continent ISO]\n* [http://www.nyiso.com New York Independent System Operator (NYISO)]\n* [http://www.pjm.com PJM Interconnection (PJM)]\n* [http://www.columbiagrid.org ColumbiaGrid]\n* [http://www.ieso.ca Ontario's Independent Electricity System Operator]\n\n<!--- Links to the same article in other languages - if the articles exist already -->\n<!--- see [[Help:Interlanguage links]] -->\n\n[[Category:Electric power transmission system operators in North America]]"}]}}}}
