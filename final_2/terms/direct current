The horizontal axis measures time; the vertical, current or voltage.]]\n'''Direct current''' ('''DC''') is the unidirectional flow of [[electric charge]]. Direct current is produced by sources such as [[battery (electrical)|batteries]], [[power supply|power supplies]], [[thermocouple]]s, [[solar cell]]s, or [[dynamo]]s.  Direct current may flow in a [[conductor (material)|conductor]] such as a wire, but can also flow through [[semiconductor]]s, [[electrical insulation|insulator]]s, or even through a [[vacuum]] as in [[electron beam|electron or ion beams]]. The electric current flows in a constant direction, distinguishing it from [[alternating current]] (AC). A [[archaism|term formerly used]] for this type of current was '''galvanic current'''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Clinical Electrophysiology: Electrotherapy and Electrophysiologic Testing |author=Andrew J.

Direct current may be converted into alternating current with an [[inverter (electrical)|inverter]] or a motor-generator set.\n\nDirect current is used to charge batteries and as power supply for electronic systems. Very large quantities of direct-current power are used in production of [[aluminum]] and other [[electrochemistry|electrochemical]] processes. It is also used for some [[Railway_electrification_system#Direct_current|railways]], especially in urban areas. [[High-voltage direct current]] is used to transmit large amounts of power from remote generation sites or to interconnect alternating current power grids.\n\n{{Electromagnetism |Network}}\n\n==History==\nThe first commercial [[electric power transmission]] (developed by [[Thomas Edison]] in the late nineteenth century) used direct current. Because of the significant advantages of alternating current over direct current in transforming and transmission, electric power distribution is nearly all alternating current today. In the mid-1950s, [[high-voltage direct current]] transmission was developed, and is now an option instead of long-distance high voltage alternating current systems. For long distance underseas cables (e.g. between countries, such as [[NorNed]]), this DC option is the only technically feasible option. For applications requiring direct current, such as [[third rail]] power systems, alternating current is distributed to a substation, which utilizes a [[rectifier]] to convert the power to direct current. ''See [[War of Currents]]''.\n\n==Various definitions==\n[[File:Current rectification diagram.svg|right|250px|thumb|Types of direct current]] The term ''DC'' is used to refer to power systems that use only one polarity of voltage or current, and to refer to the constant, zero-frequency, or slowly varying local mean value of a voltage or current.<ref>{{cite book | title = Newnes Dictionary of Electronic | author = Roger S. Amos, Geoffrey William Arnold Dummer | publisher = Newnes |edition=4th| year = 1999 | isbn = 0-7506-4331-5 |page=83| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=c4qHqtC9JkgC&pg=PA83&dq=dc+zero-frequency#PPA83,M1 }}</ref>  For example, the voltage across a DC [[voltage source]] is constant as is the current through a DC [[current source]]. The DC solution of an [[electric circuit]] is the solution where all voltages and currents are constant. It can be shown that any [[stationary process|stationary]] voltage or current waveform can be decomposed into a sum of a DC component and a zero-mean time-varying component; the DC component is defined to be the expected value, or the average value of the voltage or current over all time.\n\nAlthough DC stands for \"direct current\", DC often refers to \"constant polarity\". Under this definition, DC voltages can vary in time, as seen in the raw output of a rectifier or the fluctuating voice signal on a telephone line.\n\nSome forms of DC (such as that produced by a [[voltage regulator]]) have almost no variations in [[voltage]], but may still have variations in output [[electric power|power]] and current.\n\n==Circuits==\nA direct current circuit is an [[electrical circuit]] that consists of any combination of constant [[voltage]] sources, constant [[current (electricity)|current]] sources, and [[resistor]]s.  In this case, the circuit voltages and currents are independent of time.  A particular circuit voltage or current does not depend on the past value of any circuit voltage or current.  This implies that the system of equations that represent a DC circuit do not involve integrals or derivatives with respect to time.\n\nIf a [[capacitor]] or [[inductor]] is added to a DC circuit, the resulting circuit is not, strictly speaking, a DC circuit.  However, most such circuits have a DC solution.  This solution gives the circuit voltages and currents when the circuit is in [[DC steady state]]. Such a circuit is represented by a system of [[differential equations]].  The solution to these equations usually contain a time varying or [[Transient state|transient]] part as well as constant or steady state part.  It is this steady state part that is the DC solution.  There are some circuits that do not have a DC solution.  Two simple examples are a constant current source connected to a capacitor and a constant voltage source connected to an inductor.\n\nIn electronics, it is common to refer to a circuit that is powered by a DC voltage source such as a battery or the output of a DC power supply as a DC circuit even though what is meant is that the circuit is DC powered.\n\n==Applications==\n{{Expand section|1=more examples and additional citations (see also introduction)|date=October 2015}}\n===Domestic===\n[[File:Direct current symbol.svg|right|200px|thumb|This symbol which can be represented with [[Unicode]] character {{U+|2393}} (&#8203;\u2393&#8203;) is found on many electronic devices that either require or produce direct current.]]\nDC is commonly found in many [[extra-low voltage]] applications and some [[low voltage|low-voltage]] applications, especially where these are powered by [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] or [[solar power]] systems (since both can produce only DC).\n\nMost [[electronics|electronic]] circuits require a DC [[power supply]].\n\nDomestic DC installations usually have different types of [[Jack (connector)|sockets]], [[DC connector|connectors]], [[switch]]es, and [[Light fixture|fixture]]s from those suitable for alternating current. This is mostly due to the lower voltages used, resulting in higher currents to produce the same amount of [[Watt|power]].\n\nIt is usually important with a DC appliance to observe polarity, unless the device has a [[diode bridge]] to correct for this.\n\n===Automotive===\nMost automotive applications use DC. The [[alternator]] is an AC device which uses a [[rectifier]] to produce DC. Usually 12&nbsp;[[volt|V]] DC are used, but a few have a 6&nbsp;V (e.g. [[Volkswagen_Beetle|classic VW Beetle]]) or a [[42&nbsp;V electrical system]].\n\n===Telecommunication===\nThrough the use of a [[DC-DC converter]], higher DC voltages such as 48&nbsp;V to 72&nbsp;V DC can be stepped down to 36&nbsp;V, 24&nbsp;V, 18&nbsp;V, 12&nbsp;V, or 5&nbsp;V to supply different loads.  In a telecommunications system operating at 48&nbsp;V DC, it is generally more efficient to step voltage down to 12&nbsp;V to 24&nbsp;V DC with a DC-DC converter and power equipment loads directly at their native DC input voltages, versus operating a 48&nbsp;V DC to 120&nbsp;V AC inverter to provide power to equipment.\n\nMany [[telephone]]s connect to a [[twisted pair]] of wires, and use a [[bias tee]] to internally separate the AC component of the voltage between the two wires (the audio signal) from the DC component of the voltage between the two wires (used to power the phone).\n\n[[Telephone exchange]] communication equipment, such as [[DSLAM]]s, uses standard \u221248&nbsp;V DC power supply. The negative polarity is achieved by [[ground (electricity)|grounding]] the positive terminal of power supply system and the [[battery (electricity)|battery]] bank. This is done to prevent [[electrolysis]] depositions.\n\n===High-voltage power transmission===\n{{main|High-voltage direct current}}\nHigh-voltage direct current (HVDC) electric power transmission systems use DC for the bulk transmission of electrical power, in contrast with the more common alternating current systems. For long-distance transmission, HVDC systems may be less expensive and suffer lower electrical losses.\n\n===Other===\nApplications using [[fuel cells]] (mixing hydrogen and oxygen together with a catalyst to produce electricity and water as byproducts) also produce only DC.\n\nLight aircraft electrical systems are typically 12&nbsp;V or 20&nbsp;V DC.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Electronics|Energy}}\n* [[Electric current]]\n* [[High-voltage direct current]] power transmission.\n* [[Alternating current]]\n* [[DC offset]]\n* [[Neutral direct-current telegraph system]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* \"''[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/edison/sfeature/acdc.html AC/DC: What's the Difference]?''\".\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.itacanet.org/eng/elec/edu/pt13.pdf |title=DC And AC Supplies |publisher=[http://www.itacanet.org/eng/elec/edu/contents.htm ITACA]}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Direct Current}}\n[[Category:Electrical engineering]]\n[[Category:Electric current]]\n[[Category:Electric power]]"}]}}}}
