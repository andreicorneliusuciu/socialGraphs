It produces high-quality text and graphics (and moderate-quality photographs) by repeatedly passing a [[laser beam]] back and forth over a negatively [[Electric charge|charged]] cylinder called a \"drum\" to define a differentially charged image.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/laser%20printer|title=Laser Printer - Definition of laser printer by Merriam-Webster|publisher=merriam-webster.com}}</ref> The drum then selectively collects electrically charged powdered ink ([[toner]]), and transfers the image to paper, which is then heated in order to permanently fuse the text and/or imagery. As with digital [[photocopier]]s, laser [[computer printer|printer]]s employ a [[Xerography|xerographic]] printing process. However, laser printing differs from analog photocopiers in that the image is produced by the direct scanning of the medium across the printer's photoreceptor. This enables laser printing to copy images more quickly than most photocopiers.\n\nInvented at [[Xerox]] PARC in the 1970s, laser printers were introduced for the office and then home markets in subsequent years by IBM, Canon, Xerox, Apple, Hewlett-Packard and many others. Over the decades, quality and speed have increased as price has fallen, and the once cutting-edge printing devices are now ubiquitous.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Gary Starkweather.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gary Starkweather]] invented the laser printer (2009 photo)]]\nIn the 1960s, the [[Xerox Corporation]] held a dominant position in the [[photocopier]] market. In 1969, [[Gary Starkweather]], who worked in Xerox's product development department, had the idea of using a laser beam to \"draw\" an image of what was to be copied directly onto the copier drum. After transferring to the recently formed [[Palo Alto Research Center]] (Xerox PARC) in 1971, Starkweather adapted a Xerox 7000 copier to create SLOT (Scanned Laser Output Terminal). In 1972, Starkweather worked with [[Butler Lampson]] and Ronald Rider to add a control system and character generator, resulting in a printer called EARS (Ethernet, Alto Research character generator, Scanned laser output terminal)\u2014which later became the [[Xerox 9700]] laser printer.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Gladwell| first=Malcolm| title=Creation Myth - Xerox PARC, Apple, and the truth about innovation|journal=The New Yorker| date=May 16, 2011| url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/05/16/110516fa_fact_gladwell?currentPage=all| accessdate=28 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{ cite book | title = Milestones in Computer Science and Information Technology | author = Edwin D.

It was designed for [[data center]]s, where it replaced [[line printer]]s attached to [[mainframe computers]]. The IBM 3800 was used for high-volume printing on [[continuous stationery]], and achieved speeds of 215 [[pages per minute]] (ppm), at a resolution of 240 [[dots per inch]] (dpi). Over 8,000 of these printers were sold.<ref name=\"Kasdorf2003\">{{cite book|author=William E.

Unlike the IBM 3800, the Xerox 9700 was not targeted to replace any particular existing printers; but, it did have limited support for the loading of [[Computer font|fonts]]. The Xerox 9700 excelled at printing high-value documents on cut-sheet paper with varying content (e.g. insurance policies).<ref name=\"Kasdorf2003\"/>\n\nIn 1979,<ref name=\"Ujiie2006\">{{cite book|author=H Ujiie|title=Digital Printing of Textiles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UOZRAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA5|date=28 April 2006|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=978-1-84569-158-5|pages=5\u2013}}</ref> inspired by the  Xerox 9700's commercial success, Japanese camera and optics company, [[Canon (company)|Canon]], developed a low-cost, ''desktop'' laser printer: the Canon LBP-10. Canon then began work on a much-improved print engine, the Canon CX, resulting in the LBP-CX printer. Lacking experience in selling to computer users, Canon sought partnerships with three [[Silicon Valley]] companies: [[Diablo Data Systems]] (who turned them down), [[Hewlett-Packard]] (HP), and [[Apple Computer]].<ref name=\"Malone2007\">{{cite book|author=Michael Shawn Malone|title=Bill & Dave: How Hewlett and Packard Built the World's Greatest Company|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KMSH_wzyDaEC&pg=PA327|year=2007|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-59184-152-4|pages=327\u2013}}</ref>\n\nThe first laser printer designed for office use reached market in 1981: the [[Xerox Star]] 8010. The system used a [[desktop metaphor]] that was unsurpassed in commercial sales, until the [[Apple Macintosh]]. Although it was innovative, the Star workstation was a prohibitively expensive ({{US$|17,000}}) system, affordable only to a fraction of the businesses and institutions at which it was targeted.<ref name=\"Strassmann2008\">{{cite book|author=Paul A.

The LaserJet was quickly followed by printers from [[Brother Industries]], [[IBM]], and others. First-generation machines had large photosensitive drums, of circumference greater than the loaded paper's length. Once faster-recovery coatings were developed, the drums could touch the paper multiple times in a pass, and therefore be smaller in diameter.\n\nIn 1985, Apple introduced the [[LaserWriter]] (also based on the Canon CX engine),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.printerworks.com/Catalogs/CX-Catalog/CX-AppLW-LWPlus.html|title=TPW - CX Printers- Apple|work=printerworks.com}}</ref> but used the newly released [[PostScript]] page-description language. Up until this point, each manufacturer used its own proprietary page-description language, making the supporting software complex and expensive. PostScript allowed the use of text, fonts, graphics, images, and color largely independent of the printer's brand or resolution. [[PageMaker]], written by [[Aldus]] for the Macintosh and LaserWriter, was also released in 1985 and the combination became very popular for [[desktop publishing]].<ref name=\"Allan2001\"/>{{rp|13/23}}<ref name=\"Kasdorf2003\"/> {{rp|364}} Laser printers brought exceptionally fast and high-quality text printing in multiple fonts on a page, to the business and consumer markets. No other commonly available printer during this era could also offer this combination of features.\n\n== Printing process ==\n{{Main|Xerography}}\n[[File:Laser toner cartridge.svg|500px|thumb|Diagram of a laser printer]]\n[[File:Laser printer, 2015-01-23.ogg|thumb|The sound of a laser printer]]\nA laser beam (typically, an [[aluminium gallium arsenide]] (AlGaAs) [[semiconductor laser]]) projects an image of the page to be printed onto an electrically charged, [[selenium]]-coated, rotating, cylindrical drum<ref name=\"Nagabhushana2010\">{{cite book|author=S. Nagabhushana|title=Lasers and Optical Instrumentation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FUzjTAr0U4MC&pg=PA269|year=2010|publisher=I. K. International Pvt Ltd|isbn=978-93-80578-23-1|pages=269\u2013}}</ref> (or, more commonly in subsequent versions, a drum called an [[organic compound|organic]] [[photoconductor]] made of [[N-vinylcarbazole]], an organic [[monomer]]). Photoconductivity allows the charged electrons to fall away from the areas exposed to light. Powdered ink ([[toner]]) particles are then electrostatically attracted to the charged areas of the drum that have not been laser-beamed. The drum then transfers the image onto paper (which is passed through the machine) by direct contact.  Finally the paper is passed onto a finisher, which uses intense heat to instantly fuse the toner/image onto the paper.\n\nThere are typically seven steps involved in the process:\n\n=== Raster image processing ===\nThe document to be printed is encoded in a page description language such as PostScript, [[Printer Command Language]] (PCL), or [[Open XML Paper Specification]] (OpenXPS). The [[raster image processor]] converts the page description into a [[bitmap]] which is stored in the printer's raster memory. Each horizontal strip of dots across the page is known as a [[raster scan|raster]] line or [[scan line]].\n\nLaser printing differs from other printing technologies in that each page is always rendered in a single continuous process without any pausing in the middle, while other technologies like [[inkjet printing|inkjet]] can pause every few lines. To avoid a [[buffer underrun]] (where the laser reaches a point on the page before it has the dots to draw there), a laser printer typically needs enough raster memory to hold the bitmap image of an entire page.\n\nMemory requirements increase with the square of the [[dots per inch]], so 600 dpi requires a minimum of 4 megabytes for monochrome, and 16 megabytes for color at 600 dpi. For fully graphical output using a page description language, a minimum of 1 megabyte of memory is needed to store an entire monochrome letter/A4 sized page of dots at 300 dpi. At 300 dpi, there are 90,000 dots per square inch (300 dots per linear inch). A typical 8.5 \u00d7 11 sheet of paper has {{convert|0.25|in|mm|adj=on}} margins, reducing the printable area to {{convert|8.0|x|10.5|in|mm}}, or 84 square inches. 84 sq/in \u00d7 90,000 dots per sq/in = 7,560,000 dots. 1 [[megabyte]] = 1,048,576 bytes, or 8,388,608 bits, which is just large enough to hold the entire page at 300 dpi, leaving about 100 kilobytes to spare for use by the raster image processor.\n\nIn a color printer, each of the four [[CMYK]] toner layers is stored as a separate bitmap, and all four layers are typically preprocessed before printing begins, so a minimum of 4 megabytes is needed for a full-color letter-size page at 300 dpi.\n\nDuring the 1980s, memory chips were still very expensive, which is why entry-level laser printers in that era always came with four-digit suggested retail prices in US dollars. Memory prices later plunged, and 1200 dpi printers have been widely available in the consumer market since 2008. 2400 dpi electrophotographic printing plate makers, essentially laser printers that print on plastic sheets, are also available.\n\n=== Charging ===\n[[File:Corona charging.svg|thumb|Applying a negative charge to the photosensitive drum]]\nIn older printers, a [[Corona discharge|corona wire]] positioned parallel to the drum or, in more recent printers, a primary charge roller, projects an [[electrostatic]] charge onto the photoreceptor (otherwise named the photo conductor unit), a revolving photosensitive drum or belt, which is capable of holding an electrostatic charge on its surface while it is in the dark.\n\nAn [[alternating current|AC]] bias voltage is applied to the primary charge roller to remove any residual charges left by previous images. The roller will also apply a [[direct current|DC]] bias on the drum surface to ensure a uniform negative potential.\n\nNumerous patents{{Specify|date=January 2010}} describe the photosensitive drum coating as a [[silicon]] [[sandwich]] with a photocharging layer, a charge leakage barrier layer, as well as a surface layer. One version{{Specify|date=January 2010}} uses [[amorphous silicon]] containing [[hydrogen]] as the light receiving layer, [[Boron nitride]] as a charge leakage barrier layer, as well as a surface layer of [[Doping (semiconductor)|doped silicon]], notably silicon with [[oxygen]] or [[nitrogen]] which at sufficient concentration resembles machining [[silicon nitride]].\n\n=== Exposing ===\n[[File:Laser printer-Writing.svg|thumb|Laser light selectively neutralizes the negative charge on the photoreceptive drum, to form an electrostatic image]]\n[[File:Laser unit dell p1500 print.jpg|thumb|Laser unit from a Dell P1500. The white hexagon is the rotating scanner mirror.]]\nA laser printer uses a laser because lasers are able to form highly focused, precise, and intense beams of light, especially over the short distances inside of a printer.  The laser is aimed at a rotating [[polygon]]al mirror which directs the light beam through a system of lenses and mirrors onto the photoreceptor drum, writing [[pixel]]s at rates up to sixty five million times per second.<ref>{{cite web|title=how Laser Process Technology animation (''sic'')|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDLM5fMFyA4|publisher=Lexmark|date=14 July 2012}}</ref> The drum continues to rotate during the sweep, and the angle of sweep is canted very slightly to compensate for this motion. The stream of rasterized data held in the printer's memory rapidly turns the laser on and off as it sweeps.\n\nThe laser beam neutralizes (or reverses) the charge on the surface of the drum, leaving a [[static electricity|static electric]] negative image on the drum's surface which will repel the negatively charged toner particles. The areas on the drum which were struck by the laser, however, momentarily have no charge, and the toner being pressed against the drum by the toner-coated developer roll in the next step moves from the roll's rubber surface to the uncharged portions of the surface of the drum.\n\nSome non-laser printers ([[LED printer]]s) use an array of [[light emitting diodes]] spanning the width of the page to generate an image, rather than using a laser. \"Exposing\" is also known as \"writing\" in some documentation.\n\n=== Developing ===\nThe surface with the latent image is exposed to [[toner]] which has been applied in a 15-micron-thick layer to the developer roll.  Toner consists of fine particles of dry plastic powder mixed with [[carbon black]] or coloring agents. The toner particles are given a negative charge inside the toner cartridge, and as they emerge onto the developer drum they are electrostatically attracted to the photoreceptor's latent image (the areas on the surface of the drum which had been struck by the laser). Because negative charges repel each other, the negatively charged toner particles will not adhere to the drum where the negative charge (imparted previously by the charge roller) remains.\n\n=== Transferring ===\nA sheet of paper is then rolled under the photoreceptor drum, which has been coated with a pattern of toner particles in the exact places where the laser struck it moments before.  The toner particles have a very weak attraction to both the drum and the paper, but the bond to the drum is weaker and the particles transfer once again, this time from the drum's surface to the paper's surface. Some machines also use a positively charged \"transfer roller\" on the back side of the paper to help pull the negatively charged toner from the photoreceptor drum to the paper.\n\n=== Fusing ===\n[[File:Laser printer fusing.svg|thumb|left|Toner is melted onto paper with heat and pressure]]\nThe paper passes through rollers in the fuser assembly, where temperatures up to {{convert|200|C}} and pressure are used to permanently bond the plastic powder to the paper. One roller is usually a hollow tube (heat roller) and the other is a rubber backed roller (pressure roller). A radiant heat lamp is suspended in the centre of the hollow tube, and its [[infrared]] energy uniformly heats the roller from the inside. For proper bonding of the toner, the fuser roller must be uniformly hot.\n\nSome printers use a very thin flexible metal foil roller, so there is less [[thermal mass]] to be heated and the fuser can more quickly reach [[operating temperature]]. If paper moves through the fuser more slowly, there is more roller contact time for the toner to melt, and the fuser can operate at a lower temperature. Smaller, inexpensive laser printers typically print slowly, due to this energy-saving design, compared to large high speed printers where paper moves more rapidly through a high-temperature fuser with a very short contact time.\n\n=== Cleaning and recharging===\n[[File:Color Laser Printer Magnified.jpg|thumb|Magnification of color laser printer output, showing individual toner particles comprising 4 dots of an image with a bluish background]]\nAs the drum completes a revolution, it is exposed to an electrically neutral soft plastic blade which cleans any remaining toner from the photoreceptor drum and deposits it into a waste reservoir.  A charge roller then re-establishes a uniform negative charge on the surface of the now clean drum, readying it to be struck again by the laser.\n\n=== Continuous printing ===\nOnce the raster image generation is complete, all steps of the printing process can occur one after the other in rapid succession. This permits the use of a very small and compact unit, where the photoreceptor is charged, rotates a few degrees and is scanned, rotates a few more degrees and is developed, and so forth. The entire process can be completed before the drum completes one revolution.\n\nDifferent printers implement these steps in distinct ways. [[LED printer]]s actually use a linear array of [[light-emitting diode]]s to \"write\" the light on the drum. The toner is based on either [[wax]] or [[plastic]], so that when the paper passes through the fuser assembly, the particles of toner melt. The paper may or may not be oppositely charged. The fuser can be an infrared oven, a heated pressure roller, or (on some very fast, expensive printers) a [[xenon flash lamp]]. The warmup process that a laser printer goes through when power is initially applied to the printer consists mainly of heating the fuser element.\n\n===Malfunctions===\nThe mechanism inside a laser printer is somewhat delicate and, once damaged, often impossible to repair.  The drum in particular is a critical component: it must not be left exposed to ambient light for more than a few hours, as light is what causes it to lose its charge and will eventually wear it out.  Anything that interferes with the operation of the laser such as a scrap of torn paper may prevent the laser from discharging some portion of the drum, causing those areas to appear as white vertical streaks.  If the neutral wiper blade fails to remove residual toner from the drum's surface, that toner may circulate on the drum a second time, causing smears on the printed page with each revolution.  If the charge roller becomes damaged or does not have enough power, it may fail to adequately negatively charge the surface of the drum, allowing the drum to pick up excessive toner on the next revolution from the developer roll and causing a repeated but fainter image from the previous revolution to appear down the page.\n\nIf the toner doctor blade does not ensure that a smooth, even layer of toner is applied to the developer roll, the resulting printout may have white streaks from this in places where the blade has scraped off too much toner. Alternatively if the blade allows too much toner to remain on the developer roll, the toner particles might come loose as the roll turns, precipitate onto the paper below, and become bonded to the paper during the fusing process. This will result in a general darkening of the printed page in broad vertical stripes with very soft edges.\n\nIf the fuser roller does not reach a high enough temperature or if the ambient humidity is too high, the toner will not fuse well to the paper and may flake off after printing.  If the fuser is too hot, the plastic component of the toner may smear, causing the printed text to look like it is wet or smudged, or may cause the melted toner to soak through the paper to the back side.\n\nDifferent manufacturers claim that their toners are specifically developed for their printers, and that other toner formulations may not match the original specifications in terms of either tendency to accept a negative charge, to move to the discharged areas of the photoreceptor drum from the developer roll, to fuse appropriately to the paper, or to come off the drum cleanly in each revolution.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n== Performance ==\nAs with most electronic devices, the cost of laser printers has fallen markedly over the years. In 1984, the HP LaserJet sold for $3500,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/abouthp/histnfacts/museum/imagingprinting/0018/index.html | title = HP Virtual Museum: Hewlett-Packard LaserJet printer, 1984 | publisher = Hp.com | date = | accessdate = 2010-11-17 }}</ref> had trouble with even small, low resolution graphics, and weighed {{convert|32|kg|abbr=on}}. {{As of|2016}}, low-end monochrome laser printers can sell for less than $75. These printers tend to lack onboard processing and rely on the host computer to generate a [[raster image]], but outperform the 1984 LaserJet in nearly all situations.\n\nLaser printer speed can vary widely, and depends on many factors, including the graphic intensity of the job being processed. The fastest models can print over 200 [[monochrome]] pages per minute (12,000 pages per hour). The fastest color laser printers can print over 100 pages per minute (6000 pages per hour). Very high-speed laser printers are used for mass mailings of personalized documents, such as credit card or utility bills, and are competing with [[lithography]] in some commercial applications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.papergear.com/xerox-news/facts-about-laser-printing.html |title=Facts about laser printing |publisher=Papergear.com |date=2010-09-01 |accessdate=2010-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124224933/http://www.papergear.com/xerox-news/facts-about-laser-printing.html |archivedate=November 24, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe cost of this technology depends on a combination of factors, including the cost of paper, toner, drum replacement, as well as the replacement of other items such as the fuser assembly and transfer assembly. Often printers with soft plastic drums can have a very high cost of ownership that does not become apparent until the drum requires replacement.\n\n[[Duplex printing]] (printing on both sides of the paper) can halve paper costs and reduce filing volumes. Formerly only available on high-end printers, duplexers are now common on mid-range office printers, though not all printers can accommodate a duplexing unit. Duplexing can also give a slower page-printing speed, because of the longer paper path.\n\n== Color laser printers ==\n[[File:FujiXeroxDocuColourLaserPrint C1110B.PNG|thumb|[[Fuji Xerox]] color laser printer C1110B]]\nColor laser printers use colored toner (dry ink), typically [[cyan]], [[magenta]], [[yellow]], and [[black]] ([[CMYK]]). While monochrome printers only use one laser scanner assembly, color printers often have two or more.\n\nColor printing adds complexity to the printing process because very slight misalignments known as registration errors can occur between printing each color, causing unintended color fringing, blurring, or light/dark streaking along the edges of colored regions. To permit a high registration accuracy, some color laser printers use a large rotating belt called a \"transfer belt\". The transfer belt passes in front of all the toner cartridges and each of the toner layers are precisely applied to the belt. The combined layers are then applied to the paper in a uniform single step.\n\nColor printers usually have a higher cost per page than monochrome printers (even if printing monochrome-only pages).\n\n=== Business model comparison with inkjet printers ===\nManufacturers use a similar [[business model]] for both low-cost color laser printers and [[inkjet printers]]: the printers are sold cheaply while replacement toners and inks are relatively expensive. Color laser printers are much faster than inkjet printers and their running cost per page is usually slightly less. The print quality of color lasers is limited by their resolution (typically 600\u20131200 dpi) and their use of just four color toners. They often have trouble printing large areas of the same or subtle  gradations of color. Inkjet printers designed for printing photos can produce much higher quality color images.<ref name=\"SteinmuellerGulbins2010\">{{cite book|author1=Uwe Steinmueller|author2=Juergen Gulbins|title=Fine Art Printing for Photographers: Exhibition Quality Prints with Inkjet Printers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xKj-3QdjCyMC&pg=PT37|date=21 December 2010|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4571-0071-0|pages=37\u2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Anti-counterfeiting marks ===\n[[File:Printer Steganography Illustration.png|thumb|upright|Small yellow dots on white paper, generated by a color laser printer, are nearly invisible.

For these toner cartridges (as with inkjet cartridges), reset devices can be used to override the limitation set by the smart chip. Also, for some printers, online walk-throughs have been posted to demonstrate how to use up all the ink in the cartridge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rumburg.org/printerhack/|title=Hacking the Samsung CLP-315 Laser Printer|work=Hello World!}}</ref>  These chips offer no benefit to the end consumer\u2014all laser printers originally used an optical mechanism to assess the amount of remaining toner in the cartridge rather than using a chip to electrically count the number of printed pages, and the chip's only function was as an alternate method to decrease the cartridge's usable life.\n\n== Safety hazards, health risks, and precautions ==\n\n=== Toner clean-up ===\n[[Toner]] particles are formulated to have electrostatic properties and can develop static electric charges when they rub against other particles, objects, or the interiors of transport systems and vacuum hoses. Static discharge from charged toner particles can ignite combustible particles in a vacuum cleaner bag or create a small [[dust explosion]] if sufficient toner is airborne. Toner particles are so fine that they are poorly filtered by conventional household vacuum cleaner filter bags and blow through the motor or back into the room.\n\nIf toner spills into the laser printer, a special type of vacuum cleaner with an electrically conductive hose and a high-efficiency ([[HEPA]]) filter may be needed for effective cleaning. These specialized tools are called \"ESD-safe\" (Electrostatic Discharge-safe) or \"toner vacuums\".\n\n=== Ozone hazards ===\nAs a normal part of the printing process, the high voltages inside the printer can produce a [[corona discharge]] that generates a small amount of ionized oxygen and nitrogen, which react to form [[ozone]] and [[nitrogen oxides]]. In larger commercial printers and copiers, an [[activated carbon]] filter in the air exhaust stream breaks down{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} these noxious gases to prevent pollution of the office environment.\n\nHowever, some ozone escapes the filtering process in commercial printers, and ozone filters are not used at all in most smaller consumer printers. When a laser printer or copier is operated for a long period of time in a small, poorly ventilated space, these gases can build up to levels at which the odor of ozone or irritation may be noticed. A potential for creating a health hazard is theoretically possible in extreme cases.<ref>{{cite web | title = Photocopiers and Laser Printers Health Hazards | url = http://www.docs.csg.ed.ac.uk/Safety/general/photocopiers.pdf}}</ref>\n\n=== Respiratory health risks ===\n[[File:NIOSH Scientists Investigating Pollution From Office Equipment.webm|thumb|A video on research done on printer emissions]]\nAccording to a 2012 study conducted in Queensland, Australia, some printers emit sub-[[micrometre]] particles which some suspect may be associated with respiratory diseases.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17937279 |title=Particle emission characteristics of office printers. ;Environ Sci Technol. 2007&#93; - PubMed - NCBI |vauthors=He C, Morawska L, Taplin L |work=ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |year=2012 |accessdate=15 August 2012}}</ref> Of 63 printers evaluated in the [[Queensland University of Technology]] study, 17 of the strongest emitters were made by HP and one by [[Toshiba]].

According to Professor Morawska of Queensland University, one printer emitted as many particles as a burning cigarette:<ref>{{ cite news | title = Particle Emission Characteristics of Office Printers | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/printer-particles-as-bad-as-cigarettes/2007/07/31/1185647903291.html | work = The Sydney Morning Herald | date = 2007-08-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Study reveals the dangers of printer pollution | url = http://www.news.qut.edu.au/cgi-bin/WebObjects/News.woa/wa/goNewsPage?newsEventID=13495 }}</ref>\n\n{{quote\n| The health effects from inhaling [[ultrafine particles]] depend on particle composition, but the results can range from respiratory irritation to more severe illness such as [[Circulatory system|cardiovascular]] problems or [[cancer]].\n| Queensland University of Technology\n}}\n\nMuhle et al.

The review also observes that, because the emissions have been shown to be volatile or semi-volatile organic compounds, \"it would be logical to expect possible health effects to be more related to the chemical nature of the aerosol rather than the physical character of the \u2018particulate\u2019 since such emissions are unlikely to be or remain as \u2018particulates\u2019 after they come into contact with respiratory tissue\".<ref name='SFA_2011-12'>{{citation | first = Robert | last = Drew | title = Brief Review on Health Effects of Laser Printer Emissions Measured as Particles | publisher = [[Safe Work Australia]] | date = December 2011| id = | url = https://r.duckduckgo.com/l/?kh=-1&uddg=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.safeworkaustralia.gov.au%2Fsites%2Fswa%2Fabout%2Fpublications%2FDocuments%2F636%2FBrief%2520Review%2520Laser%2520Printer%2520Emissions.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2013-10-23}}</ref>\n\n=== Air transport ban ===\nAfter the [[2010 cargo plane bomb plot]], in which shipments of laser printers with explosive-filled toner cartridges were discovered on separate cargo airplanes, the US [[Transportation Security Administration]] prohibited pass-through passengers from carrying toner or ink cartridges weighing over {{convert|1|lb}} on inbound flights, in both carry-on and checked luggage.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/international/uk-plane-bombs-explosions-were-possible-over-u-s-ncx-20101110 | title = UK: Plane Bombs Explosions Were Possible Over U.S | publisher = Fox News | date = | accessdate = 2010-11-17 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120329061859/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/international/uk-plane-bombs-explosions-were-possible-over-u-s-ncx-20101110 | archivedate = March 29, 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"pcmag1\">{{ cite news | last = Hoffman | first = Tony | url = http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2372313,00.asp | title = U.S. Bans Large Printer Ink, Toner Cartridges on Inbound Flights | publisher = PC Mag | date = 2010-11-08| accessdate = 2010-11-17 }}</ref> ''[[PC Magazine]]'' noted that the ban would not impact most  travelers, as the majority of cartridges do not exceed the proscribed weight.<ref name=\"pcmag1\" />\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Cardboard engineering]]\n* [[Daisy wheel printer]]\n* [[Document automation]]\n* [[Dot matrix printer]]\n* [[Dye-sublimation printer]]\n* [[LED printer]]\n* [[List of printer companies]]\n* [[Solid ink]]\n* [[Steganography]]\n* [[Thermal printer]]\n* [[Winprinter]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Laser printers}}\n* [http://computer.howstuffworks.com/laser-printer.htm Howstuffworks \"How Laser Printers Work\"]\n* [http://tumb1.biblio.tu-muenchen.de/publ/diss/ei/2004/hoffmann_r.pdf Detailed description, modelling and simulation of the electrophotographic print process (technical; 7.2 MB)]\n* [http://inks.net.au/how-a-laser-printer-works/ How a Laser Printer Works Video]\n* [http://www.laserprinterhelp.net/article/AA-01906/17/Knowledgebase/Articles/The-Evolution-of-Color-Laser-Printers.html The Evolution of Color Laser Printers]\n* [http://www.summationtechnology.com/laser_cd_dvd_printer_thermal.htm Q.
