Within these types, there are many sub-types of motorcycles for different purposes. There is often a [[Motorcycle racing|racing]] counterpart to each type, such as [[road racing]] and street bikes, or [[motocross]] and dirt bikes.\n\nStreet bikes include [[cruiser (motorcycle)|cruisers]], [[sportbike]]s, [[scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]] and [[moped]]s, and many other types. Off-road motorcycles include many types designed for dirt-oriented racing classes such as [[motocross]] and are not street legal in most areas. Dual purpose machines like the [[dual-sport]] style are made to go off-road but include features to make them legal and comfortable on the street as well.\n\nEach configuration offers either specialised advantage or broad capability, and each design creates a different riding posture.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the motorcycle}}\n\n===Experimentation and invention===\n[[File:Daimler-1-motorcycle-1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Replica of the Daimler-Maybach ''Reitwagen''.]]\nThe first [[internal combustion engine|internal combustion]], [[petroleum]] fueled motorcycle was the [[Daimler Reitwagen|Daimler ''Reitwagen'']].

Starting was by compressed air. The engine was liquid-cooled, with a [[radiator]] over the rear driving wheel. Speed was controlled by means of a [[throttle]] valve lever. No braking system was fitted; the vehicle was stopped by raising and lowering the rear driving wheel using a foot-operated lever; the weight of the machine was then borne by two small castor wheels.

The first production motorcycle in the US was the Orient-Aster, built by [[Metz Company|Charles Metz]] in 1898 at his factory in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]].\n\nIn the early period of motorcycle history, many producers of [[bicycle]]s adapted their designs to accommodate the new internal combustion engine. As the engines became more powerful and designs outgrew the bicycle origins, the number of motorcycle producers increased. Many of the nineteenth century inventors who worked on early motorcycles often moved on to other inventions. Daimler and Roper, for example, both went on to develop automobiles.\n\nAt the turn of the century the first major mass-production firms were set up. In 1898, [[Triumph Engineering|Triumph Motorcycles]] in England began producing motorbikes, and by 1903 it was producing over 500 bikes.
