It has the symbol '''G'''.\n\n''Giga'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|\u03b3\u03af\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2}}, meaning \"[[wiktionary:giant|giant]]\". The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] reports the earliest written use of ''giga'' in this sense to be in the Reports of the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] 14th Conference in 1947: \"The following prefixes to abbreviations for the names of units should be used: G giga 10<sup>9</sup>\u00d7\".\n\nWhen referring to information units in [[computing]], such as ''[[gigabyte]]'', ''giga'' may sometimes mean {{gaps|1|073|741|824}} (2<sup>30</sup>), although such use is inconsistent, contrary to standards and has been discouraged by the [[standards organization]]s.<ref name=\"BIPM\">{{cite book\n|title=The International System of Units (SI)\n|url=http://www1.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8.pdf\n|format=PDF\n|accessdate=2007-02-25\n|edition=8th\n|year=2006\n|publisher=STEDI Media\n|location=Paris\n|language=French, English\n|isbn=92-822-2213-6\n|pages=127\n|chapter=\u00a73.1 SI prefixes\n|quote=[Side note:] These SI prefixes refer strictly to powers of 10. They should not be used to indicate powers of 2 (for example, one kilobit represents 1000 bits and not 1024 bits). The IEC has adopted prefixes for binary powers in the international standard IEC 60027-2: 2005, third edition, ''Letter symbols to be used in electrical technology \u2014 Part 2: Telecommunications and electronics''. The names and symbols for the prefixes corresponding to 2<sup>10</sup>, 2<sup>20</sup>, 2<sup>30</sup>, 2<sup>40</sup>, 2<sup>50</sup>, and 2<sup>60</sup> are, respectively: kibi, Ki; mebi, Mi; gibi, Gi; tebi, Ti; pebi, Pi; and exbi, Ei. Thus, for example, one kibibyte would be written: 1 KiB = 2<sup>10</sup> B = 1024 B, where B denotes a byte. Although these prefixes are not part of the SI, they should be used in the field of information technology to avoid the incorrect usage of the SI prefixes.\n}}</ref><ref name=\"NIST\">[http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf NIST Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (Appendix D. ref 5)]</ref> The inconsistency is that ''gigabit'' is never (or very rarely) used with the binary interpretation of the prefix, while ''gigabyte'' is sometimes used this way. The [[binary prefix]] ''[[gibi]]'' has been adopted for 2<sup>30</sup>, while reserving ''giga'' exclusively for the metric definition.\n\n==Pronunciation==\nIn [[English language|English]], the initial ''g'' of ''giga'' can be pronounced {{IPAslink|\u0261}} (a hard ''g'' as in ''giggle''), or  {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|d\u0292|\u026a|g|\u0259}} (a soft ''g'' as in ''giant'', like a ''j'' sound, which shares its Greek root).<ref>[http://lamar.colostate.edu/~hillger/si-prefixes.html A Practical Guide to the International System of Units, U.S. Metric Association, Feb 2008]</ref>\n\nThis latter pronunciation was formalized within the United States in the 1960s and 1980s with the issue by the US [[National Bureau of Standards]] of pronunciation guides for the metric prefixes.<ref>NBS Special Publication 304 & 304A, revised August 1981, \"A Brief History of Measurement Systems\"</ref>  A prominent example is found in the pronunciation of ''gigawatts'' in the 1985 movie ''[[Back to the Future]]''.\n\nAccording to the American writer Kevin Self, a German committee member of the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] proposed ''giga'' as a prefix for 10<sup>9</sup> in the 1920s, drawing on a verse by the humorous poet [[Christian Morgenstern]] that appeared in the third (1908) edition of ''Galgenlieder'' (Gallows Songs). This suggests that a hard German {{IPA|[\u0261]}} was originally intended as the pronunciation. Self was unable to ascertain at what point the alternative pronunciation came into occasional use, but claimed that as of 1995 it had died out.<ref>Kevin Self, April 1995, \"Technically speaking\", ''Spectrum''</ref>\n\nIn 1998, a poll by the phonetician [[John C. Wells]] found that 84% of Britons preferred the pronunciation of ''gigabyte'' starting with {{IPA|/\u0261\u026a/}} (as in ''gig''), 9% with {{IPA|/d\u0292\u026a/}} (as in ''jig''), 6% with {{IPA|/\u0261a\u026a/}} (''guy''), and 1% with {{IPA|/d\u0292a\u026a/}} (as in ''giant'').<ref>Wells, J.C.

In IEC standard, the correct notation of 1,073,741,824 is ''[[gibi]]'' (abbreviated to Gi).  So, 1GiB is 1,073,741,824 bytes ( 1 billion and 73 million 741 thousand 824 bytes ) or 1.074GB (when rounded up).  A laptop wrongly advertised as having 8GB has indeed 8,589,934,592 bytes of memory or 8.59GB.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Binary prefix]]\n*[[Gibibyte]]\n*[[Gigabit Ethernet]]\n*[[SI prefix]]\n*[[List of commonly used taxonomic affixes]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wiktionary|giga-}}\n*[http://www.bipm.org BIPM website]\n\n[[Category:SI prefixes]]\n\n[[he:\u05ea\u05d7\u05d9\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \u05d1\u05de\u05e2\u05e8\u05db\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05d7\u05d9\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d1\u05d9\u05e0\u05dc\u05d0\u05d5\u05de\u05d9\u05ea#\u05d2\u05d9\u05d2\u05d4]]"}]}}}}
