It was first introduced in the late 1960s on the [[Mercedes-Benz C111]].<ref>Bastow, D. (1970) Suspension ad Steering, Automobile Engineer, 8 May 1970, 217\u2013231.</ref> and later on their [[Mercedes-Benz W201|W201]] and [[Mercedes-Benz W124|W124]] series,.<ref>von der Ohe, M.

Consequently, they react to loads along their own length, in tension and compression, but not in bending. Some multi-links do use a [[trailing arm]] or [[A-arm|wishbone]], which has two bushings at one end.\n\nOn a front suspension one of the lateral arms is replaced by the tie-rod, which connects the rack or steering box to the wheel hub.\n\nIn order to simplify understanding, it is usual to consider the function of the arms in each of three orthogonal planes.\n\n==Solid axle configuration==\nFor a solid axle vehicle the multi link suspension provides control of the axle during suspension cycling and to locate the axle under the vehicle. The most common{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} is the four link with panhard bar. This is found in many cars and pickup trucks.  The four link is also used heavily in off-road racing and drag racing. The four link for a solid axle has a few variations such as the triangulated four link and double triangulated four link. Although common in off-road vehicles these are not commonly found on the street.\n\n==Plan view==\nThe arms have to control [[Toe (automotive)|toe]]/steer and lateral compliance. This needs a pair of arms longitudinally separated.\n\n==Front view==\n;Independent suspension: The arms have to control [[Camber angle|camber]], particularly the way that the camber changes as the wheel moves up (into jounce, or bump) and down into rebound or droop.\n;Solid axle suspension: In a solid axle suspension the upper arms may have an angle of at least 45 degrees between them, to prevent the axle from moving from side to side while allowing the axle to articulate and move freely up and down.\n\n==Side view==\n;Independent suspension: The arms have to react traction and braking loads, usually accomplished via a longitudinal link. They also have to control [[caster angle|caster]]. Note that brake torques also have to be reacted - either by a second longitudinal link, or by rotating the hub, which forces the lateral arms out of plane, so allowing them to react 'spin' forces, or by rigidly fixing the longitudinal link to the hub.\n;Solid axle suspension: For a solid axle the lower arms control forward and backward motion, the upper arms control forward and backward rotation. This rotation is present under acceleration and braking.\n\n==Advantages of multi-link suspension==\n;Benefit of independent suspension:Multi-link suspension allows the auto designer the ability to incorporate both good [[ride quality|ride]] and good [[car handling|handling]] in the same vehicle.{{paragraph break}}In its simplest form, multi-link suspension is orthogonal\u2014i.e., it is possible to alter one parameter in the suspension at a time, without affecting anything else.  This is in direct contrast to a [[double wishbone]] suspension, where moving a hardpoint or changing a bushing compliance will affect two or more parameters.{{paragraph break}}Advantages also extend to off-road driving.  A multi-link suspension allows the vehicle to flex more; this means simply that the suspension is able to move more easily to conform to the varying angles of off-road driving. Multi-link-equipped vehicles are ideally suited for sports such as desert racing.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}  In desert racing, the use of a good [[sway bar]] is needed to counter body roll.\n;Benefits of solid-axle multi-link suspension:The benefit of the triangulated and double-triangulated arrangement is that they do not need a panhard bar. The benefits of this are increased articulation and potential ease of installation.  The multi-link for solid axle offers a benefit over the independent multi-link in that it is significantly cheaper and much less complex to build.\n\n==Disadvantages of multi-link suspension==\nMultilink suspension is costly and complex. It is also difficult to tune the geometry without a full 3D [[computer aided design]] analysis.  Compliance under load can have an important effect and must be checked using a [[multibody]] simulation software.\n\n==Gallery<ref>{{cite book|last=Simionescu|first=P.A.|title=Computer Aided Graphing and Simulation Tools for AutoCAD Users|year=2014|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, FL|isbn=978-1-4822-5290-3|edition=1st}}</ref> ==\n\n<gallery> \nFile:5link-rear1-small.gif| 5-link rear wheel suspension mechanism (front view)\nFile:5link-rear2-small.gif| 5-link rear wheel suspension mechanism (top view)\nFile:5link-steer front view.gif| 5-link suspension mechanism with rack-and-pinion steering input (front view)\nFile:5link-steer top view.gif| 5-link suspension mechanism with rack-and-pinion steering input (top view)\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Suspension (vehicle)]]\n* [[Automotive suspension design]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\nAdams, H.
