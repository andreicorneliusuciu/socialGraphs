Volt-amperes are useful only in the context of [[alternating current]] (AC) circuits ([[Sine wave|sinusoidal]] voltages and currents of the same frequency).\n\nSome devices, including [[uninterruptible power supply|uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs)]], have ratings both for maximum volt-amperes and maximum watts. The VA rating is limited by the maximum permissible current, and the watt rating by the power-handling capacity of the device. When a UPS powers equipment which presents a [[electrical reactance|reactive]] load with a low [[power factor]], neither limit may safely be exceeded.<ref>[http://www.apc.com/site/support/us/en/faq/?page=content&id=FA157485 ''Watt Ratings Differs From Volt Amp Ratings''] APC</ref> For example, a (large) UPS system rated to deliver 400,000 volt-amperes at 220 volts can deliver a current of 1818 amperes.\n\nThe convention of using the volt-ampere to distinguish apparent power from real power is not supported by the SI standard, which prohibits using unit symbols to \"provide specific information\" about a quantity.<ref>[http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/section5-3-2.html SI Brochure, 8th ed.]: \"Just as the quantity symbol should not imply any particular choice of unit, the unit symbol should not be used to provide specific information about the quantity [\u2026]\" Section 5.3.2.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[AC power]]\n* [[Power factor]]\n* [[Volt-ampere reactive]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Units of power]]"}]}}}}
