In the system of Greek numerals it has a value of 2. In [[Ancient Greek]], beta represented the [[voiced bilabial plosive]] {{IPA|/b/}}. In [[Modern Greek]], it represents the [[voiced labiodental fricative]] {{IPA|/v/}}. Letters that arose from beta include the Roman letter {{angle bracket|[[B]]}} and the Cyrillic letters {{angle bracket|[[Be (Cyrillic)|\u0411]]}} and {{angle bracket|[[Ve (Cyrillic)|\u0412]]}}.\n\n==Name==\nLike the names of most other Greek letters, the name of beta was adopted from the [[acrophony|acrophonic]] name of the corresponding letter in Phoenician, which was the common [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] word ''*bayt'' ('house'). In Greek, the name was {{lang|grc|\u03b2\u1fc6\u03c4\u03b1}} ''b\u00eata'', pronounced {{IPA-el|b\u025b\u0302\u02d0ta|}} in Ancient Greek. It is spelled \u03b2\u03ae\u03c4\u03b1 in modern monotonic orthography, and pronounced {{IPA-el|\u02c8vita|}}. In US English, the name is pronounced {{IPA|/\u02c8be\u026at\u0259/}}, while in British English it is pronounced {{IPA|/\u02c8bi\u02d0t\u0259/}}. Beta in Hindi and Urdu means elder royal son (sometimes also called Beta Ji).\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Archaic Greek alphabets}}\nThe letter beta was derived from the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician letter]] [[Bet (letter)|beth]] [[Image:Phoenician beth.svg|20px|Beth]].\n\nThe letter \u0392 had the largest number of highly divergent local forms. Besides the standard form (either rounded or pointed, {{GrGl|Beta 16}}), there were forms as varied as {{GrGl|Beta 12}} ([[Gortyn]]), {{GrGl|Beta 01}} and {{GrGl|Beta 10}} ([[Thera]]), {{GrGl|Beta 03}} ([[Argos]]), {{GrGl|Beta 05}} ([[Melos]]), {{GrGl|Beta Corinth 1}} ([[Corinth]]), {{GrGl|Beta Byzantium 1}} ([[Megara]], [[Byzantium]]), {{GrGl|Gamma C-shaped}} ([[Cyclades]]).{{sfn|Jeffery|1961|p=23}}\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:NAMA Alphabet grec.jpg|thumb|The Greek alphabet on an ancient [[black figure]] vessel, with the characteristically angular beta of the time]]\n\n===Algebraic numerals===\nIn the system of [[Greek numerals]], beta has a value of 2. Such use is denoted by a number mark: \u0392\u2032. In Scientific unit notation it is used as a particle and pronounced as a /bIta/\n\n===Computing===\nIn computing, the term \"[[beta release|beta]]\" is used as (usually) the last testing release (or the preview release) in the [[software release life cycle]] before the \"release\" version. Beta versions often have a version number of the form \"0.''n''\", (or \"build ''number''\"). Typically it is the last version before a version of a software is fully released to all its actual customers.\n\n===Finance===\n[[Beta (finance)|Beta is used in finance]] as a measure of investment portfolio risk. Beta in this context is calculated as the covariance of the portfolio's returns with its benchmark's returns, divided by the variance of the benchmark's returns. A beta of 1.5 means that for every 1% change in the value of the benchmark, the portfolio's value changes by 1.5%.\n\n===International Phonetic Alphabet===\nIn the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], Greek minuscule beta denotes a [[voiced bilabial fricative]] {{ipa|[\u03b2]}}.\n\n===Meteorology===\nThe name Beta was used as a name during the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]] as [[Hurricane Beta]].\n\n===Mathematics and science===\nBeta is often used to denote a variable in mathematics and physics, where it often has specific meanings for certain applications, such as representing [[beta radiation]]. In [[regression analysis]], {{angle bracket|B}} symbolizes nonstandardized partial slope coefficients, whereas {{angle bracket|\u03b2}} represents [[Standardized coefficient|standardized (standard deviation-score form) coefficients]]; in both cases, the coefficients reflect the change in the criterion Y per one-unit change in the value of the associated predictor X.\n\n\u03b2 is sometimes used as a placeholder for an [[ordinal number]] if \u03b1 is already used.\n\nIn spaceflight, [[beta angle]] describes the angle between the orbit plane of a spacecraft or other body and the vector from the sun.\n\n===Rock climbing terminology===\nThe term \"[[Beta (climbing)|beta]]\" refers to advice on how to successfully complete a particular climbing route, boulder problem, or crux sequence.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n=== Statistics ===\nIn statistics, beta may represent [[type II error]], or [[regression analysis|regression]] slope.\n\n{{anchor|curled beta|Curled beta}}<!--linked from [[Romanization of Greek]], [[\u03d0]], [[Curled beta]], &c.-->\n\n===Typography===\nIn some high-quality typesetting, especially in the French tradition, a typographic variant of the lowercase letter without a [[descender]] is used within a word for [[ancient Greek]]: {{lang|el|\u03b2\u03af\u03b2\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2}} is printed {{lang|el|\u03b2\u03af\u03d0\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2}}.<ref name=\"haralambous\">{{cite web|last=Haralambous|first=Yannis|title=From Unicode to typography, a case study: the Greek script|url=http://omega.enstb.org/yannis/pdf/boston99.pdf|format=PDF|year=1999|page=7}}</ref>\n\nIn typesetting technical literature, it is a commonly made mistake to use the [[\u00df|German letter \u00df]] (a s\u2013z or s\u2013s ligature) as a replacement for \u03b2. The two letters resemble each other in some fonts, but they are unrelated.\n\n===Videotape format===\nBeta was the name of a domestic videotape format developed by Japan's Sony Corporation in the 1970s and 1980s. It competed with the Video Home System ([[VHS]]) format developed by the Japanese Victor Company, to which it eventually succumbed. The Beta format was also marketed as [[Betamax]] (Sony) and [[Betacord]] (Sanyo).\n\n== Character encodings ==\n\n* Greek Beta\n\n{{charmap\n|0392|name1=Greek Capital Letter Beta\n|03B2|name2=Greek Small Letter Beta\n|03D0|name3=Greek Beta Symbol\n|1D5D|name4=Modifier Letter Small Beta\n|1D66|name5=Greek Subscript Small Letter Beta\n|map2=DOS Greek|map2char1=81|map2char2=99\n|map3=DOS Greek-2|map3char1=A5|map3char2=D7\n|map4=Windows 1253|map4char1=C2|map4char2=E2\n|namedref1=TeX|ref1char2=\\beta\n}}\n\n* Latin Beta\n\n{{charmap\n|A7B4|name1=Latin Capital Letter Beta\n|A7B5|name2=Latin Small Letter Beta\n}}\n\n* CJK Square Beta\n\n{{charmap\n|333C|name1=Square Beeta\n}}\n\n* Mathematical Beta\n\n{{charmap\n|1D6A9|name1=Mathematical Bold<br />Capital Beta\n|1D6C3|name2=Mathematical Bold<br />Small Beta\n|1D6E3|name3=Mathematical Italic<br />Capital Beta\n|1D6FD|name4=Mathematical Italic<br />Small Beta\n|1D71D|name5=Mathematical Bold Italic<br />Capital Beta\n|1D737|name6=Mathematical Bold Italic<br />Small Beta\n}}\n\n{{charmap\n|1D757|name1=Mathematical Sans-Serif<br />Bold Capital Beta\n|1D771|name2=Mathematical Sans-Serif<br />Bold Small Beta\n|1D791|name3=Mathematical Sans-Serif<br />Bold Italic Capital Beta\n|1D7AB|name4=Mathematical Sans-Serif<br />Bold Italic Small Beta\n}}\n\nThese characters are used only as mathematical symbols.
