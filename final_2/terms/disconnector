Such switches are often found in [[electrical distribution]] and [[industry|industrial]] applications, where machinery must have its source of driving power removed for adjustment or repair.  High-voltage isolation switches are used in electrical substations to allow isolation of apparatus such as [[circuit breaker]]s, [[transformer]]s, and transmission lines, for maintenance. The disconnector is usually not intended for normal control of the circuit, but only for safety isolation. Disconnector can be operated either manually or automatically (motorized disconnector).\n\n[[File:Masttrenner_Koessnach_Detail.JPG|thumb|164px|Disconnectors for medium voltage]]\nUnlike [[load switch]]es and [[circuit breaker]]s, disconnectors lack a mechanism for suppression of [[electric arc]], which occurs when conductors carrying high currents are electrically interrupted. Thus, they are off-load devices, intended to be opened only after current has been interrupted by some other control device. Safety regulations of the utility must prevent any attempt to open the disconnector while it supplies a circuit. Standards in some countries for safety may require either local motor isolators or lockable overloads (which can be padlocked).\n\nDisconnectors have provisions for a [[padlock]] so that inadvertent operation is not possible ([[lockout-tagout]]). In high-voltage or complex systems, these padlocks may be part of a [[Trapped_key_interlocking|trapped-key interlock system]] to ensure proper sequence of operation.  In some designs, the isolator switch has the additional ability to [[ground (electricity)|earth]] the isolated circuit thereby providing additional safety. Such an arrangement would apply to circuits which inter-connect power distribution systems where both ends of the circuit need to be isolated.\n\nA '''switch disconnector''' combines the properties of the disconnector and the load switch,{{refn|{{cite web | url = http://electrical-engineering-portal.com/disconnectors-load-switches-switch-disconnectors-cbs#3 | title = \nDifferences between disconnectors, load switches, switch disconnectors and circuit breakers\n | author = Edvard Csanyi | website = Electrical Engineering Portal | date = 2014-06-20 | accessdate = 21 January 2016 }}}} so it provides the safety isolation function while being able to make and break nominal currents.\n\n==Integrated disconnecting switch==\nIn a [[circuit breaker#Disconnecting circuit breaker (DCB)|disconnecting circuit breaker]] the disconnectors are integrated in the breaking chamber, which eliminates the need for separate disconnectors. The intention of this combined device is to decrease maintenance and increase [[availability]] and [[reliability engineering|reliability]]. The usage of this device instead of a disconnector is limited due to the fact that the open gap is not clearly visible and many doubts in term of safety arise during maintenance activities. Where it is adopted the earthing switch must be used and the performance must be increased by the typical value.\n\nThe open-air disconnecting switches typically need maintenance every five years (every two years under very polluted conditions), while circuit breakers have maintenance intervals of 15 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Applications of Disconnecting Circuit Breakers, Michael Fax\u00e5, p. 1-2 |url=http://www.labplan.ufsc.br/congressos/td2006/Papers/TD06_525.pdf|accessdate=11 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t82wjbIP4fkC&pg=359#v=onepage&q=&f=false|title=Handbook of Electrical Installation Practice |last=Stokes |first=Geoffrey |isbn=978-0-632-06002-3|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2003}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Disconnecting switch}}\n* [http://teslamania.delete.org/frames/longarc.htm#Disconnect 115 kV disconnector opened \"hot\" (video)]\n\n[[Category:Electric power systems components]]\n\n\n{{Electric-power-stub}}"}]}}}}
