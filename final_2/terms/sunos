The ''SunOS'' name is usually only used to refer to versions 1.0 to 4.1.4, which were based on [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]], while versions 5.0 and later are based on UNIX [[System V Release 4]], and are marketed under the [[brand name]] ''[[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]]''.\n\n==History==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

SunOS&nbsp;2 supported Sun-2 and Sun-3 ([[Motorola 68020|68020]]) series systems. SunOS&nbsp;4 supported Sun-2 (until release 4.0.3), Sun-3 (until 4.1.1), [[Sun386i]] (4.0, 4.0.1 and 4.0.2 only) and Sun-4 ([[SPARC]]) architectures.  Although SunOS&nbsp;4 was intended to be the first release to fully support Sun's new SPARC processor, there was also a SunOS&nbsp;3.2 release with preliminary support for Sun-4 systems.\n\nSunOS 4.1.2 introduced support for Sun's first [[sun4m]]-architecture [[multiprocessor]] machines (the [[SPARCstation|SPARCserver]] 600MP series); since it had only a single [[lock (computer science)|lock]] for the kernel, only one [[CPU]] at a time could execute in the kernel.\n\nThe last release of SunOS&nbsp;4 was 4.1.4 (Solaris 1.1.2) in 1994. The [[SPARCstation|sun4]], [[SPARCstation|sun4c]] and [[SPARCstation|sun4m]] architectures were supported in 4.1.4; [[SPARCcenter|sun4d]] was not supported.\n\nSun continued to ship SunOS 4.1.3 and 4.1.4 until December 27, 1998; they were supported until September 30, 2003.\n\n==\"SunOS\" and \"Solaris\"==\n[[Image:SunOS 4.1.1 P1270750.jpg|thumb|SunOS 4.1.1 tape]]\nIn 1987, [[AT&T Corporation]] and Sun announced that they were collaborating on a project to merge the most popular Unix flavors on the market at that time: BSD (including many of the features then unique to SunOS), [[System V]], and [[Xenix]]. This would become [[System V Release 4]] (SVR4).<ref name=\"Salus\"/> \n\nOn September 4, 1991, Sun announced that its next major OS release would switch from its BSD-derived source base to one based on SVR4.  Although the internal designation of this release would be ''SunOS&nbsp;5'', from this point Sun began using the marketing name ''[[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]]''. The justification for this new \"overbrand\" was that it encompassed not only SunOS, but also the [[OpenWindows]] desktop environment and [[Open Network Computing]] (ONC) functionality.\n\nEven though the new SVR4-based OS was not expected to ship in volume until the following year, Sun immediately began using the new ''Solaris'' name to refer to the currently shipping SunOS 4 release (also including OpenWindows).  Thus SunOS 4.1.1 was rebranded ''Solaris&nbsp;1.0''; SunOS 5.0 would be considered a part of Solaris&nbsp;2.0.  SunOS&nbsp;4.1.''x'' micro versions continued to be released through 1994, and each of these was also given a ''Solaris 1.''x equivalent name.  In practice, these were often still referred to by customers and even Sun personnel by their SunOS release names. Matching the version numbers was not straightforward:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''SunOS 4.1.''x'' / Solaris 1.''x'' / OpenWindows releases'''\n|-\n! SunOS Version !! Solaris version !! OpenWindows version\n|-\n| 4.1.1<br>4.1.1B<br>4.1.1.1  || 1.0 || 2.0\n|-\n| 4.1.2  || 1.0.1 || 2.0\n|-\n| 4.1.3  || 1.1 SMCC Version A || 3.0\n|-\n| 4.1.3C || 1.1C || 3.0\n|-\n| 4.1.3_U1 || 1.1.1  || 3.0_U1\n|-\n| 4.1.3_U1B || 1.1.1B || 3.0_U1B\n|-\n| 4.1.4 || 1.1.2 || 3.0_414\n|}\n\nToday, SunOS&nbsp;5 is universally known as ''Solaris'', although the ''SunOS'' name is still visible within the OS itself{{snd}} in the startup banner, the output of the [[uname]] command, and [[man page]] footers, among other places.\n\nMatching a SunOS&nbsp;5.x release to its corresponding Solaris marketing name is simple: each Solaris release name includes its corresponding SunOS&nbsp;5 minor version number. For example, Solaris&nbsp;2.4 incorporated SunOS&nbsp;5.4.  There is one small twist: after Solaris&nbsp;2.6, the \"2.\" was dropped from the Solaris name and the SunOS minor number appears by itself. The latest Solaris release is named ''Solaris 11'' and incorporates SunOS&nbsp;5.11.\n\n==User interface==\n{{unreferencedsection|date=February 2010}}\n[[Graphical user interface|GUI]] environments bundled with earlier versions of SunOS included SunTools (later [[SunView]]) and [[NeWS]]. In 1989, Sun released [[OpenWindows]], an [[OPEN LOOK]]-compliant [[X11]]-based environment which also supported SunView and NeWS applications. This became the default SunOS GUI in SunOS&nbsp;4.1.1.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Comparison of BSD operating systems]]\n* [[Comparison of operating systems]]\n* [[Unix wars]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.sunhelp.org/faq/sunref1.html The Sun Hardware Reference (Overview)]\n* {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602025546/http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/solaris/versions |date=June 2, 2008 |title=SunOS & Solaris Version History }}\n* [http://www.informit.com/content/images/0130224960/samplechapter/0130224960.pdf ''An Introduction to Solaris'' &ndash; a sample chapter from ''Solaris Internals: Core Kernel Architecture'' by Jim Mauro & Richard McDougall, Prentice-Hall, 2000.
