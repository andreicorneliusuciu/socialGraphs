Many mechanical properties of polymers have an [[Arrhenius equation|Arrhenius]] type relationship with respect to time and temperature (for example, creep, stress relaxation, and tensile properties).  If one conducts short tests at elevated temperatures, that data can be used to extrapolate the behavior of the polymer at room temperature, avoiding the need to do lengthy, and hence expensive tests.\n\n== Purpose ==\nALT is primarily used to speed up tests. This is particularly useful in several cases:  \n* Low failure - Testing even a very large sample at normal conditions would yield few or no failures in a reasonable time.  \n* High longevity - The product must be reliable for a much longer time than can be reasonably tested at normal conditions. \n* High wear-out - The primary cause of failure occurs over an extended amount of time.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title = HALT vs. ALT: when to use which technique?|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1677392&tag=1|journal = Reliability and Maintainability Symposium, 2006.

If the test wanted to estimate how frequently the circuits needed to be replaced, then the category of low failure would also be applicable. Furthermore, if the circuits wore out from gradual use rather than extreme use (such as a large sudden shock), the wear out category would be involved. If a sudden shock was the primary cause of failure, a [[Highly accelerated life test|Highly Accelerated Life Test]] may be more appropriate.\n\n== Setting up a test ==\nDesigning a test involves considering what factors effect the test object, what you already know about the test object's behavior, and what you want to learn from the test.\n\n=== Test Conditions ===\n\nAll factors thought to influence the test object should be involved and tests should be conducted at various levels of each factor. Higher stress levels will speed up the test more however the cause of failure or other response measured must not be changed. For instance, melting components in a circuit would alter why the circuit failed. Increasing the number of tests or the number of test objects in each test generally increases how precisely one can infer the test objects behavior at operating conditions.\n\n=== Picking a Model ===\n\nA model is an equation that accurately relates a test object's performance to the levels of stress on it. This can be referred to as an acceleration model, with any constants called acceleration factors.<ref name=\":0\" /> The acceleration model is usually related to the types of materials or components tested. A few equations used for acceleration models are the [[Arrhenius equation|Arrhenius]] and [[Eyring equation|Eyring]] equations and the Coffin-Manson model.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Accelerated temperature cycle test and Coffin-Manson model for electronic packaging|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1408421|journal = Reliability and Maintainability Symposium, 2005.

Established models must show agreement between extrapolations from accelerated data and observed data across a range of stress factors.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Outdoor weathering of PV modules #x2014; Effects of various climates and comparison with accelerated laboratory testing|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6186415|journal = 2011 37th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference (PVSC)|date = 2011-06-01|pages = 002305\u2013002311|doi = 10.1109/PVSC.2011.6186415|first = W.|last = Herrmann|first2 = N.|last2 = Bogdanski}}{{dead link|date=November 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhen the appropriate model is not known in advance, or there exist multiple accepted models, the test must estimate what model fits best based on the context of the test and results from testing. Even if two models fit data at high stresses equally well, they may differ by orders of magnitude at lower stresses.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://energy.sandia.gov/wp-content/gallery/uploads/Sorensen-Sandia_AccAging.pdf|title = Accelerated Life Testing|date = May 28, 2010|accessdate = October 20, 2015|website = Sandia National Laboratories|publisher = |last = Sorensen|first = Rob}}</ref> This issue can be approached by more tests at a greater range of stresses however the cause of failure must remain unchanged. A possible pre-experiment approach to minimize this is to estimate what data you expect from testing, fit a model to the data, and determine if one would be able to make reliable conclusions if everything went as expected.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|title = 8.3.1.4.

For instance, a test that is measuring lifespan may look only at the mean time to failure of the test objects, or it may try to [[Distribution fitting|fit]] a [[Probability distribution|statistical distribution]] to the data. This is usually referred to as a life distribution, the [[Probability density function|particle density function]] of which represents the proportion of products failing at a given time.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = A Log-Logistic Step-Stress Model|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4585404|journal = IEEE Transactions on Reliability|date = 2008-09-01|issn = 0018-9529|pages = 431\u2013434|volume = 57|issue = 3|doi = 10.1109/TR.2008.928182|first = P.W.|last = Srivastava|first2 = R.|last2 = Shukla}}{{dead link|date=November 2015}}</ref> Several distributions for this purpose are the [[Exponential distribution|exponential]], [[Weibull distribution|Weibull]][[Log-normal distribution|, log-normal]], and [[Gamma distribution|gamma]] distributions.<ref>{{cite web|title = 8.1.6.

Tests at various stress levels would yield different values for the mean and standard deviation of the distribution. (its parameters) One would then use a known model or attempt to fit a model to relate how each stress factor influenced the distributions parameters. This relation would then be used to estimate the life distribution at operating conditions.\n\n== Step-Stress Accelerated Life Test ==\nA step stress ALT is a variant of ALT that tests a component at multiple stress levels, one after the other. Components that survive one test are immediately subjected to the next. These are widely modeled under the assumption that survival life of a product depends only on the current level of stress and how many test subjects have failed so far.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Comparison Analysis of Efficiency for Step-Down and Step-Up Stress Accelerated Life Testing|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6151208&tag=1|journal = IEEE Transactions on Reliability|date = 2012-06-01|issn = 0018-9529|pages = 590\u2013603|volume = 61|issue = 2|doi = 10.1109/TR.2012.2182816|first = Ronghua|last = Wang|first2 = Naijun|last2 = Sha|first3 = Beiqing|last3 = Gu|first4 = Xiaoling|last4 = Xu}}</ref> Step stress ALT can increment low to high, high to low, or through a mix of levels.
