The protocol stores and delivers database content in a human-readable format.<ref name=rfc3912>RFC 3912, ''WHOIS Protocol Specification'', L. Daigle (September 2004)</ref> The WHOIS protocol is documented in RFC 3912.\n\n==History==\nWhen the Internet was emerging out of the [[Advanced Research Project Agency Network|ARPANET]], there was only one organization that handled all domain registrations, which was [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|DARPA]] itself. The process of registration was established in <nowiki>RFC 920</nowiki>. WHOIS was standardized in the early 1980s to look up domains, people and other resources related to domain and number registrations. As all registration was done by one organization at that time, one centralized server was used for WHOIS queries. This made looking up such information very easy.\n\nResponsibility of domain registration remained with DARPA as the ARPANET became the Internet during the 1980s. [[UUNET]] began offering domain registration service; however they simply handled the paperwork which they forwarded to the DARPA Network Information Center (NIC). Then the [[National Science Foundation]] directed that management of Internet domain registration would be handled by commercial, third-party entities. [[InterNIC]] was formed in 1993 under contract with the NSF, consisting of [[Network Solutions|Network Solutions, Inc.]], [[General Atomics]] and [[AT&T]]. The General Atomics contract was canceled after several years due to performance issues.\n\n20th century WHOIS servers were highly permissive and would allow wild-card searches. A WHOIS query of a person's last name would yield all individuals with that name. A query with a given keyword returned all registered domains containing that keyword. A query for a given administrative contact returned all domains the administrator was associated with. Since the advent of the commercialized Internet, [[Domain Registrars|multiple registrars]] and unethical spammers, such permissive searching is no longer available.\n\nOn December 1, 1999, management of the [[top-level domain]]s (TLDs) <tt>com</tt>, <tt>net</tt>, and <tt>org</tt> was assigned to [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers|ICANN]]. At the time, these TLDs were converted to a thin WHOIS model<!-- please, see discussion page-->. Existing WHOIS clients stopped working at that time. A month later, it had self-detecting [[Common Gateway Interface]] support so that the same program could operate a web-based WHOIS lookup, and an external TLD table to support multiple WHOIS servers based on the TLD of the request. This eventually became the model of the modern WHOIS client.\n\nBy 2005, there were many more generic top-level domains than there had been in the early 1980s. There are also many more country-code top-level domains. This has led to a complex network of [[domain name registrar]]s and registrar associations, especially as the management of Internet infrastructure has become more internationalized. As such, performing a WHOIS query on a domain requires knowing the correct, authoritative WHOIS server to use. Tools to do WHOIS proxy searches have become common.\n\n===CRISP and IRIS===\nIn 2003, an [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] committee was formed to create a new standard for looking up information on domain names and network numbers: [[Cross Registry Information Service Protocol]] (CRISP).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Murphy|first1=Cathy|title=CRISP (Cross-Registry Information Service Protocol) Working Group Meeting Minutes|url=https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/58/104.htm|website=Internet Engineering Task Force|publisher=IETF|accessdate=1 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601224705/https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/58/104.htm|archivedate=1 June 2015|location=Minneapolis, Minnesota USA|date=2 October 2003|quote=The CRISP (Cross-Registry Information Service Protocol) WG will define a standard mechanism that can be used for finding authoritative information associated with a label, a protocol to transport queries and responses for accessing that information, and a first profile (schema & queries) to support commonly-required queries for domain registration information. }}</ref>  Between January 2005 and July 2006, the working name for this proposed new standard was [[Internet Registry Information Service]] (IRIS) <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Newton|first1=Andrew|title=Replacing the Whois Protocol: IRIS and the IETF's CRISP Working Group|journal=IEEE Internet Computing|date=July 2006|volume=10|issue=4|pages=79\u201384|doi=10.1109/MIC.2006.86|url=http://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/ic/2006/04/w4079-abs.html|accessdate=1 June 2015|quote=The Nicname/Whois protocol has served well, but it remains unchanged since it was first published in the early 1980s, despite great change in the infrastructure and administration of the Internet.

The NICNAME/WHOIS protocol was first described in <nowiki>RFC 812</nowiki> in 1982 by Ken Harrenstien and Vic White of the Network Information Center at [[SRI International]].\n\nWHOIS was originally implemented on the [[Network Control Program]] (NCP) but found its major use when the [[Internet Protocol Suite|TCP/IP]] suite was standardized across the ARPANET and later the Internet.\n\nThe protocol specification is the following (original quote):<ref>RFC 812: ''NICNAME/WHOIS'', K.Harrenstien, V.White (1982)</ref>\n\n<blockquote><pre>Connect to the service host\n   TCP: service port 43 decimal\n   NCP: ICP to socket 43 decimal, establishing two 8-bit connections\nSend a single \"command line\", ending with <CRLF>.\nReceive information in response to the command line.  The\nserver closes its connections as soon as the output is\nfinished.</pre></blockquote>\n\nThe ''command line'' server query is normally a single name specification. i.e. the name of a resource. However, servers accept a query, consisting of only the question mark (?) to return a description of acceptable command line formats. Substitution or ''wild-card'' formats also exist, e.g., appending a [[full-stop]] (period) to the query name returns all entries beginning with the query name.\n\nOn the modern Internet, WHOIS services are typically communicated using the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP). Servers listen to requests on the well-known [[port number]] 43. Clients are simple applications that establish a communications channel to the server, transmit a text record with the name of the resource to be queried and await the response in form of a sequence of text records found in the database. This simplicity of the protocol also permits an application, and a command line interface user, to query a WHOIS server using the [[Telnet]] protocol.\n\n==Implementation==\nWHOIS lookups were traditionally performed with a [[command line interface]] application, but now many alternative web-based tools exist. WHOIS has a sister protocol called ''Referral Whois'' ([[RWhois]]).\n\nA WHOIS database consists of a set of text records for each resource. These text records consists of various items of information about the resource itself, and any associated information of assignees, registrants, administrative information, such as creation and expiration dates.\n\nTwo data models exist for storing resource information in a WHOIS database, the ''thick'' and the ''thin'' model.\n\n===Thin and thick lookups===\nWHOIS information can be stored and looked up according to either a ''thick'' or a ''thin'' data model:\n\n; Thick: A Thick WHOIS server stores the complete WHOIS information from all the registrars for the particular set of data (so that one WHOIS server can respond with WHOIS information on all [[.org]] domains, for example).\n; Thin: A Thin WHOIS server stores only the name of the WHOIS server of the registrar of a domain, which in turn has the full details on the data being looked up (such as the [[.com]] WHOIS servers, which refer the WHOIS query to the registrar where the domain was registered).\n\nThe thick model usually ensures consistent data and slightly faster queries, since only one WHOIS server needs to be contacted.  If a registrar goes out of business, a thick registry contains all important information (if the registrant entered correct data, and privacy features were not used to obscure the data) and registration information can be retained. But with a thin registry, the contact information might not be available, and it could be difficult for the rightful registrant to retain control of the domain.<ref name=\"circleid.com\">[http://www.circleid.com/posts/com_net_thick_or_thin/ Circleid.com]</ref>\n\nIf a WHOIS client did not understand how to deal with this situation, it would display the full information from the registrar. Unfortunately, the WHOIS protocol has no standard for determining how to distinguish the thin model from the thick model.\n\nSpecific details of which records are stored vary among [[Domain name registry|domain name registries]]. Some [[top-level domain]]s, including <tt>[[.com|com]]</tt> and <tt>[[.net|net]]</tt>, operate a thin WHOIS, requiring domain registrars to maintain their own customers' data. The other global top-level registries, including <tt>[[.org|org]]</tt>, operate a thick model.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icann.org/en/topics/new-gtlds/thick-thin-whois-30may09-en.pdf |title=Thick vs. Thin Whois for New gTLDs |author=Sarah Stoll |date=30 May 2009 |accessdate=17 September 2011 |work=memorandum |publisher=[[ICANN]]|quote=Current gTLD registry agreements vary between thin and thick Whois outputs: com, net and jobs are thin; all other gTLD agreements \u2013 aero, asia, biz, cat, coop, info, mobi, museum, name, org, pro, tel, travel \u2013 are thick. }}</ref> Each country-code top-level registry has its own national rules.\n\n===Software===\nThe first applications written for the WHOIS information system were [[command line interface]] tools for [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] operating systems (i.e. Solaris, Linux etc.). WHOIS client and server software is distributed as free [[open-source software]] and binary distributions are included with all [[Unix-like]] systems. Various commercial Unix implementations may use a proprietary implementation (for example, [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] 7).\n\nA WHOIS command line client passes a phrase given as an argument directly to the WHOIS server. Various free open source examples can still be found on sites such as sourceforge.net. However, most modern WHOIS tools implement command line flags or options, such as the -h option to access a specific server host, but default servers are preconfigured. Additional options may allow control of the [[port number]] to connect on, displaying additional debugging data, or changing recursion/referral behavior.\n\nLike most TCP/IP [[client-server]] applications, a WHOIS client takes the user input and then opens an [[Internet socket]] to its destination server. The WHOIS protocol manages the transmission of the query and reception of results.\n\n===Web===\nWith the advent of the [[World Wide Web]] and especially the loosening up of the [[Network Solutions]] monopoly, looking up WHOIS information via the web has become quite common. At present, popular web-based WHOIS-queries may be conducted from [[ARIN]],<ref>[http://whois.arin.net/ui ARIN WHOIS]</ref> [[RIPE]]<ref>[http://www.db.ripe.net/whois RIPE WHOIS]</ref> and [[APNIC]].<ref>[http://www.apnic.net/apnic-info/whois_search2 APNIC WHOIS]</ref> Most early web-based WHOIS clients were merely front-ends to a command-line client, where the resulting output just gets displayed on a web page with little, if any, clean-up or formatting.\n\nCurrently, web based WHOIS clients usually perform the WHOIS queries directly and then format the results for display. Many such clients are proprietary, authored by domain name registrars.\n\nThe need for web-based clients came from the fact that command-line WHOIS clients largely existed only in the Unix and large computing worlds. [[Microsoft Windows]] and Macintosh computers had no WHOIS clients installed by default, so registrars had to find a way to provide access to WHOIS data for potential customers. Many end-users still rely on such clients, even though command line and graphical clients exist now for most home PC platforms. Microsoft provides the [http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb842062 Sysinternals Suite] that includes a whois client at no cost.\n\nThere are also many sites not owned by registrars or Internet-related companies. These support most of main [[TLD]] and remain free. But most of web-based whois sites are incomplete and do not support all TLD nor IP search.<ref>[http://www.ip-adress.com/whois IP WHOIS]</ref>\n\nSome work from a built-in WHOIS server list and some other try to retrieve the one which fits the  TLD you ask for from a live [[Domain Information Groper]] query (command line clients do this query in background first).\n\n[[CPAN]] has several [[Perl]] modules available that work with WHOIS servers. Many of them are not current and do not fully function with the current (2005) WHOIS server infrastructure. However, there is still much useful functionality to derive including looking up [[Autonomous System (Internet)|AS numbers]] and registrant contacts.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\n==Servers==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Regional Internet registries===\n[[Image:Regional Internet Registries world map.svg|thumb|Regional Internet Registries]]\nWHOIS servers operated by [[Regional Internet Registries]] (RIR) can be queried directly to determine the [[Internet Service Provider]] responsible for a particular resource.\n\nThe records of each of these registries are cross-referenced, so that a query to [[ARIN]] for a record which belongs to [[RIPE]] will return a place-holder pointing to the RIPE WHOIS server. This lets the WHOIS user making the query know that the detailed information resides on the RIPE server. In addition to the RIRs servers, commercial services exist, such as the [[Routing Assets Database]] used by some large networks  (e.g., large Internet providers that acquired other ISPs in several RIR areas).\n\n===Server discovery===\nThere is currently no standard for determining the responsible WHOIS server for a DNS domain, though a number of methods are in common use for [[top-level domain]]s (TLDs). Some WHOIS lookups require searching the procuring domain registrar to display domain owner details.\n\n==Query example==\nNormally the contact information of the resources assignee is returned. However, some registrars offer private registration, in which case the contact information of the registrar is shown instead.\n\nSome registry operators are wholesalers, meaning that they typically provide domain name services to a large number of retail registrars, who in turn offer them to consumers. For private registration, only the identity of the wholesale registrar may be returned. In this case, the identity of the individual as well as the retail registrar may be hidden.\n\nBelow is an example of WHOIS data returned for an individual resource holder. This is the result of a WHOIS query of [[example.com]]:\n<source lang=\"whois\">\nwhois example.com\n[Querying whois.verisign-grs.com]\n[Redirected to whois.iana.org]\n[Querying whois.iana.org]\n[whois.iana.org]\n% IANA WHOIS server\n% for more information on IANA, visit http://www.iana.org\n% This query returned 1 object\ndomain:       EXAMPLE.COM\norganisation: Internet Assigned Numbers Authority\ncreated:      1992-01-01\nsource:       IANA\n</source>\n\n{{anchor|RWhois}}\n\n==Referral Whois==\n'''Referral Whois''' ('''RWhois''') is an extension of the original Whois protocol and service. RWhois extends the concepts of Whois in a [[Scalability|scalable]], hierarchical fashion, potentially creating a system with a tree-like architecture. Queries are deterministically routed to servers based on hierarchical labels, reducing a query to the primary repository of information.<ref name=rfc1714>RFC 1714, ''Referral Whois Protocol (RWhois)'', S. Williamson, M. Kosters (November 1994)</ref>\n\nLookups of IP address allocations are often limited to the larger [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) blocks (e.g., /24, /22, /16), because usually only the [[Regional Internet registry|regional Internet registries]] (RIRs) and [[domain registrars]] run RWhois or Whois servers, although RWhois is intended to be run by even smaller [[Local Internet Registry|local Internet registries]], to provide more granular information about IP address assignment.\n\nRWhois is intended to replace Whois, providing an organized hierarchy of referral services where one could connect to any RWhois server, request a look-up and be automatically re-directed to the correct server(s). However, while the technical functionality is in place, adoption of the RWhois standard has been weak.\n\nRWhois services are typically communicated using the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP). Servers listen to requests on the well-known [[port number]] 4321.\n\nRwhois was first specified in <nowiki>RFC 1714</nowiki> in 1994 by [[Network Solutions]],<ref name=rfc1714/> but the specification was superseded in 1997 by RFC 2167.<ref name=rfc2167>RFC 2167, ''Referral Whois (RWhois) V1.5'', S. Williamson, M. Kosters, D. Blacka, J. Singh, K. Zeilstra (June 1997)</ref>\n\nThe referral features of RWhois are different than the feature of a Whois server to refer responses to another server, which RWhois also implements.\n\n==Criticism==\nOne criticism of WHOIS is the lack of full access to the data.<ref>{{cite web|title=Battle Begins Over IP Address Whois Data|url=http://www.internetgovernance.org/2011/02/12/battle-begins-over-ip-address-whois-data/|publisher=Internet Governance Project|accessdate=4 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=WHOIS Privacy Plan Draws Fire|url=http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/09/whois-privacy-plan-draws-fire/|publisher=KerbsonSecurity|accessdate=4 April 2015}}</ref>  Few parties have realtime access to the complete databases. Others cite the competing goal of [[domain privacy]] as a criticism although this problem is strongly mitigated by [[domain privacy]] services. Currently the ''Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers'' ([[ICANN]]) broadly requires that the [[mail]]ing [[Address (geography)|address]], [[phone number]] and [[e-mail address]] of those owning or administrating a domain name to be made publicly available through the \"WHOIS\" directories.  The registrant's (domain owner's) contact details, such as address and telephone number, are easily accessible to anyone who queries a WHOIS server. However, that policy enables spammers, direct marketers, identity thieves, or other attackers to loot the directory for personal information about these people. Although ICANN has been exploring changing WHOIS to enable greater privacy, there is a lack of consensus among major stakeholders as to what type of change should be made.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Privacy Conundrum in Domain Registration|url=http://www.actnowdomains.com/the-privacy-conundrum-in-domain-registration.htm|publisher=Act Now Domains|accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref>  Some domain registrars offer private registrations (also known as [[domain privacy]]), by which the contact information of the registrar is shown instead of the customer's. With the offer of private registration from many registrars, some of the risk has been mitigated.\n\nStudies have shown that spammers can and do harvest plain-text email addresses from WHOIS servers.<ref name=\"icann_whois_spam_study\">[http://www.icann.org/en/committees/security/sac023.pdf \"SAC 023: Is the WHOIS Service a Source for email Addresses for Spammers?\"], [[ICANN]] Security and Stability Advisory Committee, October 2007</ref> For this reason, some WHOIS servers and websites offering WHOIS queries have implemented rate-limiting systems, such as web-based [[CAPTCHA]] and limited amounts of search queries per user [[IP address]].\n\nThe WHOIS protocol was not written with an international audience in mind. A WHOIS server and/or client cannot determine the text encoding in effect for the query or the database content. Many servers were originally using US-[[ASCII]] and Internationalization concerns weren't taken into consideration until much later.<ref>[http://www.icann.org/en/news/presentations/klensin-whois-carthage-29oct03-en.pdf \"WHOIS Internalization Issues\"], November 2012</ref> This might impact the usability or usefulness of the WHOIS protocol in countries outside the USA.<ref name=rfc3912/> In the case of [[internationalized domain names]] it is the responsibility of the client application to perform the translation of the domain name between its native language script and the DNS name in [[punycode]].\n\n==Accuracy of information==\nIn cases where the registrant's (Domain Owner) identity is public, anyone can easily confirm the status of a domain via WHOIS.\n\nIn the case of private registrations, ascertaining registration information may be more difficult. If a registrant, who acquired a domain name, wants to verify the registrar has completed the registration process, three steps may be required: \n# Perform a WHOIS and confirm that the resource is at least registered with ICANN, \n# Determine the name of the wholesale registrar, and \n# Contact the wholesaler and obtain the name of the retail registrar.\n\nThis provides some confidence that the retailer actually registered the name. But if the registrar goes out of business, such as the failure of [[RegisterFly]] in 2007, the rightful domain holder with privacy-protected registrations may have difficulty regaining back the administration of his/her domain name.<ref name=\"circleid.com\"/> Registrants using \"private registration\" can attempt to protect themselves by using a registrar that places customer data in escrow with a third party.\n\nICANN requires that each registrant of domain name be given the opportunity to correct any inaccurate contact data associated with his/her domain. For this reason, registrars are required to periodically send the holder the contact information on record for verification, but they do not provide any guarantee about the accuracy of information if the registrant provided inaccurate information.\n\n==Law and policy==\nWHOIS has generated policy issues in the United States federal government. As noted above, WHOIS creates a [[privacy]] issue which is also tied to [[free speech]] and [[anonymity]]. However, WHOIS is an important tool for law enforcement officers investigating violations like [[Spam (electronic)|spam]] and [[phishing]] to track down the holders of domain names. As a result, law enforcement agencies have sought to make WHOIS records both open and verified:<ref>[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2006/07/whoisdb.htm FTC Calls for Openness, Accessibility in Whois Database System, FTC 7/18/2006]</ref>\n\n*The [[Federal Trade Commission]] has testified about how inaccurate WHOIS records thwart their investigations.<ref>[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2002/05/whois.htm FTC Testimony on WHOIS, FTC 5/22/02]</ref>\n*Congressional hearings have been conducted about the importance of WHOIS in 2001, 2002 and 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.com.com/2100-1023-269829.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050827160954/http://news.com.com/2100-1023-269829.html|title=Whois at heart of congressional hearings|publisher=[[CNET]]|first=Lisa|last=Bowman|date=11 July 2001|archive-date=27 August 2005}}</ref>\n*The ''Fraudulent Online Identity Sanctions Act''<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d108:h.r.03754: THOMAS]</ref> \"make it a violation of trademark and copyright law if a person knowingly provided, or caused to be provided, materially false contact information in making, maintaining, or renewing the registration of a domain name used in connection with the violation,\"<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d108:h.r.03754: Fraudulent Online Identity Sanctions Act]</ref> where the latter \"violation\" refers to a prior violation of trademark or copyright law.

It recommends that WHOIS be replaced with a system that keeps information secret from most Internet users, and only discloses information for \"permissible purposes.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Initial Report from the Expert Working Group on gTLD Directory Services: A Next Generation Registration Directory Service|url=https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/initial-report-24jun13-en.pdf|website=whois.icann.org|publisher=ICANN|date=24 June 2013|accessdate=24 March 2015}}</ref> ICANN's list of permissible purposes includes domain-name research, domain-name sale and purchase, regulatory enforcement, personal data protection, legal actions, and abuse mitigation.<ref>http://newlegalreview.cpaglobal.com/icann-earmarks-domains-record-whois-scrapheap/</ref> Although WHOIS has been a key tool of journalists in determining who was disseminating certain information on the Internet,<ref>http://jour.sc.edu/news/csj/CSJNov04.html</ref> the use of WHOIS by the free press is not included in ICANN\u2019s proposed list of permissible purposes.\n\nThe EWG collected public input on the initial report until 13 September 2013.
