The degree of wetting (wettability) is determined by a force balance between [[adhesion|adhesive]] and [[cohesion (chemistry)|cohesive]] [[force]]s. Wetting deals with the three phases of materials: gas, liquid, and solid. It is now a center of attention in nanotechnology and nanoscience studies due to the advent of many nanomaterials in the past two decades (e.g. [[graphene]],<ref>J Rafiee, X Mi, H Gullapalli, AV Thomas, F Yavari, Y Shi, PM Ajayan, NA Koratkar, Wetting transparency of graphene, Nature Materials 11 (3), 217-222.</ref> [[Carbon nano tube|carbon nanotube]]).\n\nWetting is important in the [[Chemical bond|bonding]] or [[adhesion|adherence]] of two materials. Wetting and the surface forces that control wetting are also responsible for other related effects, including [[capillary action|capillary]] effects.\n\nThere are two types of wetting: non-reactive wetting and active wetting.<ref>Dezellus, O. and N.

The contact angle is determined by the result between adhesive and cohesive forces. As the tendency of a drop to spread out over a flat, solid surface increases, the contact angle decreases. Thus, the contact angle provides an inverse measure of wettability.<ref name=\"sharfin\">{{cite journal|first = E.|last = Sharfrin|title = Constitutive relations in the wetting of low energy surfaces and the theory of the retraction method of preparing monolayers|journal = The Journal of Physical Chemistry|volume = 64|issue= 5|pages = 519\u2013524|year = 1960|doi = 10.1021/j100834a002|last2 = Zisman|first2 = William A.}}</ref>\n\nA contact angle less than 90\u00b0 (low contact angle) usually indicates that wetting of the surface is very favorable, and the fluid will spread over a large area of the surface. Contact angles greater than 90\u00b0 (high contact angle) generally means that wetting of the surface is unfavorable, so the fluid will minimize contact with the surface and form a compact liquid droplet.\n \nFor water, a wettable surface may also be termed [[hydrophilic]] and a nonwettable surface [[hydrophobic]]. Superhydrophobic surfaces have contact angles greater than 150\u00b0, showing almost no contact between the liquid drop and the surface. This is sometimes referred to as the \"[[Lotus effect]]\". The table describes varying contact angles and their corresponding solid/liquid and liquid/liquid interactions.<ref name=\"Eustat\">{{cite book|first = N.| last = Eustathopoulos |author2=Nicholas, M.G. |author3=Drevet B.|title = Wettability at high temperatures|publisher = Pergamon|location = Oxford, UK|year = 1999|isbn = 0-08-042146-6}}</ref> For nonwater liquids, the term lyophilic is used for low contact angle conditions and lyophobic is used when higher contact angles result. Similarly, the terms omniphobic and omniphilic apply to both polar and apolar liquids.\n\n==High-energy vs. low-energy surfaces==\n\nLiquids can interact with two main types of solid surfaces. Traditionally, solid surfaces have been divided into high-[[energy]] solids and low-energy types. The relative energy of a solid has to do with the bulk nature of the solid itself. Solids such as metals, [[glass]]es, and [[ceramic]]s are known as 'hard solids' because the [[chemical bond]]s that hold them together (e.g., covalent, ionic, or metallic) are very strong. Thus, it takes a large input of energy to break these solids (alternatively large amount of energy is required to cut the bulk and make two separate surfaces so high surface energy), so they are termed \u201chigh energy\u201d. Most molecular liquids achieve complete wetting with high-energy surfaces.\n\nThe other type of solids is weak molecular crystals (e.g., fluorocarbons, hydrocarbons, etc.) where the molecules are held together essentially by physical forces (e.g., van der Waals and hydrogen bonds). Since these solids are held together by weak forces, a very low input of energy is required to break them, thus they are termed \u201clow energy\u201d. Depending on the type of liquid chosen, low-energy surfaces can permit either complete or partial wetting.<ref>{{cite book|first = M.E| last = Schrader|author2=Loeb, G.I. |title = Modern Approaches to Wettability.

[[William Zisman]] had several key findings in the work that he did:<ref name=\"Johnson\"/>\n\nZisman observed that cos \u03b8 increases linearly as the [[surface tension]] (\u03b3<sub>LV</sub>) of the liquid decreased. Thus, he was able to establish a [[linear function]] between cos \u03b8 and the surface tension (\u03b3<sub>LV</sub>) for various [[organic compound|organic]] liquids.\n\nA surface is more wettable when \u03b3<sub>LV</sub> and \u03b8 is low. Zisman termed the intercept of these lines when cos \u03b8 = 1, as the [[critical surface tension]] (\u03b3<sub>c</sub>) of that surface. This critical surface tension is an important parameter because it is a characteristic of only the solid.\n\nKnowing the critical surface tension of a solid, it is possible to predict the wettability of the surface.<ref name=\"sharfin\"/> \nThe wettability of a surface is determined by the outermost chemical groups of the solid.\nDifferences in wettability between surfaces that are similar in structure are due to differences in packing of the atoms. For instance, if a surface has branched chains, it will have poorer packing than a surface with straight chains.\n\n==Ideal solid surfaces==\nAn [[ideal surface]] is flat, rigid, perfectly smooth, and chemically homogeneous, and has zero contact angle hysteresis. Zero [[hysteresis]] implies the advancing and receding contact angles are equal. In other words, only one thermodynamically stable contact angle exists. When a drop of liquid is placed on such a surface, the characteristic contact angle is formed as depicted in Fig. 1. Furthermore, on an ideal surface, the drop will return to its original shape if it is disturbed.<ref name=\"Eustat\"/><ref name=\"Johnson\">Johnson, Rulon E. (1993) in ''Wettability'' Ed. Berg, John.

Figure 6 depicts the advancing and receding contact angles. The advancing contact angle is the maximum stable angle, whereas the receding contact angle is the minimum stable angle. Contact-angle hysteresis occurs because many different thermodynamically stable contact angles are found on a nonideal solid. These varying thermodynamically stable contact angles are known as metastable states.<ref name = \"Johnson\"/>\n\nSuch motion of a phase boundary, involving advancing and receding contact angles, is known as dynamic wetting. When a contact line advances, covering more of the surface with liquid, the contact angle is increased and generally is related to the velocity of the contact line.<ref>{{cite book|first = P. G.|last = De Gennes|title = Soft Interfaces|year = 1994|publisher = Cambridge University Press|location = Cambridge, UK|isbn = 0-521-56417-4}}</ref> If the velocity of a contact line is increased without bound, the contact angle increases, and as it approaches 180\u00b0, the gas phase will become entrained in a thin layer between the liquid and solid. This is a kinetic nonequilibrium effect which results from the contact line moving at such a high speed that complete wetting cannot occur.\n\nA well-known departure from ideality is when the surface of interest has a rough texture. The rough texture of a surface can fall into one of two categories: homogeneous or heterogeneous. A homogeneous wetting regime is where the liquid fills in the roughness grooves of a surface. A heterogeneous wetting regime, though,  is where the surface is a composite of two types of patches. An important example of such a composite surface is one composed of patches of both air and solid. Such surfaces have varied effects on the contact angles of wetting liquids. Cassie\u2013Baxter and Wenzel are the two main models that attempt to describe the wetting of textured surfaces. However, these equations only apply when the drop size is sufficiently large compared with the surface roughness scale.<ref name = \"abraham\">{{cite journal|author = Abraham Marmur|title = Wetting of Hydrophobic Rough Surfaces: To be heterogeneous or not to be| year = 2003|journal = Langmuir|volume = 19|pages = 8343\u20138348|doi = 10.1021/la0344682|issue = 20}}</ref> When the droplet size is comparable to that of the underlying pillars, the effect of line tension should be considered. .<ref>Xuemei Chen, Ruiyuan Ma, Jintao Li,  Chonglei Hao, Wei Guo, B.L.Luk, Shuaicheng Li, Shuhuai Yao, Zuankai Wang.

Wenzel 1936) describes the homogeneous wetting regime, as seen in Figure 7, and is defined by the following equation for the contact angle on a rough surface:<ref name = \"abraham\"/> \n:<math>\\cos\\,{\\theta^*}= r \\cos\\,{\\theta}</math>\nwhere <math>\\theta^*</math> is the apparent contact angle which corresponds to the stable equilibrium state (i.e. minimum free energy state for the system). The [[roughness ratio]], r, is a measure of how surface roughness affects a homogeneous surface. The roughness ratio is defined as the ratio of true area of the solid surface to the apparent area.\n\n\u03b8 is the [[Young contact angle]] as defined for an ideal surface. Although Wenzel's equation demonstrates the contact angle of a rough surface is different from the [[intrinsic]] contact angle, it does not describe contact angle [[Hysteresis#Contact angle hysteresis|hysteresis]].<ref name=\"marmur\">Marmur, Abraham (1992) in ''Modern Approach to Wettability: Theory and Applications'' Schrader, Malcolm E. and Loeb, George New York: Plenum Press</ref>\n\n===Cassie\u2013Baxter model===\n[[File:Cassie-Baxter.png|thumb|left|Figure 8: Cassie\u2013Baxter model]]\n\nWhen dealing with a heterogeneous surface, the Wenzel model is not sufficient. A more complex model is needed to measure how the apparent contact angle changes when various materials are involved. This heterogeneous surface, like that seen in Figure 8, is explained using the Cassie\u2013Baxter equation ([[Cassie's law]]):<ref name=\"abraham\"/>\n\n:<math>\\cos\\,{\\theta^*}= r_{f}\\,f \\,\\cos\\,{\\theta_\\text{Y}}+f-1</math>\n\nHere the ''r<sub>f</sub>'' is the roughness ratio of the wet surface area and ''f'' is the fraction of solid surface area wet by the liquid.

On the other hand, when there are many different fractions of surface roughness, each fraction of the total surface area is denoted by <math>f_{i}</math>.\n\nA summation of all ''f<sub>i</sub>'' equals 1 or the total surface.

This is because of the assumption that the surface of air that is exposed is under the droplet and is the only other substrate in the system. Subsequently the equation is then expressed as (1 \u2013 ''f''). Therefore, the Cassie equation can be easily derived from the Cassie\u2013Baxter equation. Experimental results regarding the surface properties of Wenzel versus Cassie\u2013Baxter systems showed the effect of pinning for a Young angle of 180 to 90\u00b0, a region classified under the Cassie\u2013Baxter model. This liquid/air composite system is largely hydrophobic. After that point, a sharp transition to the Wenzel regime was found where the drop wets the surface, but no further than edges of the drop.\n\n====Precursor film====\n\nWith the advent of high resolution imaging, researchers have started to obtain experimental data which have led them to question the assumptions of the Cassie\u2013Baxter equation when calculating the apparent contact angle. These groups believe the apparent contact angle is largely dependent on the triple line. The triple line, which is in contact with the heterogeneous surface, cannot rest on the heterogeneous surface like the rest of the drop. In theory, it should follow the surface imperfection. This bending in triple line is unfavorable and is not seen in real-world situations. A theory that preserves the Cassie\u2013Baxter equation while at the same time explaining the presence of minimized energy state of the triple line hinges on the idea of a precursor film. This film of submicrometer thickness advances ahead of the motion of the droplet and is found around the triple line. Furthermore, this precursor film allows the triple line to bend and take different conformations that were originally considered unfavorable. This precursor fluid has been observed using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) in surfaces with pores formed in the bulk. With the introduction of the precursor film concept, the triple line can follow energetically feasible conformations and thereby correctly explaining the Cassie\u2013Baxter model.<ref name=Bormashenko>{{cite journal|first = E.|last = Bormashenko| title = Why does the Cassie\u2013Baxter equation apply?| journal = Colloids and Surface A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects| volume = 324| pages = 47\u201350|year = 2008|doi = 10.1016/j.colsurfa.2008.13.025}}</ref>\n\n====\"Petal effect\" vs. \"lotus effect\"<ref>{{cite journal|first = F.|last = Lin|title = Petal Effect: Two major examples of the Cassie\u2013Baxter model are the \"Petal Effect\" and Lotus Effect\".

The red rose takes advantage of this by using a hierarchy of micro- and nanostructures on each petal to provide sufficient roughness for superhydrophobicity. More specifically, each rose petal has a collection of micropapillae on the surface and each papilla, in turn, has many nanofolds. The term \u201cpetal effect\u201d describes the fact that a water droplet on the surface of a rose petal is spherical in shape, but cannot roll off even if the petal is turned upside down. The water drops maintain their spherical shape due to the superhydrophobicity of the petal (contact angle of about 152.4\u00b0), but do not roll off because the petal surface has a high adhesive force with water.\n\nWhen comparing the \"petal effect\" to the \"lotus effect\", it is important to note some striking differences. The surface structure of the lotus leaf and the rose petal, as seen in Figure 9, can be used to explain the two different effects. The lotus petal has a randomly rough surface and low contact angle hysteresis, which means the water droplet is not able to wet the microstructure spaces between the spikes. This allows air to remain inside the texture, causing a heterogeneous surface composed of both air and solid. As a result, the adhesive force between the water and the solid surface is extremely low, allowing the water to roll off easily (i.e. \"self-cleaning\" phenomenon).\n\nThe rose petal's micro- and nanostructures are larger in scale than those of the lotus leaf, which allows the liquid film to impregnate the texture. However, as seen in Figure 9, the liquid can enter the larger-scale grooves, but it cannot enter into the smaller grooves. This is known as the Cassie impregnating wetting regime. Since the liquid can wet the larger-scale grooves, the adhesive force between the water and solid is very high. This explains why the water droplet will not fall off even if the petal is tilted at an angle or turned upside down. This effect will fail if the droplet has a volume larger than 10 \u00b5l because the balance between weight and surface tension is surpassed.\n\n===Cassie\u2013Baxter to Wenzel transition===\n[[File:Cassie transition.png|thumb|right|Figure 10: Mushroom state]]\nIn the [[Cassie's law|Cassie\u2013Baxter model]], the drop sits on top of the textured surface with trapped air underneath. During the [[wetting transition]] from the Cassie state to the Wenzel state, the air pockets are no longer thermodynamically stable and liquid begins to nucleate from the middle of the drop, creating a \u201cmushroom state\u201d as seen in Figure 10.<ref name=Ishino>{{Cite journal|first = C.|last = Ishino|title = Wetting transitions on textured hydrophilic surfaces|journal = European Physical Journal|volume = 25|pages = 415\u2013424|year = 2008|doi = 10.1140/epje/i2007-10308-y|pmid = 18431542|last2 = Okumura|first2 = K|issue = 4|bibcode = 2008EPJE...25..415I }}</ref> The penetration condition is given by:\n:<math>\\cos\\,{\\theta_\\text{C}}= \\frac {\\phi-1}{r-\\phi}\\ </math>\n\nwhere\n:*''\u03b8<sub>C</sub>'' is the critical contact angle\n:*''\u03a6'' is the fraction of solid/liquid interface where drop is in contact with surface\n:*''r'' is solid roughness (for flat surface, r = 1)\n\n[[File:Wenzel film.png|thumb|left|Figure 11: Penetration front spreads beyond drop]]\n\nThe penetration front propagates to minimize the surface energy until it reaches the edges of the drop, thus arriving at the Wenzel state. Since the solid can be considered an absorptive material due to its surface roughness, this phenomenon of spreading and imbibition is called hemiwicking. The contact angles at which spreading/imbibition occurs are between 0 and \u03c0/2.<ref>{{cite journal|first = D.|last = Quere |title = Wetting of Textured Surfaces|journal = Colloids and Surfaces|pages = 41\u201346|year = 2008|doi=10.1016/S0927-7757(02)00061-4|volume =206|issue =1\u20133|url=http://www.pmmh.espci.fr/~jbico/bico02b.pdf|last2 = Thiele|first2 = Uwe|last3 = Qu\u00e9r\u00e9|first3 = David}}</ref>\n\nThe Wenzel model is valid between \u03b8<sub>C</sub> and \u03c0/2. If the contact angle is less than \u0398<sub>''C''</sub>, the penetration front spreads beyond the drop and a liquid film forms over the surface. Figure 11 depicts the transition from the Wenzel state to the surface film state. The film smoothes the surface roughness and the Wenzel model no longer applies.

Generally, the rougher the surface, the more hydrophobic it is.\n\n==Spreading dynamics==\n\nIf a drop is placed on a smooth, horizontal surface, it is generally not in the equilibrium state. Hence, it spreads until an equilibrium contact radius is reached (partial wetting). While taking into account capillary, gravitational, and viscous contributions, the drop radius as a function of time can be expressed as<ref>H\u00e4rth M., Schubert D.W., ''Simple Approach for Spreading Dynamics of Polymeric Fluids'', Macromol.

When a drop is placed on a surface, it can completely wet, partially wet, or not wet the surface. By reducing the surface tension with [[surfactants]], a nonwetting material can be made to become partially or completely wetting. The excess free energy (\u03c3) of a drop on a solid surface is:<ref name=\"Lee\"/>\n:<math>\\sigma={\\gamma}S+PV+{\\pi}\\,R^2({\\gamma_\\text{SL}}-{\\gamma_\\text{SV}})</math>\n\n:*''\u03b3'' is the liquid\u2013vapor interfacial tension\n:*\u03b3<sub>SL</sub> is the solid\u2013liquid interfacial tension\n:*\u03b3<sub>SV</sub> is the solid\u2013vapor interfacial tension\n:*''S'' is the area of liquid\u2013vapor interface\n:*''P'' is the excess pressure inside liquid\n:*''R'' is the radius of droplet base\n\nBased on this equation, the excess free energy is minimized when \u03b3 decreases, \u03b3<sub>SL</sub> decreases, or \u03b3<sub>SV</sub> increases. Surfactants are absorbed onto the liquid\u2013vapor, solid\u2013liquid, and solid\u2013vapor interfaces, which modify the wetting behavior of hydrophobic materials to reduce the free energy. When surfactants are absorbed onto a hydrophobic surface, the polar head groups face into the solution with the tail pointing outward. In more hydrophobic surfaces, surfactants may form a bilayer on the solid, causing it to become more hydrophilic. The dynamic drop radius can be characterized as the drop begins to spread. Thus, the contact angle changes based on the following equation:<ref name=Lee>{{cite journal|author = K.S.

As a result, the drop spreads.\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin|3}}\n*[[Adsorption]]\n*[[Amott index]]\n*[[Anti-fog]]\n*[[Contact angle]]\n*[[Rise In Core - An alternate Reservoir Wettability Characterization Method]]\n*[[Dewetting]]\n*[[Electrowetting]]\n*[[Buoyancy|Flotation]]\n*[[Sessile drop technique]]\n*[[Soap bubble]]\n\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|last1=de Gennes|first1=Pierre-Gilles|last2=Brochard-Wyart|first2=Fran\u00e7oise|last3=Qu\u00e9r\u00e9|first3=David|title=Capillarity and Wetting Phenomena|year=2004|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-21656-0|isbn=978-1-4419-1833-8|publisher=Springer New York}}\n* {{cite book|author1=Victor M.
