The crew, payload, fuel, and equipment are typically housed inside the main wing structure, although a flying wing may have various small protuberances such as pods, [[nacelle]]s, blisters, booms, or [[vertical stabilizer]]s.<ref name=\"Crane\">Crane, Dale: ''Dictionary of Aeronautical Terms'', third edition, p. 224.

These types include [[blended wing body]] aircraft, and [[microlight aircraft|microlights]] (such as the [[A\u00e9riane Swift]]), which typically carry the pilot (and engine when fitted) below the wing.\n\n==History==\n[[File:XB-35.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Northrop YB-35]] bomber prototype began its development during World War II.]]\n\n[[Tailless aircraft]] have been experimented with since the earliest attempts to fly. From 1910 [[John William Dunne]]'s swept-wing biplane and monoplane designs displayed inherent stability.\n\n[[Hugo Junkers]] patented a wing-only air transport concept around the same time, in 1910.  He saw it as a natural solution to the problem of building an [[airliner]] large enough to carry a reasonable passenger load and enough fuel to cross the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] in regular service.  He believed that the flying wing's potentially large internal volume and low drag made it an obvious design for this role.  His deep-chord [[monoplane]] wing was incorporated in the otherwise conventional [[Junkers J 1]] in December 1915. In 1919 he started work on his \"Giant\" [[JG1]] design, intended to seat passengers within a thick wing, but two years later the Allied Aeronautical Commission of Control ordered the incomplete JG1 destroyed for exceeding postwar size limits on German aircraft.  Junkers conceived futuristic flying wings for up to 1,000 passengers; the nearest this came to realization was in the 1931 [[Junkers G.38]] 34-seater ''Grossflugzeug'' airliner, which featured a large thick-chord wing providing space for fuel, engines, and two passenger cabins.  However, it still required a short fuselage to house the crew and additional passengers.\n\nThe flying wing configuration was studied extensively from the 1920s, often in conjunction with other tailless designs.\n\nThe Soviet [[Boris Ivanovich Cheranovsky]] began testing tailless flying wing gliders in 1924 gliders, eventually producing the powered [[BICh-3]].\n\nAfter the 1920s, Soviet designers such as Boris Ivanovich Cheranovsky worked independently and in secret under Stalin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.century-of-flight.net/new%20site/frames/horten%20frame.htm |title=German flying wings |publisher=Century-of-flight.net|accessdate=2012-03-30}}</ref> With significant breakthrough in materials and construction methods, aircraft such as the [[Chyeranovskii BICh-3|BICh-3]],<ref>\"History of aircraft construction in the USSR\" by V.B.

The H1 glider was flown with partial success in 1933, and the subsequent H2 flown successfully in both glider and powered variants.<ref name=\"CADOHORTTOPSECRET\">{{cite web|title=Technical Report No. 76-45 on.

In 1942 Northrop flew the [[Northrop N-9M|N-9M]] scale development aircraft for a proposed long-range bomber. The German [[Horten Ho 229]] of March 1944 was the world's first twin jet engine pure flying wing, and pre-production examples were test-flown during the closing stages of the war.

Most famous example of these designs would be the [[Horten Ho 229]] fighter-bomber,  which first flew in 1944. It combined a flying wing, or ''Nurfl\u00fcgel'', design with twin jet engines in its second, or \"V2\" (V for ''Versuch'') prototype airframe flown by Erwin Ziller.

The work on the [[Northrop N-1M]] led to the [[Northrop YB-35|YB-35]] long-range bomber, with pre-production machines flying in 1946. This was superseded the next year by conversion of the type to jet power as the [[Northrop YB-49|YB-49]] of 1947.  The design did not necessarily offer a great advantage in range and presented a number of technical problems did not enter production. \n\nElsewhere, Turkey had been conducting research and the [[THK-13]] appeared in 1948.<ref>K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7,M. 2009.

[[Stealth technology]] relies on shapes that reflect only radar waves in certain directions, thus making the aircraft hard to detect unless the radar receiver is at a specific position relative to the aircraft\u2014a position that changes continuously as the aircraft moves.  This approach eventually led to the [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit]] [[Stealth aircraft|stealth]] bomber.  In this case, the aerodynamic advantages of the flying wing are not the primary reasons for the design's adoption.  However, modern computer-controlled [[fly-by-wire]] systems allow for many of the aerodynamic drawbacks of the flying wing to be minimized, making for an efficient and effectively stable long-range bomber.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nDue to the practical need for a deep wing, the flying wing concept is most practical for designs in the slow-to-medium speed range, and there has been continual interest in using it as a tactical [[airlift|airlifter]] design. [[Boeing]] continues to work on paper projects for a [[blended wing body]], [[C-130 Hercules]]-size transport with better range and about one third more load, while maintaining the same size characteristics. A number of companies, including [[Boeing]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[de Havilland]], did considerable design work on flying wing [[airliner]]s, but to date none has entered production.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Northrop N-1M Udvar-Hazy.jpg|thumb|A [[Northrop N-1M]] on display at the [[National Air and Space Museum]]'s [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]] ]]\n\nA clean flying wing is sometimes presented as theoretically the most [[aerodynamics|aerodynamically]] efficient (lowest drag) design configuration for a fixed wing aircraft. It also would offer high structural efficiency for a given wing depth, leading to light weight and high fuel efficiency.\n\nBecause it lacks conventional stabilizing surfaces and the associated control surfaces, in its purest form the flying wing suffers from the inherent disadvantages of being unstable and difficult to control. These compromises are difficult to reconcile, and efforts to do so can reduce or even negate the expected advantages of the flying wing design, such as reductions in weight and [[Drag (physics)|drag]]. Moreover, solutions may produce a final design that is still too unsafe for certain uses, such as commercial aviation.\n\nFurther difficulties arise from the problem of fitting the pilot, engines, flight equipment, and payload all within the depth of the wing section. \n\nOther known problems with the flying wing design relate to [[Flight dynamics|pitch]] and [[Flight dynamics|yaw]]. Pitch issues are discussed in the article on [[tailless aircraft]]. The problems of yaw are discussed below.\n\n===Engineering design===\nA wing that is made deep enough to contain the pilot, engines, fuel, undercarriage and other necessary equipment will have an increased frontal area, when compared with a conventional wing and long-thin fuselage. This can actually result in higher drag and thus lower efficiency than a conventional design. Typically the solution adopted in this case is to keep the wing reasonably thin, and the aircraft is then fitted with an assortment of blisters, pods, nacelles, fins, and so forth to accommodate all the needs of a practical aircraft.\n\nThe problem becomes more acute at supersonic speeds, where the drag of a thick wing rises sharply and it is essential for the wing to be made thin. No supersonic flying wing has ever been built.\n\n===Directional stability===\nFor any aircraft to fly without constant correction it must have [[directional stability]] in yaw.\n\nFlying wings lack anywhere to attach an efficient vertical stabilizer or fin. Any fin must attach directly on to the rear part of the wing, giving a small moment arm from the aerodynamic center, which in turn means that the fin is inefficient and to be effective the fin area must be large. Such a large fin has weight and drag penalties, and can negate the advantages of the flying wing. The problem can be minimized by increasing the wing sweepback and placing twin fins outboard near the tips, as for example in a low-aspect-ratio delta wing, but many flying wings have gentler sweepback and consequently have, at best, marginal stability.\n\nAnother solution is to angle or crank the wing tip sections downward with significant [[Dihedral (aircraft)#Anhedral|anhedral]], increasing the area at the rear of the aircraft when viewed from the side.\n\nYet another approach uses differential twist or wash out, together with a swept-back wing planform and a suitable airfoil section. Prandtl, Pankonin and others discovered this and it was fundamental to the yaw stability of the [[Horten brothers]] flying wings of the 1930s and 1940s. The Hortens described a \"bell shaped lift distribution\" across the span of the wing, with more lift in the center section and less at the tips due to their reduced angle of incidence, or washing out. This creates a slightly forward-pointing lift vector for the rear (outer) section of the wing. When displaced, this vector essentially \"pulls\" the trailing wing forward to re-align the aircraft along its flight path.<ref>Guiler, R.W.; Control of a swept wing tailless aircraft through wing morphing, ''ICAS 2008: 26th Congress of International Council of the Aeronautical Sciences, Paper ICAS 2008-2.7.1'', Pages 1\u20132.</ref>\n\n===Yaw control===\nIn some flying wing designs, any stabilizing fins and associated control rudders would be too far forward to have much effect, thus alternative means for [[Yaw (rotation)|yaw]] control are sometimes provided.\n\nOne solution to the control problem is differential drag: the drag near one wing tip is artificially increased, causing the aircraft to yaw in the direction of that wing. Typical methods include:\n* [[Deceleron|Split ailerons]]. The top surface moves up while the lower surface moves down. Splitting the aileron on one side induces yaw by creating a differential air brake effect.  \n* [[Spoiler (aeronautics)|Spoilers]]. A spoiler surface in the upper wing skin is raised, to disrupt the airflow and increase drag. This effect is generally accompanied by a loss of lift, which must be compensated for either by the pilot or by complex design features.\n* [[Spoileron]]s. An upper surface spoiler that also acts to reduce lift (equivalent to deflecting an aileron upwards), so causing the aircraft to bank in the direction of the turn\u2014the angle of roll causes the wing lift to act in the direction of turn, reducing the amount of drag required to turn the aircraft's longitudinal axis.\n\nA consequence of the differential drag method is that if the aircraft maneuvers frequently then it will frequently create drag. So flying wings are at their best when cruising in still air: in turbulent air or when changing course, the aircraft may be less efficient than a conventional design.\n\n==Bi-directional flying wing==\n[[File:Wing bi-directional.svg|thumb|150px|Bi-directional flying wing, top-down view]]\n\nThe supersonic bi-directional flying wing design comprises a long-span low speed wing and a short-span high speed wing joined in the form of an unequal cross.\n\nThe proposed craft would take off and land with the low-speed wing across the airflow, then rotate a quarter-turn so that the high-speed wing faces the airflow for supersonic travel.<ref>Zha, Im & Espinal, [http://www6.miami.edu/acfdlab/projects/AIAA2010-1013_slides_pdf.pdf Toward Zero Sonic-Boom and High Efficiency Supersonic Flight: A Novel Concept of Supersonic Bi-Directional Flying Wing]</ref> NASA has funded a study of the proposal.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/early_stage_innovation/niac/niac_2012_phaseIandII_awards.html NIAC 2012 Phase I & Phase II Awards Announcement]</ref>\n\nThe design is claimed to feature low wave drag, high subsonic efficiency and little or no sonic boom.\n\nThe proposed low-speed wing would have a thick, rounded airfoil able to contain the payload and a long span for high efficiency, while the high-speed wing would have a thin, sharp-edged airfoil and a shorter span for low drag at supersonic speed.\n\n==Related designs==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2011}}\nSome related aircraft that are not strictly flying wings have been described as such.\n\nSome types, such as the [[Northrop X-216H|Northrop Flying Wing (NX-216H)]], still have a tail stabilizer mounted on tail booms, although they lack a fuselage.\n\nMany hang gliders and microlight aircraft are tailless.  Although sometimes referred to as flying wings, these types carry the pilot (and engine where fitted) below the wing structure rather than inside it, and so are not true flying wings.\n\nAn aircraft of sharply swept delta planform and deep center section represents a borderline case between flying wing, [[blended wing body]], and/or [[lifting body]] configurations.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of flying wings]]\n* [[Delta wing]]\n* [[Lifting body]]\n* [[Oblique wing]]\n* [[Vincent Burnelli]]\n* ''[[Zanonia macrocarpa]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Gunston |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill Gunston|year=1996 |title=Beyond the Frontiers: Northrop's Flying Wings |journal=Wings of Fame |publisher=Aerospace Publishing|location=London |issue=Volume 2 |pages=24\u201337|isbn=1-874023-69-7|issn=1361-2034}}\n* Kohn, Leo J.
