The concept is employed in work on [[artificial intelligence]]. The expression was introduced by [[Gerardo Beni]] and Jing Wang in 1989, in the context of cellular robotic systems.<ref>Beni, G., Wang, J. Swarm Intelligence in Cellular Robotic Systems, Proceed. NATO Advanced Workshop on Robots and Biological Systems, Tuscany, Italy, June 26\u201330 (1989)</ref>\n\nSI systems consist typically of a population of simple [[Intelligent agent|agents]] or [[boids]] interacting locally with one another and with their environment. The inspiration often comes from nature, especially biological systems. The agents follow very simple rules, and although there is no centralized control structure dictating how individual agents should behave, local, and to a certain degree random, interactions between such agents lead to the [[emergence]] of \"intelligent\" global behavior, unknown to the individual agents.   Examples in natural systems of SI include [[Ant colony|ant colonies]], bird [[Flocking (behavior)|flocking]], animal [[herding]], [[Bacteria#Growth and reproduction|bacterial growth]], fish [[Shoaling and schooling|schooling]] and [[microbial intelligence]].\n\nThe application of swarm principles to [[robot]]s is called [[swarm robotics]], while 'swarm intelligence' refers to the more general set of algorithms. 'Swarm prediction' has been used in the context of forecasting problems.\n\n== Models of swarm behavior ==\n{{see also|Swarm behaviour}}\n=== Boids (Reynolds 1987) ===\n{{main|Boids}}\nBoids is an [[artificial life]] program, developed by [[Craig Reynolds (computer graphics)|Craig Reynolds]] in 1986, which simulates the [[Flocking (behavior)|flocking]] behaviour of birds.

Each agent maintains a hypothesis which is iteratively tested by evaluating a randomly selected partial objective function parameterised by the agent's current hypothesis. In the standard version of SDS such partial function evaluations are binary, resulting in each agent becoming active or inactive. Information on hypotheses is diffused across the population via inter-agent communication. Unlike the [[Stigmergy|stigmergic]] communication used in ACO, in SDS agents communicate [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] via a one-to-one communication strategy analogous to the [[tandem running]] procedure observed in [[Leptothorax acervorum]].<ref>Moglich, M.; Maschwitz, U.; Holldobler, B., Tandem Calling: A New Kind of Signal in Ant Communication, Science, Volume 186, Issue 4168, pp. 1046-1047</ref> A positive feedback mechanism ensures that, over time, a population of agents stabilise around the global-best solution.

ACO is a [[Probabilistic algorithm|probabilistic technique]] useful in problems that deal with finding better paths through graphs. Artificial 'ants'\u2014simulation agents\u2014locate optimal solutions by moving through a [[parameter space]] representing all possible solutions. Natural ants lay down [[pheromone]]s directing each other to resources while exploring their environment. The simulated 'ants' similarly record their positions and the quality of their solutions, so that in later simulation iterations more ants locate better solutions.<ref>Ant Colony Optimization by Marco Dorigo and Thomas St\u00fctzle, MIT Press, 2004. ISBN 0-262-04219-3</ref>\n\n=== Particle swarm optimization (Kennedy, Eberhart & Shi 1995) ===\n{{main|Particle swarm optimization}}\nParticle swarm optimization (PSO) is a [[global optimization]] algorithm for dealing with problems in which a best solution can be represented as a point or surface in an n-dimensional space.  Hypotheses are plotted in this space and seeded with an initial [[velocity]], as well as a communication channel between the particles.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1016568309421 |title=Recent Approaches to Global Optimization Problems Through Particle Swarm Optimization |last=Parsopoulos |first=K.

Over time, particles are accelerated towards those particles within their communication grouping which have better fitness values. The main advantage of such an approach over other global minimization strategies such as [[simulated annealing]] is that the large number of members that make up the particle swarm make the technique impressively resilient to the problem of [[local minima]].\n\n==Applications==\nSwarm Intelligence-based techniques can be used in a number of applications.  The U.S. military is investigating swarm techniques for controlling unmanned vehicles. The [[European Space Agency]] is thinking about an orbital swarm for self-assembly and interferometry. [[NASA]] is investigating the use of swarm technology for planetary mapping.  A 1992 paper by [[M. Anthony Lewis (roboticist)|M. Anthony Lewis]] and [[George A. Bekey]] discusses the possibility of using swarm intelligence to control nanobots within the body for the purpose of killing cancer tumors.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lewis |first=M.

This was pioneered separately by Dorigo et al. and [[Hewlett Packard]] in the mid-1990s, with a number of variations since. Basically this uses a [[Probabilistic algorithm|probabilistic]] routing table rewarding/reinforcing the route successfully traversed by each \"ant\" (a small control packet) which flood the network. Reinforcement of the route in the forwards, reverse direction and both simultaneously have been researched: backwards reinforcement requires a symmetric network and couples the two directions together; forwards reinforcement rewards a route before the outcome is known (but then you pay for the cinema before you know how good the film is). As the system behaves stochastically and is therefore lacking repeatability, there are large hurdles to commercial deployment. Mobile media and new technologies have the potential to change the threshold for collective action due to swarm intelligence (Rheingold: 2002, P175).\n\nThe location of transmission infrastructure for wireless communication networks is an important engineering problem involving competing objectives. A minimal selection of locations (or sites) are required subject to providing adequate area coverage for users. A very different-ant inspired swarm intelligence algorithm, [[stochastic diffusion search]] (SDS), has been successfully used to provide a general model for this problem, related to circle packing and set covering. It has been shown that the SDS can be applied to identify suitable solutions even for large problem instances.<ref>Whitaker, R.M., Hurley, S.. An agent based approach to site selection for wireless networks. Proc ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, pp. 574\u2013577, (2002).</ref>\n\nAirlines have also used ant-based routing in assigning aircraft arrivals to airport gates. At [[Southwest Airlines]] a software program uses swarm theory, or swarm intelligence\u2014the idea that a colony of ants works better than one alone. Each pilot acts like an ant searching for the best airport gate. \"The pilot learns from his experience what's the best for him, and it turns out that that's the best solution for the airline,\" [[Douglas A. Lawson]] explains. As a result, the \"colony\" of pilots always go to gates they can arrive at and depart from quickly. The program can even alert a pilot of plane back-ups before they happen. \"We can anticipate that it's going to happen, so we'll have a gate available,\" Lawson says.<ref>{{cite news |work=Science Daily |date=April 1, 2008 |title=Planes, Trains and Ant Hills: Computer scientists simulate activity of ants to reduce airline delays |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/videos/2008/0406-planes_trains_and_ant_hills.htm |accessdate=December 1, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Crowd simulation===\nArtists are using swarm technology as a means of creating complex interactive systems or [[Crowd simulation|simulating crowds]].\n\n[[Stanley and Stella in: Breaking the Ice]] was the first movie to make use of swarm technology for rendering, realistically depicting the movements of groups of fish and birds using the [[Boids]] system. Tim Burton's ''[[Batman Returns]]'' also made use of swarm technology for showing the movements of a group of bats. [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]] made use of similar technology, known as [[Massive (software)|Massive]], during battle scenes. Swarm technology is particularly attractive because it is cheap, robust, and simple.\n\nAirlines have used swarm theory to simulate passengers boarding a plane. Southwest Airlines researcher [[Douglas A. Lawson]] used an ant-based computer simulation employing only six interaction rules to evaluate boarding times using various boarding methods.(Miller, 2010, xii-xviii).<ref>{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Peter |year=2010 |title=The Smart Swarm: How understanding flocks, schools, and colonies can make us better at communicating, decision making, and getting things done |publisher=Avery |location=New York |isbn=978-1-58333-390-7 }}</ref>\n\n===Human swarming===\nEnabled by mediating software such as the UNU collective intelligence platform, networks of distributed users can be organized into \"human swarms\" (also referred to as \"social swarms\") through the implementation of real-time closed-loop control systems. As published by [[Louis B. Rosenberg|Rosenberg]] (2015), such real-time control systems enable groups of human participants to behave as a unified [[collective intelligence]].<ref>http://sites.lsa.umich.edu/collectiveintelligence/wp-content/uploads/sites/176/2015/05/Rosenberg-CI-2015-Abstract.pdf</ref> When logged into the UNU platform, for example, groups of distributed users can collectively answer questions, generate ideas, and make predictions as a singular emergent entity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/ecal2015/ch117.html|title=Human Swarms, a real-time method for collective intelligence|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/human/life/swarms-of-humans-power-a-i-platform-150603.htm|title=Swarms of Humans Power A.I.
