The PSTN consists of [[telephone line]]s, [[fiber optic cable]]s, [[microwave transmission]] links, [[cellular network]]s, [[communications satellite]]s, and [[Undersea cable|undersea telephone cables]], all interconnected by [[switching center]]s, thus allowing most telephones to communicate with each other.  Originally a network of fixed-line [[analog signal|analog]] telephone systems, the PSTN is now almost entirely [[Digital data|digital]] in its [[core network]] and includes [[mobile phone|mobile]] and other networks, as well as [[landline#Fixed phone|fixed]] telephones.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruce-kushnick/public-switched-telephone-networks_b_2377773.html | title=What Are the Public Switched Telephone Networks, 'PSTN' and Why You Should Care? | publisher=Huffington Post Blog | date=7 January 2013 | accessdate=11 April 2014 | author=Kushnick, Bruce}}</ref>\n\nThe technical operation of the PSTN adheres to the standards created by the [[ITU-T]]. These standards allow different networks in different countries to  [[interconnection|interconnect]] seamlessly. The [[E.163]] and [[E.164]] standards provide a single global [[address space]] for telephone numbers. The combination of the interconnected networks and the single [[numbering plan]] allow telephones around the world to dial each other.\n\n==History (USA)==\n\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe first telephones had no network but were in private use, wired together in pairs{{when?|date=July 2014}}. Users who wanted to talk to different people had as many telephones as necessary for the purpose. A user who wished to speak whistled loudly into the transmitter until the other party heard.\n\nHowever, a bell was added soon for signaling, so an attendant no longer need wait for the whistle, and then a [[Telephone hook|switch hook]]. Later telephones took advantage of the exchange principle already employed in telegraph networks. Each telephone was wired to a local [[telephone exchange]], and the exchanges were wired together with [[trunking|trunks]]. Networks were connected in a hierarchical manner until they spanned cities, countries, continents and oceans. This was the beginning of the PSTN{{when?|date=July 2014}}, though the term was not used for many decades.\n\nAutomation introduced [[pulse dial]]ing between the phone and the exchange, and then among exchanges, followed by more sophisticated address signaling including [[multi-frequency]], culminating in the [[Signaling System 7|SS7]] network that connected most exchanges by the end of the 20th century.\n\nThe growth of the PSTN meant that [[teletraffic engineering]] techniques needed to be deployed to deliver [[quality of service]] (QoS) guarantees for the users.  The work of [[Agner Krarup Erlang|A. K. Erlang]] established the mathematical foundations of methods required to determine the capacity requirements and configuration of equipment and the number of personnel required to deliver a specific level of service.\n\nIn the 1970s the telecommunications industry began implementing [[packet switched network]] data services using the [[X.25]] protocol transported over much of the end-to-end equipment as was already in use in the PSTN.\n\nIn the 1980s the industry began planning for digital services assuming they would follow much the same pattern as voice services, and conceived a vision of end-to-end circuit switched services, known as the [[Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network]] (B-ISDN). The B-ISDN vision has been overtaken by the [[disruptive technology]] of the Internet.\n\nAt the turn of the 21st century, the oldest parts of the telephone network still use analog technology for the [[last mile]] [[local loop|loop]] to the end user. However, digital technologies such as [[Digital Subscriber Line|DSL]], [[ISDN]], [[Fiber to the x|FTTx]], and [[cable modems]] have become more common in this portion of the network.\n\nSeveral large private telephone networks are not linked to the PSTN, usually for military purposes. There are also private networks run by large companies which are linked to the PSTN only through limited [[Gateway (telecommunications)|gateways]], such as a large [[private branch exchange]] (PBX).\n\n== Operators ==\nThe task of building the networks and selling services to customers fell to the [[telephone company|network operators]]. The first company to be incorporated to provide PSTN services was the  [[Bell Telephone Company]] in the United States.\n\nIn some countries, however, the job of providing telephone networks fell to government as the investment required was very large and the provision of telephone service was increasingly becoming an essential [[public utility]]. For example, the  [[General Post Office]] in the United Kingdom brought together a number of private companies to form a single [[state ownership|nationalized company]]. In recent decades however, these state monopolies were broken up or sold off through [[privatization]].{{clarify|date=April 2014}}{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n== Regulation ==\nIn most countries, the central has a [[regulatory agency|regulator]] dedicated to monitoring the provision of PSTN services in that country.  Their tasks may be for example to ensure that end customers are not over-charged for services where monopolies may exist.  They may also regulate the prices charged between the operators to [[interconnection|carry each other's traffic]].\n\n==Technology==\n=== Network topology ===\n{{main|PSTN network topology}}\nThe PSTN network architecture had to evolve over the years to support increasing numbers of subscribers, calls, connections to other countries, direct dialing and so on. The model developed by the United States and Canada was adopted by other nations, with adaptations for local markets.\n\nThe original concept was that the [[telephone exchange]]s are arranged into hierarchies, so that if a call cannot be handled in a local cluster, it is passed to one higher up for onward routing. This reduced the number of connecting trunks required between operators over long distances and also kept local traffic separate.\n\nHowever, in modern networks the cost of transmission and equipment is lower and, although hierarchies still exist, they are much flatter, with perhaps only two layers.\n\n===Digital channels===\n{{Main|Telephone exchange}}\nAs described above, most automated [[telephone exchange]]s now use digital switching rather than mechanical or analog switching. The  [[circuit switched|trunks]] connecting the exchanges are also digital, called circuits or channels. However analog  [[two-wire circuit]]s are still used to connect the [[last mile]] from the exchange to the telephone in the home (also called the [[local loop]]). To carry a typical phone call from a  [[calling party]] to a [[called party]], the analog audio signal is digitized at an 8&nbsp;kHz [[sample rate]] with 8-bit resolution using a special type of nonlinear [[pulse code modulation]] known as [[G.711]]. The call is then transmitted from one end to another via telephone exchanges. The call is switched using a call set up protocol (usually [[ISDN User Part|ISUP]]) between the telephone exchanges under an overall [[routing in the PSTN|routing strategy]].\n\nThe call is carried over the PSTN using a 64 [[kbit/s]] channel, originally designed by [[Bell Labs]].  The name given to this channel is [[Digital Signal 0]] (DS0).  The DS0 circuit is the basic granularity of [[circuit switching]] in a telephone exchange. A DS0 is also known as a [[timeslot]] because DS0s are aggregated in [[time-division multiplexing]] (TDM) equipment to form higher capacity communication links.\n\nA [[Digital Signal 1]] (DS1) circuit carries 24 DS0s on a North American or Japanese [[T-carrier]] (T1) line, or 32 DS0s (30 for calls plus two for framing and signaling) on an [[E-carrier]] (E1) line used in most other countries. In modern networks, the multiplexing function is moved as close to the end user as possible, usually into cabinets at the roadside in residential areas, or into large business premises.\n\nThese aggregated circuits are conveyed from the initial multiplexer to the exchange over a set of equipment collectively known as the [[access network]]. The access network and inter-exchange transport use [[synchronization|synchronous]] optical transmission, for example, [[SONET]] and [[Synchronous Digital Hierarchy]] (SDH) technologies, although some parts still use the older [[Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy|PDH]] technology.\n\nWithin the access network, there are a number of reference points defined. Most of these are of interest mainly to [[ISDN]] but one \u2013 the [[V reference point]] \u2013 is of more general interest. This is the reference point between a primary multiplexer and an exchange. The protocols at this reference point were standardized in [[ETSI]] areas as the [[V5 interface]].\n\n===Impact on IP standards===\nVoice quality over PSTN networks was used as the benchmark for the development of the [[Telecommunications Industry Association]]'s TIA-TSB-116 standard on voice-quality recommendations for IP telephony, to determine acceptable levels of audio delay and echo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://global.ihs.com/doc_detail.cfm?item_s_key=00381377 |title=TIA TSB-116 |publisher=Global.ihs.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Internet area network]] (IAN)\n* [[Managed facilities-based voice network]]\n* [[Plain old telephone service]] (POTS)\n* [[PSTN network topology]]\n* [[Via Net Loss]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Telephony}}\n{{Telecommunications}}\n\n[[Category:Telecommunications systems]]\n[[Category:Telephony]]\n[[Category:Public sphere|Switched telephone network]]"}]}}}}
