Ions can be created, by either chemical or physical means, via [[ionization]].\n\nIn chemical terms, if a neutral atom loses one or more electrons, it has a net positive charge and is known as a [[Ion#Anions and cations|cation]].\n\nIf an atom gains electrons, it has a net negative charge and is known as an [[Ion#Anions and cations|anion]].\n\nIons consisting of only a single atom are atomic or [[monatomic ion]]s; if they consist of two or more atoms, they are [[molecular]] or [[polyatomic ion]]s. Because of their electric charges, cations and anions attract each other and readily form [[ionic compound]]s, such as [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s.\n\nIn the case of physical ionization of a medium, such as a gas, what are known as \"ion pairs\" are created by ion impact, and each pair consists of a free electron and a positive ion.<ref name = \"knoll\"/>\n\n== History of discovery ==\n\nThe word ''ion'' is the Greek \u1f30\u03cc\u03bd, ''ion'', \"going\", the present participle of \u1f30\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9, ''ienai'', \"to go\". This term was introduced by English physicist and chemist [[Michael Faraday]] in 1834 for the then-unknown species that ''goes'' from one [[electrode]] to the other through an aqueous medium.<ref>{{cite video | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/faraday_michael.shtml | title=Michael Faraday (1791-1867) | publisher=BBC | location=UK}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=ion | title=Online etymology dictionary | accessdate=2011-01-07}}</ref> Faraday did not know the nature of these species, but he knew that since metals dissolved into and entered a solution at one electrode, and new metal came forth from a solution at the other electrode, that some kind of substance moved through the solution in a current, conveying matter from one place to the other.\n\nFaraday also introduced the words ''anion'' for a negatively charged ion, and ''cation'' for a positively charged one. In Faraday's nomenclature, cations were named because they were attracted to the [[cathode]] in a galvanic device and anions were named due to their attraction to the [[anode]].\n\nSvante Arrhenius put forth, in his 1884 dissertation, his explanation of the fact that solid crystalline salts disassociate into paired charged particles when dissolved, for which he would win the 1903 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.<ref>http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1903/index.html</ref> Arrhenius' explanation was that in forming a solution, the salt dissociates into Faraday's ions. Arrhenius proposed that ions formed even in the absence of an electric current.<ref name=\"columbia\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Harris|editor1-first=William|editor2-last=Levey|editor2-first=Judith|title=The New Columbia Encyclopedia|date=1975|publisher=Columbia University|location=New York City|isbn=0-231035-721|page=155|edition=4th}}</ref><ref  name=\"EncBrit\">{{cite book|editor1-last=McHenry|editor1-first=Charles|title=The New Encyclopedia Britannica|date=1992|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica, Inc.|location=Chicago|isbn=085-229553-7|page=587|volume=1|edition=15}}</ref><ref name=\"SciBio\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Cillispie|editor1-first=Charles|title=Dictionary of Scientific Biography|date=1970|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York City|isbn=0-684101-122|pages=296\u2013302|edition=1}}</ref>\n\n== Characteristics ==\nIons in their gas-like state are highly reactive, and do not occur in large amounts on Earth, except in flames, lightning, electrical sparks, and other [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]s.\n\nThese gas-like ions rapidly interact with ions of opposite charge to give neutral molecules or ionic salts. Ions are also produced in the liquid or solid state when salts interact with solvents (for example, water) to produce \"solvated ions,\" which are more stable, for reasons involving a combination of [[energy]] and [[entropy]] changes as the ions move away from each other to interact with the liquid.  These stabilized species are more commonly found in the environment at low temperatures. A common example is the ions present in seawater, which are derived from the dissolved salts.\n\nAll ions are charged, which means that like all charged objects they are:\n* attracted to opposite electric charges (positive to negative, and vice versa),\n* repelled by like charges\n* when moving, travel in trajectories that are deflected by a [[magnetic field]].\n\nElectrons, due to their smaller mass and thus larger space-filling properties as [[matter waves]], determine the size of atoms and molecules that possess any electrons at all. Thus, anions (negatively charged ions) are larger than the parent molecule or atom, as the excess electron(s) repel each other, and add to the physical size of the ion, because its size is determined by its [[electron cloud]]. As such, in general, cations are smaller than the corresponding parent atom or molecule due to the smaller size of its electron cloud. One particular cation (that of hydrogen) contains no electrons, and thus consists of a single proton - ''very much smaller'' than the parent hydrogen atom.\n\n=== Anions and cations===\n[[File:Ions.svg|thumb|upright=1.75|[[Hydrogen atom]] (centre) contains a single [[proton]] and a single [[electron]].  Removal of the electron gives a cation (left), whereas addition of an electron gives an anion (right).  The hydrogen anion, with its loosely held two-electron cloud, has a larger radius than the neutral atom, which in turn is much larger than the bare proton of the [[cation]]. Hydrogen forms the only cation that has no electrons, but even cations that (unlike hydrogen) still retain one or more electrons are still smaller than the neutral atoms or molecules from which they are derived.]]\n{{redirect2|Cation|Anion|the particle physics/quantum computing concept|Anyon|other uses|Ion (disambiguation)}}\nSince the electric charge on a proton is equal in magnitude to the charge on an electron, the net electric charge on an ion is equal to the number of protons in the ion minus the number of electrons.\n\nAn ''anion'' (\u2212) ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u00e6|n|.|a\u026a|.|\u0259n}} {{respell|AN|eye-\u0259n}}), from the Greek word \u1f04\u03bd\u03c9 (''\u00e1n\u014d''), meaning \"up\",<ref>{{cite web | doi=10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095414154 | title =Oxford Reference: OVERVIEW anion | author =''[[Oxford University Press]]'' | publisher =oxfordreference.com | date =2013| doi_brokendate =2015-01-01 }}</ref> is an ion with more electrons than protons, giving it a net negative charge (since electrons are negatively charged and protons are positively charged).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ruby.colorado.edu/~smyth/G101-2.html | title =Atoms and Elements, Isotopes and Ions | author =''[[University of Colorado Boulder]]'' | publisher =colorado.edu | date =November 21, 2013}}</ref>\n\nA ''cation'' (+) ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|\u00e6|t|.|a\u026a|.|\u0259n}} {{respell|KAT|eye-\u0259n}}), from the Greek word \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac (''kat\u00e1''), meaning \"down\",<ref>{{cite web | doi=10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095555447 | title =Oxford Reference: OVERVIEW cation | author =''[[Oxford University Press]]'' | publisher =oxfordreference.com | date =2013| doi_brokendate=2015-01-01 }}</ref> is an ion with fewer electrons than protons, giving it a positive charge.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.usouthal.edu/geology/haywick/GY111/111-4.pdf | title =Elemental Chemistry | author =Douglas W.

Atoms in their ionic state may have a different colour from neutral atoms, and thus light absorption by metal ions gives the colour of [[gemstone]]s. In both inorganic and organic chemistry (including biochemistry), the interaction of water and ions is extremely important; an example is the energy that drives breakdown of adenosine triphosphate ([[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]). The following sections describe contexts in which ions feature prominently; these are arranged in decreasing physical length-scale, from the astronomical to the microscopic.\n\n==== Astronomical ====\n\nA collection of non-aqueous gas-like ions, or even a gas containing a proportion of charged particles, is called a plasma.  Greater than 99.9% of visible matter in the Universe may be in the form of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]s.<ref>[http://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/ast07sep99_1.htm Plasma, Plasma, Everywhere] Science@NASA Headline news, Space Science n\u00b0 158, September 7, 1999.</ref>  These include our [[Sun]] and other [[stars]] and the [[interplanetary medium|space between planets]], as well as the [[interstellar medium|space in between stars]].  Plasmas are often called the ''fourth state of matter'' because their properties are substantially different from those of [[solid]]s, [[liquid]]s, and [[gas]]es. [[Astrophysical plasmas]] predominantly contain a mixture of electrons and protons (ionized hydrogen).\n\n== Related technology ==\nIons can be non-chemically prepared using various [[ion source]]s, usually involving high [[voltage]] or temperature.  These are used in a multitude of devices such as [[Mass spectrometry|mass spectrometers]], [[optical emission spectrometer]]s, [[particle accelerators]], [[Ion implantation|ion implanters]], and [[Ion thruster|ion engines]].\n\nAs reactive charged particles, they are also used in [[Air ioniser|air purification]] by disrupting microbes, and in household items such as [[smoke detector]]s.\n\nAs signalling and metabolism in organisms are controlled by a precise ionic gradient across [[cell membrane|membrane]]s, the disruption of this gradient contributes to cell death.  This is a common mechanism exploited by natural and artificial [[biocides]], including the [[ion channels]] [[gramicidin]] and [[amphotericin]] (a [[fungicide]]).\n\nInorganic dissolved ions are a component of [[total dissolved solids]], an indicator of [[water quality]] in the world.\n\n===Detection of ionizing radiation===\n[[File:Ion chamber operation.gif|thumb|right|300px|Schematic of an ion chamber, showing drift of ions. Electrons drift faster than positive ions due to their much smaller mass.<ref name = \"knoll\"/>]]\n[[File:Electron avalanche.gif|thumbnail|300px|Avalanche effect between two electrodes. The original ionization event liberates one electron, and each subsequent collision liberates a further electron, so two electrons emerge from each collision: the ionizing electron and the liberated electron.]]\nThe ionizing effect of radiation on a gas is extensively used for the detection of radiation such as [[alpha particle|alpha]], [[beta particle|beta]], [[gamma ray|gamma]] and [[X-rays]]. The original ionization event in these instruments results in the formation of an \"ion pair\"; a positive ion and a free electron, by ion impact by the radiation on the gas molecules. The [[ionization chamber]] is the simplest of these detectors, and collects all the charges created by ''direct ionization'' within the gas through the application of an electric field.<ref name = \"knoll\">{{cite book |first=Glenn F |last=Knoll |title=Radiation detection and measurement |edition=3rd |date=1999 |location=New York |publisher=Wiley |isbn=0-471-07338-5}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Geiger\u2013M\u00fcller tube]] and the [[proportional counter]] both use a phenomenon known as a [[Townsend avalanche]] to multiply the effect of the original ionizing event by means of a cascade effect whereby the free electrons are given sufficient energy by the electric field to release further electrons by ion impact.\n\n==Chemistry==\n\n=== Notation ===\n\n====Denoting the charged state====\n[[File:Ions notation.svg|thumb|right|Equivalent notations for an [[iron]] atom (Fe) that lost two electrons, referred to as [[ferrous]].]]\n\nWhen writing the [[chemical formula]] for an ion, its net charge is written in superscript immediately after the chemical structure for the molecule/atom.  The net charge is written with the magnitude ''before'' the sign; that is, a doubly charged cation is indicated as '''2+''' instead of '''+2'''.   However, the magnitude of the charge is omitted for singly charged molecules/atoms; for example, the [[sodium]] cation is indicated as Na<sup>+</sup> and ''not'' Na<sup>1+</sup>.\n\nAn alternative (and acceptable) way of showing a molecule/atom with multiple charges is by drawing out the signs multiple times; this is often seen with transition metals.  Chemists sometimes circle the sign; this is merely ornamental and does not alter the chemical meaning.  All three representations of {{chem|Fe|2+}} shown in the figure are, thus, equivalent.\n\n[[File:Ions notation2.svg|thumb|Mixed Roman numerals and charge notations for the uranyl ion. The oxidation state of the metal is shown as superscripted Roman numerals, whereas the charge of the entire complex is shown by the angle symbol together with the magnitude and sign of the net charge.]]\n\nMonatomic ions are sometimes also denoted with Roman numerals; for example, the {{chem|Fe|2+}} example seen above is occasionally referred to as Fe(II) or Fe<sup>II</sup>.  The Roman numeral designates the ''formal [[oxidation state]]'' of an element, whereas the superscripted numerals denote the net charge.  The two notations are, therefore, exchangeable for monatomic ions, but the Roman numerals ''cannot'' be applied to polyatomic ions.  However, it is possible to mix the notations for the individual metal centre with a polyatomic complex, as shown by the uranyl ion example.\n\n====Sub-classes====\nIf an ion contains [[unpaired electron]]s, it is called a ''[[radical (chemistry)|radical]]'' ion. Just like uncharged radicals, radical ions are very reactive.  Polyatomic ions containing oxygen, such as carbonate and sulfate, are called ''[[oxyanion]]s''.   Molecular ions that contain at least one carbon to hydrogen bond are called ''organic ions''.  If the charge in an organic ion is formally centred on a carbon, it is termed a ''[[carbocation]]'' (if positively charged) or ''[[carbanion]]'' (if negatively charged).\n\n=== Formation ===\n\n==== Formation of monatomic ions ====\nMonatomic ions are formed by the gain or loss of electrons to the [[Valence electron|valence shell]] (the outer-most electron shell) in an atom. The inner shells of an atom are filled with electrons that are tightly bound to the positively charged [[atomic nucleus]], and so do not participate in this kind of chemical interaction. The process of gaining or losing electrons from a neutral atom or molecule is called ''ionization''.\n\nAtoms can be ionized by bombardment with [[radiation]], but the more usual process of ionization encountered in [[chemistry]] is the transfer of electrons between atoms or molecules. This transfer is usually driven by the attaining of stable (\"closed shell\") electronic configurations. Atoms will gain or lose electrons depending on which action takes the least energy.\n\nFor example, a [[sodium]] atom, Na, has a single electron in its valence shell, surrounding 2 stable, filled inner shells of 2 and 8 electrons. Since these filled shells are very stable, a sodium atom tends to lose its extra electron and attain this stable configuration, becoming a sodium cation in the process\n\n:Na \u2192 {{chem|Na|+}} + {{Subatomic particle|electron}}\n\nOn the other hand, a [[chlorine]] atom, Cl, has 7 electrons in its valence shell, which is one short of the stable, filled shell with 8 electrons. Thus, a chlorine atom tends to ''gain'' an extra electron and attain a stable 8-electron configuration, becoming a chloride anion in the process:\n\n:Cl + {{Subatomic particle|electron}} \u2192 {{chem|Cl|-}}\n\nThis driving force is what causes sodium and chlorine to undergo a chemical reaction, wherein the \"extra\" electron is transferred from sodium to chlorine, forming sodium cations and chloride anions. Being oppositely charged, these cations and anions form [[ionic bond]]s and combine to form [[sodium chloride]], NaCl, more commonly known as table salt.\n\n:{{chem|Na|+}} + {{chem|Cl|-}} \u2192 NaCl\n\n==== Formation of polyatomic and molecular ions ====\n[[File:Nitrate-ion-elpot.png|thumb|right|An [[electric potential|electrostatic potential]] map of the [[nitrate ion]] (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>). The 3-dimensional shell represents a single arbitrary [[isopotential]].]]\n\nPolyatomic and molecular ions are often formed by the gaining or losing of elemental ions such as a proton, H<sup>+</sup>, in neutral molecules. For example, when [[ammonia]], NH<sub>3</sub>, accepts a proton, H<sup>+</sup>\u2014a process called [[protonation]]\u2014it forms the [[ammonium]] ion, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>. Ammonia and ammonium have the same number of electrons in essentially the same [[electron configuration|electronic configuration]], but ammonium has an extra proton that gives it a net positive charge.\n\nAmmonia can also lose an electron to gain a positive charge, forming the ion {{chem|'''\u00b7'''NH|3|+}}. However, this ion is unstable, because it has an incomplete [[Valence electron|valence shell]] around the nitrogen atom, making it a very reactive [[radical (chemistry)|radical]] ion.\n\nDue to the instability of radical ions, polyatomic and molecular ions are usually formed by gaining or losing elemental ions such as {{chem|H|+}}, rather than gaining or losing electrons. This allows the molecule to preserve its stable electronic configuration while acquiring an electrical charge.\n\n==== Ionization potential ====\n{{main article|Ionization potential}}\nThe [[energy]] required to detach an electron in its lowest energy state from an atom or molecule of a gas with less net electric charge is called the ''ionization potential'', or ''ionization energy''. The ''n''th ionization energy of an atom is the energy required to detach its ''n''th electron after the first ''n \u2212 1'' electrons have already been detached.\n\nEach successive ionization energy is markedly greater than the last. Particularly great increases occur after any given block of [[atomic orbital]]s is exhausted of electrons. For this reason, ions tend to form in ways that leave them with full orbital blocks. For example, sodium has one ''[[valence electron]]'' in its outermost shell, so in ionized form it is commonly found with one lost electron, as {{chem|Na|+}}. On the other side of the periodic table, chlorine has seven valence electrons, so in ionized form it is commonly found with one gained electron, as {{chem|Cl|-}}. Caesium has the lowest measured ionization energy of all the elements and helium has the greatest.<ref name=\"lenntech.com\">[http://www.lenntech.com/Periodic-chart-elements/ionization-energy.htm Chemical elements listed by ionization energy]. Lenntech.com</ref> In general, the ionization energy of [[metals]] is much lower than the ionization energy of [[nonmetals]], which is why, in general, metals will lose electrons to form positively charged ions and nonmetals will gain electrons to form negatively charged ions.\n\n===Ionic bonding===\n{{main article|Ionic bond}}\n\n''Ionic bonding'' is a kind of [[chemical bond]]ing that arises from the mutual attraction of oppositely charged ions. Ions of like charge repel each other, and ions of opposite charge attract each other. Therefore, ions do not usually exist on their own, but will bind with ions of opposite charge to form a [[crystal lattice]]. The resulting compound is called an ''ionic compound'', and is said to be held together by ''ionic bonding''. In ionic compounds there arise characteristic distances between ion neighbours from which the spatial extension and the [[ionic radius]] of individual ions may be derived.\n\nThe most common type of ionic bonding is seen in compounds of metals and nonmetals (except [[noble gas]]es, which rarely form chemical compounds). Metals are characterized by having a small number of electrons in excess of a stable, closed-shell electronic configuration. As such, they have the tendency to lose these extra electrons in order to attain a stable configuration. This property is known as ''[[electropositivity]]''. Non-metals, on the other hand, are characterized by having an electron configuration just a few electrons short of a stable configuration. As such, they have the tendency to gain more electrons in order to achieve a stable configuration. This tendency is known as ''[[electronegativity]]''. When a highly electropositive metal is combined with a highly electronegative nonmetal, the extra electrons from the metal atoms are transferred to the electron-deficient nonmetal atoms. This reaction produces metal cations and nonmetal anions, which are attracted to each other to form a ''[[salt (chemistry)|salt]]''.\n\n===Common ions===\n{|\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Common cations\n|-\n!style=\"text-align: left\"|Common name\n!style=\"text-align: left\"|Formula\n!style=\"text-align: left\"|Historic name\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:aliceblue;\"|''Simple cations''\n|-\n|[[Aluminium]]||Al<sup>3+</sup>||\n|-\n|[[Barium]]||Ba<sup>2+</sup>||\n|-\n|[[Beryllium]]||Be<sup>2+</sup>||\n|-\n|[[Calcium]]||Ca<sup>2+</sup>||\n|-\n|Chromium(III)||Cr<sup>3+</sup>||\n|-\n|Copper(I)||Cu<sup>+</sup>||cuprous\n|-\n|Copper(II)||Cu<sup>2+</sup>||cupric\n|-\n|[[Hydrogen]]||H<sup>+</sup>||\n|-\n|Iron(II)||Fe<sup>2+</sup>||ferrous\n|-\n|Iron(III)||Fe<sup>3+</sup>||ferric\n|-\n|Lead(II)||Pb<sup>2+</sup>||plumbous\n|-\n|Lead(IV)||Pb<sup>4+</sup>||plumbic\n|-\n|[[Lithium]]||Li<sup>+</sup>||\n|-\n|[[Magnesium]]||Mg<sup>2+</sup>||\n|-\n|Manganese(II)||Mn<sup>2+</sup>||\n|-\n|Mercury(II)||Hg<sup>2+</sup>||mercuric\n|-\n|[[Potassium]] ||K<sup>+</sup>||kalic <!-- The noun \"kalium\" is used more commonly than the adjective \"kalic\".-->\n|-\n|[[Silver]]||Ag<sup>+</sup>||argentous\n|-\n|[[Sodium]]||Na<sup>+</sup>||natric <!-- The noun \"natrium\" is used more commonly than the adjective \"natric\".-->\n|-\n|[[Strontium]]||Sr<sup>2+</sup>||\n|-\n|Tin(II)||Sn<sup>2+</sup>||stannous\n|-\n|Tin(IV)||Sn<sup>4+</sup>||stannic\n|-\n|[[Zinc]]||Zn<sup>2+</sup>||\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:aliceblue;\"|''Polyatomic cations''\n|-\n|[[Ammonium]]||{{chem|NH|4|+}}||\n|-\n|[[Hydronium]]||H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>||\n|-\n|Mercury(I)||{{chem|Hg|2|2+}}||mercurous\n|}\n|valign=\"top\"|\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Common anions\n|-\n!style=\"text-align: left\"|Formal name\n!style=\"text-align: left\"|Formula\n!style=\"text-align: left\"|Alt. name\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:aliceblue;\"|''Simple anions''\n|-\n|[[Azide]]||{{chem|N|3|\u2212}}||\n|-\n|[[Bromide]]||Br<sup>\u2212</sup>||\n|-\n|[[Chloride]]||Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>||\n|-\n|[[Fluoride]]||F<sup>\u2212</sup>||\n|-\n|[[Hydride]]||H<sup>\u2212</sup>||\n|-\n|[[Iodide]]||I<sup>\u2212</sup>||\n|-\n|[[Nitride]]||N<sup>3\u2212</sup>||\n|-\n|[[Oxide]]||O<sup>2\u2212</sup>||\n|-\n|[[Sulfide]]||S<sup>2\u2212</sup>||\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:aliceblue;\"|''Oxoanions''\n|-\n|[[Carbonate]]||{{chem|CO|3|2\u2212}}||\n|-\n|[[Chlorate]]||{{chem|ClO|3|\u2212}}||\n|-\n|[[Chromate]]||{{chem|CrO|4|2\u2212}}||\n|-\n|[[Dichromate]]||{{chem|Cr|2|O|7|2\u2212}}||\n|-\n|Dihydrogen phosphate||{{chem|H|2|PO|4|\u2212}}||\n|-\n|[[Hydrogen carbonate]]||{{chem|HCO|3|\u2212}}||bicarbonate\n|-\n|[[Hydrogen sulfate]]||{{chem|HSO|4|\u2212}}||bisulfate\n|-\n|[[Hydrogen sulfite]]||{{chem|HSO|3|\u2212}}||bisulfite\n|-\n|[[Hydroxide]]||OH<sup>\u2212</sup>||\n|-\n|[[Hypochlorite]]||ClO<sup>\u2212</sup>||\n|-\n|Monohydrogen phosphate||{{chem|HPO|4|2\u2212}}||\n|-\n|[[Nitrate]]||{{chem|NO|3|\u2212}}||\n|-\n|[[Nitrite]]||{{chem|NO|2|\u2212}}||\n|-\n|[[Perchlorate]]||{{chem|ClO|4|\u2212}}||\n|-\n|[[Permanganate]]||{{chem|MnO|4|\u2212}}||\n|-\n|[[Peroxide]]||{{chem|O|2|2\u2212}}||\n|-\n|[[Phosphate]]||{{chem|PO|4|3\u2212}}||\n|-\n|[[Sulfate]]||{{chem|SO|4|2\u2212}}||\n|-\n|[[Sulfite]]||{{chem|SO|3|2\u2212}}||\n|-\n|[[Superoxide]]||{{chem|O|2|\u2212}}||\n|-\n|[[Thiosulfate]]||{{chem|S|2|O|3|2\u2212}}||\n|-\n|[[Silicate]]||{{chem|SiO|4|4\u2212}}||\n|-\n|[[Metasilicate (disambiguation)|Metasilicate]]||{{chem|SiO|3|2\u2212}}||\n|-\n|[[Aluminium silicate]]||{{chem|AlSiO|4|\u2212}}||\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:aliceblue;\"|''Anions from organic acids''\n|-\n|[[Acetate]]||{{chem|CH|3|COO|\u2212}}||ethanoate\n|-\n|[[Formate]]||{{chem|HCOO|\u2212}}||methanoate\n|-\n|[[Oxalate]]||{{chem|C|2|O|4|2\u2212}}||ethanedioate\n|-\n|[[Cyanide]]||CN<sup>\u2212</sup>||\n|}\n|}\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin|3}}\n* [[Air ionizer]]\n* [[Auroras]]\n* [[Gaseous ionization detectors]]\n* [[Ion beam]]\n* [[Ion exchange]]\n* [[Ionizing radiation]]\n* [[List of plasma (physics) articles]]\n* [[List of oxidation states of the elements]]\n* [[Stopping power (particle radiation)|Stopping power of radiation particles]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Galvanic cells|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Ions| ]]\n[[Category:Physical chemistry]]\n[[Category:Charge carriers]]"}]}}}}
