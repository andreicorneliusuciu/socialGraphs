They were adapted to provide a [[user interface]] to early [[mainframe computer]]s and [[minicomputer]]s, sending typed data to the computer and printing the response. Some models could also be used to create [[punched tape]] for [[Computer data storage|data storage]] (either from typed input or from data received from a remote source) and to read back such tape for local printing or transmission.\n\nTeleprinters could use a variety of different communication media. These included a simple pair of wires, dedicated non-switched telephone circuits (leased lines), switched networks that operated similarly to the public telephone network ([[telex]]), and radio and [[microwave]] links (telex-on-radio or TOR). A teleprinter attached to a [[modem]] could also communicate through standard switched public telephone lines. This latter configuration was often used to connect teleprinters to remote computers, particularly in [[time-sharing]] environments.\n\nTeleprinters have largely been replaced by fully electronic [[computer terminal]]s which usually use a [[computer monitor]] instead of a printer (though the term \"TTY\" is still occasionally used to refer to them, such as in [[Unix]] systems). Teleprinters are still widely used in the aviation industry ([[Aeronautical Fixed Telecommunication Network|AFTN]] and [[airline teletype system]]), and variations called [[Telecommunications device for the deaf|Telecommunications Devices for the Deaf]] (TDDs) are used by the [[hearing loss|hearing impaired]] for typed communications over ordinary telephone lines.\n\n==History==\nThe teleprinter evolved through a series of inventions by a number of engineers, including [[Royal Earl House]], [[David Edward Hughes]], [[Emile Baudot]], [[Donald Murray (inventor)|Donald Murray]],  [[Charles L. Krum]], [[Edward Kleinschmidt]] and [[Frederick G. Creed]]. Teleprinters were invented in order to send and receive messages without the need for operators trained in the use of Morse code. A system of two teleprinters, with one operator trained to use a typewriter, replaced two trained Morse code operators.  The teleprinter system improved message speed and delivery time, making it possible for messages to be flashed across a country with little manual intervention.<ref name=\"query.nytimes.com\">{{Citation| title = Typewriter May Soon Be Transmitter of Telegrams\n| newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = January 25, 1914| url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F70D12FF355D13738DDDAC0A94D9405B848DF1D3}}</ref>\n\nBy 1846, the [[Samuel Morse|Morse]] telegraph service was operational between Washington, D.C., and New York. [[Royal Earl House]] patented his [[printing telegraph]] that same year. He linked two 28-key piano-style keyboards by wire. Each piano key represented a letter of the alphabet and when pressed caused the corresponding letter to print at the receiving end. A \"shift\" key gave each main key two optional values. A 56-character typewheel at the sending end was synchronised to coincide with a similar wheel at the receiving end. If the key corresponding to a particular character was pressed at the home station, it actuated the typewheel at the distant station just as the same character moved into the printing position, in a way similar to the [[daisy wheel printer]]. It was thus an example of a synchronous data transmission system. House's equipment could transmit around 40 instantly readable words per minute, but was difficult to manufacture in bulk. The printer could copy and print out up to 2,000 words per hour. This invention was first put in operation and exhibited at the [[Mechanics Institute]] in New York in 1844.\n\nLandline teleprinter operations began in 1849 when a circuit was put in service between Philadelphia and New York City.<ref>''RTTY Journal'' Vol. 25 No. 9, October 1977: 2.</ref>\n\nIn 1855, [[David Edward Hughes]] introduced an improved machine built on the work of Royal Earl House. In less than two years, a number of small telegraph companies, including [[Western Union]] in early stages of development, united to form one large corporation \u2013 Western Union Telegraph Co. appeared to carry on the business of telegraphy on the Hughes system.<ref name=\"Clarkson\">{{cite web | url = http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/hughes.html | title = David Edward Hughes | accessdate =September 29, 2010 | date = April 14, 2007 | publisher = Clarkson University | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080422072443/http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/hughes.html | archivedate = April 22, 2008}}</ref>\n\n[[\u00c9mile Baudot]] designed a system using a five unit code in 1874. The Baudot system was adopted in France in 1877, and later extensively in France. The British Post Office adopted the Baudot system for use on a simplex circuit between London and Paris in 1897, and subsequently made considerable use of duplex Baudot systems on their Inland Telegraph Services.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hobbs  |first=Alan G. |title=Five-unit codes|url=http://www.nadcomm.com/fiveunit/fiveunits.htm| accessdate =May 1, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nDuring 1901 Baudot's code was modified by [[Donald Murray (inventor)|Donald Murray]] (1865\u20131945), prompted by his development of a typewriter-like keyboard. The Murray system employed an intermediate step, a keyboard perforator, which allowed an operator to punch a [[paper tape]], and a tape transmitter for sending the message from the punched tape. At the receiving end of the line, a printing mechanism would print on a paper tape, and/or a reperforator could be used to make a perforated copy of the message.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Foster |first=Maximilian |date=August 1901 |title=A Successful Printing Telegraph |journal=[[World's Work|The World's Work: A History of Our Time]] |volume=II |pages=1195\u20131199 |id= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IF6tNZnhO7wC&pg=PA1195|accessdate=July 9, 2009 |quote= }}</ref> As there was no longer a direct correlation between the operator's hand movement and the bits transmitted, there was no concern about arranging the code to minimize operator fatigue, and instead Murray designed the code to minimize wear on the machinery, assigning the code combinations with the fewest punched holes to the most [[letter frequencies|frequently used characters]]. The Murray code also introduced what became known as \"format effectors\" or \"[[control character]]s\" \u2013 the [[Carriage return|CR]] (Carriage Return) and [[Newline|LF]] (Line Feed) codes. A few of Baudot's codes moved to the positions where they have stayed ever since: the NULL or BLANK and the DEL code. NULL/BLANK was used as an idle code for when no messages were being sent.<ref name=\"query.nytimes.com\"/>\n\nIn 1902, electrical engineer Frank Pearne approached [[Joy Morton]], head of [[Morton Salt]], seeking a sponsor for research into the practicalities of developing a [[printing telegraph]] system. Joy Morton needed to determine whether this was worthwhile and so consulted mechanical engineer [[Charles L. Krum]], who was vice president of the Western Cold Storage Company. Krum was interested in helping Pearne, so space was set up in a laboratory in the attic of Western Cold Storage. Frank Pearne lost interest in the project after a year and left to get involved in teaching. Krum was prepared to continue Pearne\u2019s work, and in August, 1903 a patent was filed for a \u2018typebar page printer\u2019.<ref>{{cite web | \nurl=http://patimg1.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=00888335&homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526d%3DPALL%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526s1%3D0888335.PN.%2526OS%3DPN%2F0888335%2526RS%3DPN%2F0888335&PageNum=&Rtype=&SectionNum=&idkey=NONE&Input=View+first+page | title=U.S. Patent 888,335 issued in May, 1908| accessdate=August 13, 2011}}</ref> In 1904, Krum filed a patent for a \u2018type wheel printing telegraph machine\u2019<ref>{{cite web | \nurl=http://patimg1.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=00862402&homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526d%3DPALL%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526s1%3D0862402.PN.%2526OS%3DPN%2F0862402%2526RS%3DPN%2F0862402&PageNum=&Rtype=&SectionNum=&idkey=NONE&Input=View+first+page | title=U.S. Patent 862,402| accessdate=August 13, 2011}}</ref> which was issued in August, 1907.

The new company combined the best features of both their machines into a new typewheel printer for which Kleinschmidt, Howard Krum, and Sterling Morton jointly obtained a patent.<ref name=historytelcom/>\n\nIn 1924 [[Creed & Company]], founded by [[Frederick G. Creed]], entered the teleprinter field with their Model 1P, a page printer, which was soon superseded by the improved Model 2P. In 1925 Creed acquired the patents for Donald Murray's Murray code, a rationalised Baudot code. The Model 3 tape printer, Creed\u2019s first combined start-stop machine, was introduced in 1927 for the Post office telegram service.  This machine printed received messages directly on to gummed paper tape at a rate of 65 words per minute. Creed created his first keyboard perforator, which used compressed air to punch the holes. He also created a reperforator (receiving perforator) and a printer. The reperforator punched incoming Morse signals on to paper tape and the printer decoded this tape to produce alphanumeric characters on plain paper. This was the origin of the Creed High Speed Automatic Printing System, which could run at an unprecedented 200 words per minute. His system was adopted by the Daily Mail for daily transmission of the newspaper contents. The Creed Model 7 page printing teleprinter was introduced in 1931 and was used for the inland Telex service. It worked at a speed of 50 baud, about 66 words a minute, using a code based on the Murray code.\n\nA Teletype system was installed in the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] Flight Service Station Airway Radio Stations system in 1928, carrying administrative messages, flight information and weather reports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atchistory.org/History/fsshist.htm|title= Flight Service History 1920-1998}}</ref>  By 1938, the FAA's Teletype network, handling weather traffic, extended over 20,000 miles, covering all 48 states except Maine, New Hampshire, and South Dakota.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/media/b-chron.pdf|title=FAA HISTORICAL CHRONOLOGY, 1926-1996}}</ref>\n\n==Ways in which teleprinters were used==\nThere were at least five major types of teleprinter networks:\n\n* Exchange systems such as [[Telex]] and [[Telex#Teletypewriter eXchange|TWX]]. These created a real-time circuit between two machines, so that anything typed on one machine appeared at the other end immediately. US and UK systems had actual telephone dials, and prior to 1981 five U.S. [[area codes]] were reserved for teletype use; German systems did \"dialing\" via the keyboard. Typed \"chat\" was possible, but because billing was by connect time, it was common to prepare messages on [[Punched tape|paper tape]] and transmit them without pauses for typing.\n* [[Leased line]] and [[radioteletype]] networks arranged in point-to-point and / or multipoint configurations to support [[data processing]] applications for government and industry such as integrating the accounting, billing, management, production, purchasing, sales, shipping and receiving departments within an organization to speed internal communications.\n* [[Message switching]] systems. This was an early form of E-mail, done with electromechanical gear.  See [[Telegram]], [[Western Union]], [[Plan 55-A]]. Military organizations had similar but separate systems. See [[Autodin]].\n* Broadcast systems such as weather information distribution and \"news wires\". See [[Associated Press]], [[National Weather Service]], [[Reuters]], and United Press (later [[UPI]]). News was received on receive-only teleprinters, without keyboards or dials.\n* \"Loop\" systems, where anything typed on any machine on the loop printed on all the machines. Police departments used such systems to interconnect precincts. {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\n==Teleprinter operation==\n[[Image:Baudotkeyboard.png|right|frame|422px|[[Alphanumeric keyboard|Keyboard]] of a [[Baudot code|Baudot Teletype]], with 32 keys, including the space bar]]\nMost teleprinters used the 5-[[bit]] [[Baudot code]] (also known as [[Baudot code|ITA2]]). This limited the character set to 32 codes (2<sup>5</sup> = 32). One had to use a \"FIGS\" [[shift key]] to type numbers and special characters. Special versions of teleprinters had FIGS characters for specific applications, such as weather symbols for weather reports. Print quality was poor by modern standards. The Baudot code was used [[asynchronous start-stop|asynchronously with start and stop bits]]: the asynchronous code design was intimately linked with the start-stop electro-mechanical design of teleprinters. (Early systems had used synchronous codes, but were hard to synchronize mechanically). Other codes, such as [[ASCII]], [[FIELDATA]] and [[Flexowriter]], were introduced but never became as popular as Baudot.\n\n''Mark'' and ''space'' are terms describing [[logic level]]s in teleprinter circuits. The native mode of communication for a teleprinter is a simple series [[direct current circuit|DC circuit]] that is interrupted, much as a [[rotary dial]] interrupts a telephone signal. The marking condition is when the circuit is closed (current is flowing), the spacing condition is when the circuit is open (no current is flowing). The \"idle\" condition of the circuit is a continuous marking state, with the start of a character signalled by a \"start bit\", which is always a space. Following the start bit, the character is represented by a fixed number of bits, such as 5 bits in the Baudot code, each either a mark or a space to denote the specific character or machine function. After the character's bits, the sending machine sends one or more stop bits. The stop bits are marking, so as to be distinct from the subsequent start bit. If the sender has nothing more to send, the line simply remains in the marking state (as if a continuing series of stop bits) until a later space denotes the start of the next character. The time between characters need not be an integral multiple of a bit time, but it must be at least the minimum number of stop bits required by the receiving machine.\n\nWhen the line is broken, the continuous spacing (open circuit, no current flowing) causes a receiving teleprinter to cycle continuously, even in the absence of stop bits. It prints nothing because the characters received are all zeros, the [[Baudot code|Baudot]] blank (or [[ASCII]]) [[null character]].\n\nTeleprinter circuits were generally leased from a communications [[common carrier]] and consisted of [[twisted pair]] [[copper wire]]s through ordinary telephone cables that extended from the teleprinter located at the customer location to the common carrier [[telephone exchange|central office]].  These teleprinter circuits were connected to switching equipment at the central office for [[Telex]] and [[Telegraphy#TWX|TWX]] service. [[Private line]] teleprinter circuits were not directly connected to switching equipment. Instead, these private line circuits were connected to [[network hub]]s and [[repeater]]s configured to provide point to point or point to multipoint service. More than two teleprinters could be connected to the same wire circuit by means of a [[current loop]].\n\nEarlier teleprinters had three rows of keys and only supported upper case letters. They used the 5 bit [[baudot code]] and generally worked at 60 to 100 words per minute. Later teleprinters, specifically the [[Teletype Model 33]], used ASCII code, an innovation that came into widespread use in the 1960s as computers became more widely available.\n\n\"Speed\", intended to be roughly comparable to [[words per minute]], is the standard term introduced by [[Western Union]] for a mechanical teleprinter data transmission rate using the 5-bit [[baudot code]] that was popular in the 1940s and for several decades thereafter. Such a machine would send 1 start bit, 5 data bits, and 1.42 stop bits. This unusual stop bit time is actually a rest period to allow the mechanical printing mechanism to synchronize in the event that a garbled signal is received.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.samhallas.co.uk/repository/telegraph/introduction_to_RTTY.pdf |title= Introduction to RTTY}}</ref> This is true especially on [[High frequency]] radio circuits where selective fading is present. Selective fading causes the mark signal amplitude to be randomly different from the space signal amplitude. Selective fading, or [[Rayleigh fading]] can cause two carriers to randomly and independently fade to different depths.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://w7ay.net/site/Technical/RTTY%20Demodulators/index.html |title= RTTY Demodulators}}</ref>  Since modern computer equipment cannot easily generate 1.42 bits for the stop period, common practice is to either approximate this with 1.5 bits, or to send 2.0 bits while accepting 1.0 bits receiving.\n\nFor example, a \"60 speed\" machine is geared at 45.5 [[baud]] (22.0 [[millisecond|ms]] per bit), a \"66 speed\" machine is geared at 50.0 [[baud]] (20.0 ms per bit), a \"75 speed\" machine is geared at 56.9 baud (17.5 ms per bit), a \"100 speed\" machine is geared at 74.2 baud (13.5 ms per bit), and a \"133 speed\" machine is geared at 100.0 baud (10.0 ms per bit). 60 speed became the ''de facto'' standard for [[amateur radio]] [[radioteletype|RTTY]] operation because of the widespread availability of equipment at that speed and the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) restrictions to only 60 speed from 1953 to 1972. Telex, [[news agency]] wires and similar services commonly used 66 speed services. There was some migration to 75 and 100 speed as more reliable devices were introduced. However, the limitations of HF transmission such as excessive error rates due to multipath distortion and the nature of ionospheric propagation kept many users at 60 and 66 speed.  Most Teletype audio recordings in existence today are of teleprinters operating at 60 words per minute, and mostly of the Teletype Model 15.\n\nAnother measure of the speed of a Teletype machine was in total \"operations per minute (OPM)\".  For example, 60 speed was usually 368 OPM, 66 speed was 404 OPM, 75 speed was 460 OPM, and 100 speed was 600 OPM.  Western Union Telexes were usually set at 390 OPM, with 7.0 total bits instead of the customary 7.42 bits.\n\nBoth wire-service and private teleprinters had bells to signal important incoming messages and could ring 24/7 while the  power was turned on.  For example, ringing 4 bells on UPI wire-service machines meant an \"Urgent\" message; 5 bells was a \"Bulletin\"; and 10 bells was a FLASH, used only for very important news, such as the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]].\n\nThe teleprinter circuit was often linked to a 5-bit [[punched tape|paper tape]] punch (or \"reperforator\") and reader, allowing messages received to be resent on another circuit. Complex military and commercial communications networks were built using this technology. Message centers had rows of teleprinters and large racks for paper tapes awaiting transmission.  Skilled operators could read the priority code from the hole pattern and might even feed a \"FLASH PRIORITY\" tape into a reader while it was still coming out of the punch. Routine traffic often had to wait hours for relay. Many teleprinters had built-in paper tape readers and punches, allowing messages to be saved in machine-readable form and edited [[off-line]].\n\nCommunication by radio, [[radioteletype|RTTY]], was also common. [[Amateur radio]] operators continue to use this mode of communication today.\n\n===Control characters===\n{{Main|Control character}}\nA typewriter or electromechanical printer can print characters on paper, and execute operations such as move the carriage back to the left margin of the same line ([[carriage return]]), advance to the same column of the next line ([[line feed]]), and so on. Commands to control non-printing operations were transmitted in exactly the same way as printable characters by sending control characters with defined functions (e.g., the ''line feed'' character forced the carriage to move to the same position on the next line) to teleprinters. In modern computing and communications a few control characters, such as carriage return and line feed, have retained their original functions (although they are often implemented in software rather than activating electromechanical mechanisms to move a physical printer carriage) but many others are no longer required and are used for other purposes.\n\n===\"Here is\" key===\n\nSome teleprinters had a \"Here is\" key, which transmitted a fixed sequence 20 or 22 characters, programmable by breaking tabs off a drum. This sequence could also be transmitted automatically upon receipt of an [[ENQ]] (control E) signal, if enabled.<ref name=\"Hereis\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdp8.net/asr33/pics/main_back.shtml |title=ASR 33 Teletype Rear View of Main Assembly}}</ref><ref name=\"AnotherHereis\">{{cite web |url=http://www.k7tty.com/development/teletype/model-32/index.html |title=Teletype Model 32ASR}}</ref> This was commonly used to identify a station; the operator could press the key to send the station identifier to the other end, or the remote station could trigger its transmission by sending the ENQ character, essentially asking \"who are you?\"\n\n==Manufacturers==\n\n===Creed & Company===\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2008-0516-500, Fernschreibmaschine mit Telefonanschluss.jpg|thumb|A British [[Creed & Company]] Teleprinter No. 7 in 1930]]\n[[Creed & Company]], a British company, built teleprinters for the [[General Post Office|GPO]]'s teleprinter service.\n\n* Creed model 7E (with overlap cam and range finder)\n* Creed model 7B\n* Creed model 7\n* Creed model 7/RP (teleprinter reperforator)\n* Creed model 54\n* Creed model 75\n* Creed model 85 (reperforator)\n* Creed model 86 (reperforator)\n* Creed model 444 (GPO type 15)\n\n===Kleinschmidt Labs===\nIn 1931 Edward Kleinschmidt formed [[Kleinschmidt Inc|Kleinschmidt Labs]] to pursue a different type design of Teletype.

In 1956 Kleinschmidt Labs merged with [[Smith-Corona]], which then merged with the [[Marchant Calculator|Marchant Calculating Machine Co.]], forming the SCM Corporation. By 1979 the Kleinschmidt division was branching off into Electronic Data Interchange, a business in which they became very successful, and replaced the mechanical products, including teleprinters.\n\nKleinschmidt machines, with the military as their primary customer, used standard military designations for their machines.  The teleprinter was identified with designations such as a TT-4/FG, while communication \"sets\" to which a teleprinter might be a part generally used the standard Army/Navy designation system such as AN/FGC-25.  This includes Kleinschmidt teleprinter TT-117/FG and tape reperforator TT-179/FG.\n\n===Morkrum===\n[[Morkrum]] made their first commercial installation of a printing telegraph with the Postal Telegraph Company in Boston and New York in 1910.<ref>{{cite book |author=Colin Hempstead, William E.

In 1925, a merger between Morkrum and Kleinschmidt Electric Company created the Morkrum-Kleinschmidt Company. The name was changed in December 1928 to Teletype Corporation.  In 1930, Teletype Corporation was purchased by the [[American Telephone and Telegraph Company]] and became a subsidiary of [[Western Electric]]. In 1984, the divestiture of the Bell System resulted in the Teletype name and logo being replaced by the AT&T name and logo, eventually resulting in the brand being extinguished.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kekatos.com/teletype/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603235022/http://www.kekatos.com/teletype/ |title=History of The Teletype Corporation|accessdate=March 3, 2010|archivedate=June 3, 2008}}</ref> The last vestiges of what had been the Teletype Corporation ceased in 1990, bringing to a close the dedicated teleprinter business.

The production run was stretched somewhat by World War II\u2014the Model 28 was scheduled to replace the Model 15 in the mid-1940s, but Teletype built so many factories to produce the Model 15 during World War II, it was more economical to continue mass production of the Model 15.

There is at least one item that points to Telex using Teleprinter#Telex as the link. (probably should be redirected to telegraphy--agr) -->\nA global teleprinter network, called the \"[[Telegraphy#Teleprinters|Telex network]]\", was developed in the late 1920s, and was used through most of the 20th century for business communications.  The main difference from a standard teleprinter is that Telex includes a switched routing network, originally based on pulse-telephone dialing, which in the United States was provided by Western Union. AT&T developed a competing network called \"[[Telegraphy#TWX|TWX]]\" which initially also used rotary dialing and Baudot code, carried to the customer premises as pulses of DC on a metallic copper pair. TWX later added a second ASCII-based service using [[Bell 103 modem|Bell 103]] type modems served over lines whose physical interface was identical to regular telephone lines. In many cases, the TWX service was provided by the same telephone central office that handled voice calls, using class of service to prevent [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] customers from connecting to TWX customers. Telex is still in use in some countries for certain applications such as shipping, news, weather reporting and military command.  Many business applications have moved to the Internet as most countries have discontinued telex/TWX services.\n\n==Teletypesetter==\nIn addition to the 5-bit Baudot code and the much later seven-bit ASCII code, there was a six-bit code known as the TTS code (Teletypesetter)<ref>[http://inventors.about.com/od/pstartinventions/a/printing.htm The History of Printing and Printing Processes], retrieved 2008 July 15</ref> used by news wire services.  Through the use of \"shift in\" and \"shift out\" codes, this six-bit code could represent a full set of upper and lower case characters, digits, symbols commonly used in newspapers, and limited typesetting instructions such as \"flush left\" or \"center\". A Model 20 Teletype machine with a punch (\"reperforator\") was installed at subscriber newspaper sites.  Originally these machines would simply punch paper tapes and these tapes could be read by a tape reader attached to a [[Linotype machine]], creating type for printing in newspapers and magazines.  In later years the incoming 6-bit current loop signal was coupled directly into a minicomputer or mainframe for storage, editing, and eventual feed to a phototypesetting machine.\n\n==Teleprinters in computing==<!-- This section is linked from [[Line printer]] -->\nComputers used teleprinters for input and output from the early days of computing. [[Punched card]] readers and fast printers replaced teleprinters for most purposes, but teleprinters continued to be used as interactive [[time-sharing]] [[computer terminal|terminals]] until video [[computer display|display]]s became widely available in the  late 1970s.\n\nUsers typed commands after a [[Command-line interface#Command prompt|prompt]] character was printed. Printing was unidirectional; if the user wanted to delete what had been typed, further characters were printed to indicate that previous text had been cancelled. When video displays first became available the user interface was initially exactly the same as for an electromechanical printer; expensive and scarce video terminals could be used interchangeably with teleprinters. This was the origin of the [[text terminal]] and the [[command-line interface]].\n\n[[File:ASR-33 Teletype terminal IMG 1658.jpg|thumb|A Teletype Model 33 ASR with paper tape reader and punch, as used for [[modem]]-based computing]]\nPaper tape was sometimes used to prepare input for the computer session off line and to capture computer output. The popular [[Teletype Model 33]] used 7-bit [[ASCII]] code (with an eighth [[parity bit]]) instead of Baudot. The common [[modem]] communications settings, ''Start/Stop Bits'' and ''Parity,'' stem from the Teletype era.\n\nIn early operating systems such as [[Digital Equipment Corporation|Digital's]] [[RT-11]], serial communication lines were often connected to teleprinters and were given device names starting with <tt>tt</tt>. This and similar conventions were adopted by many other operating systems. [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s use the [[prefix]] <tt>tty</tt>, for example <tt>/dev/tty13</tt>, or <tt>pty</tt> (for pseudo-tty), such as <tt>/dev/ptya0</tt>. In many computing contexts, \"TTY\" has become the name for any text terminal, such as an external [[system console|console]] device, a user dialing in to the system on a [[modem]] on a [[serial port]] device, a printing or graphical [[computer terminal]] on a computer's serial port or the [[RS-232]] port on a [[USB]]-to-RS-232 converter attached to a computer's USB port, or even a [[terminal emulator]] application in the window system using a [[pseudoterminal]] device.\n\nTeleprinters were also used to record fault printout and other information in some [[TXE]] telephone exchanges.\n\n==Obsolescence of teleprinters==\nAlthough printing news, messages, and other text at a distance is still universal, the dedicated teleprinter tied to a pair of leased copper wires was made functionally obsolete by the [[fax]], personal computer, [[inkjet printer]], broadband, and the Internet.\n\nIn the 1980s, [[packet radio]] became the most common form of digital communications used in amateur radio.  Soon, advanced multimode electronic interfaces such as the AEA PK-232 were developed, which could send and receive not only packet, but various other modulation types including Baudot.  This made it possible for a home or laptop computer to replace teleprinters, saving money, complexity, space and the massive amount of paper which mechanical machines used.\n\nAs a result, by the mid-1990s, amateur use of actual Teletype machines had waned, though a core of \"purists\" still operate on equipment originally manufactured in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.\n\nDespite the obsolescence of teleprinters by the 21st century, its distinctive sound continues to be played in the background of newscasts on the New York City radio station [[WINS (AM)|WINS]], a tradition dating back to the mid-1960s.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Letter-quality printer]]\n* [[Plan 55-A]], a [[message switching]] system for telegrams.\n* [[Radioteletype]]\n* [[Siemens and Halske T52]] \u2013 the ''Geheimfernschreiber'' (''secrets teleprinter'')\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=g_EDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA577#v=onepage&f=true \"Teletype Messages Sent Through Switch Board\"], ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'', April 1932.
