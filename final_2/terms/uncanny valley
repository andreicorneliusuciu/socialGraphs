Automatic, stimulus-driven appraisals of uncanny stimuli elicit aversion by activating an evolved [[cognitive]] mechanism for the avoidance of [[Mate choice|selecting mates]] with low [[fertility]], poor [[Endocrine system|hormonal health]], or ineffective [[immune system]]s based on visible features of the face and body that are predictive of those traits.<ref>Green, MacDorman, Ho, Koch, 2008.</ref><ref name=\"Rhodes, G. 2002\">Rhodes, G. & Zebrowitz, L.

Uncanny stimuli may activate a cognitive mechanism that originally evolved to motivate the avoidance of potential sources of pathogens by eliciting a disgust response. \"The more human an organism looks, the stronger the aversion to its defects, because (1) defects indicate disease, (2) more human-looking organisms are more closely related to human beings genetically, and (3) the probability of contracting disease-causing [[bacteria]], [[viruses]], and other [[parasite]]s increases with genetic similarity.\"<ref name=\"Rhodes, G. 2002\"/><ref>MacDorman, Green, Ho, & Koch, 2009, p. 696.</ref> The visual anomalies of androids, robots, and other animated human characters cause reactions of alarm and revulsion, similar to corpses and visibly diseased individuals.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=S.

Stimuli with human and nonhuman traits undermine our sense of human identity by linking qualitatively different categories, human and nonhuman, by a quantitative metric, degree of human likeness.<ref>Ramey, 2005.</ref>\n* '''Violation of human norms.''' The uncanny valley may \"be symptomatic of entities that elicit a model of a human other but do not measure up to it\".<ref>MacDorman & Ishiguro, 2006, p. 303.</ref> If an entity looks sufficiently nonhuman, its human characteristics will be noticeable, generating empathy. However, if the entity looks almost human, it will elicit our model of a human other and its detailed normative expectations. The nonhuman characteristics will be noticeable, giving the human viewer a sense of strangeness. In other words, a robot stuck inside the uncanny valley is no longer being judged by the standards of a robot doing a passable job at pretending to be human, but is instead being judged by the standards of a human doing a terrible job at acting like a normal person. This has been linked to perceptual uncertainty and the theory of predictive coding.<ref name = \"SayginSCAN\">{{cite journal| last=Saygin| first=A.P.|title=The Thing That Should Not Be: Predictive Coding and the Uncanny Valley in Perceiving Human and Humanoid Robot Actions. |journal=Social Cognitive Affective Neuroscience| year=2011 | volume = 7| pages = 413\u201322| url=http://scan.oxfordjournals.org/content/7/4/413 | doi=10.1093/scan/nsr025}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=UCSD News|title=Your Brain on Androids|url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/newsrel/soc/20110714BrainAndroids.asp}}</ref>\n* '''Religious definition of human identity.'''

Yalom explains that humans construct psychological defenses in order to avoid existential anxiety stemming from death.

The negative effect associated with uncanny stimuli is produced by the activation of conflicting cognitive representations. Perceptual tension occurs when an individual perceives conflicting cues to [[Categorization|category]] membership, such as when a humanoid figure moves like a robot, or has other visible robot features. This cognitive conflict is experienced as psychological discomfort (i.e., \"eeriness\"), much like the discomfort that is experienced with [[cognitive dissonance]].<ref name=\"Ferrey2015\">{{cite journal | last1 = Ferrey | first1 = A.

Mathur MB & Reichling DB<ref name=\"Mathur2016\"/> used two complementary sets of stimuli spanning the range from very mechanical to very human-like: first, a sample of 80 objectively chosen robot face images from Internet searches, and second, a morphometrically and graphically controlled 6-face series set of faces. They asked subjects to explicitly rate the likability of each face. To measure trust toward each face, subjects completed a one-shot investment game to indirectly measure how much money they were willing to \"wager\" on a robot's trustworthiness. Both stimulus sets showed a robust Uncanny Valley effect on explicitly-rated likability and a more context-dependent Uncanny Valley on implicitly-rated trust. Their exploratory analysis of one proposed mechanism for the Uncanny Valley, perceptual confusion at a category boundary, found that category confusion occurs in the Uncanny Valley but does not mediate the effect on social and emotional responses.\n[[File:Uncanny valley.png|thumb|450x450px|An empirically estimated Uncanny Valley for static robot face images<ref name=\"Mathur2016\"/>]]\n\nOne study conducted in 2009 examined the evolutionary mechanism behind the aversion associated with the uncanny valley. A group of five monkeys were shown three images: two different 3D&nbsp;monkey faces (realistic, unrealistic), and a real photo of a monkey's face. The monkeys' eye-gaze was used as a proxy for preference or aversion. Since the realistic 3D&nbsp;monkey face was looked at less than either the real photo, or the unrealistic 3D&nbsp;monkey face, this was interpreted as an indication that the monkey participants found the realistic 3D&nbsp;face aversive, or otherwise preferred the other two images. As one would expect with the uncanny valley, more realism can lead to less positive reactions, and this study demonstrated that neither human-specific cognitive processes, nor human culture explain the uncanny valley. In other words, this aversive reaction to realism can be said to be evolutionary in origin.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kitta MacPherson |url=http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S25/53/99A37/index.xml?section=topstories |title=Monkey visual behavior falls into the uncanny valley |publisher= Princeton University |date=2009-10-13 |accessdate=2011-03-20}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2011, researchers at [[University of California, San Diego]] and [[California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology]] are measuring human brain activations related to the uncanny valley.<ref>{{cite news|title=Science Exploring the uncanny valley of how brains react to humanoids| url=http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-07/19/uncanny-valley-tested}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Ramsey |first=Doug |url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/newsrel/science/05-13ResearchOpportunities.asp |title=Nineteen Projects Awarded Inaugural Calit2 Strategic Research Opportunities Grants |publisher=UCSD  |date=2010-05-13 |accessdate= 2011-03-20}}</ref> In one study using [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]], a group of cognitive scientists and roboticists found the biggest differences in brain responses for uncanny robots in [[Parietal lobe|parietal cortex]], on both sides of the brain, specifically in the areas that connect the part of the brain\u2019s [[visual cortex]] that processes bodily movements with the section of the [[motor cortex]] thought to contain [[mirror neuron]]s.
