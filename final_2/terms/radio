In practice, [[radio frequency|radio frequencies]] are significantly below that of [[visible light]] from about {{val|3|ul=kHz}} to 300&nbsp;GHz.<ref>Dictionary of Electronics By Rudolf F. Graf (1974). Page 467.</ref> \n}} When radio waves strike an [[electrical conductor]], the oscillating fields induce an [[alternating current]] in the conductor. The information in the waves can be [[demodulation|extracted]] and transformed back into its original form.\n\nRadio systems need a [[transmitter]] to [[modulation|modulate (change)]] some property of the energy produced to impress a signal on it, for example using [[amplitude modulation]] or [[angle modulation]] (which can be [[frequency modulation]] or [[phase modulation]]). Radio systems also need an antenna to convert [[electric current]]s into [[radio wave]]s, and vice versa. An antenna can be used for both transmitting and receiving. The [[electrical resonance]] of [[tuned circuit]]s in radios allow individual stations to be selected. The electromagnetic wave is intercepted by a tuned receiving [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]. A [[radio receiver]] receives its input from an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] and converts it into a form usable for the consumer, such as sound, pictures, digital data, measurement values, navigational positions, etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/rf-technology-design/index.php |title=Radio-Electronics, '&#39;Radio Receiver Technology'&#39; |publisher=Radio-electronics.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-02}}</ref> Radio frequencies occupy the range from a 3&nbsp;kHz to 300&nbsp;GHz, although commercially important uses of radio use only a small part of this spectrum.<ref>''The Electromagnetic Spectrum'', University of Tennessee, Dept. of Physics and Astronomy</ref>\n\nA radio communication system sends signals by radio.<ref>{{cite book | title = Wireless Network Performance Handbook | author = Clint Smith, Curt Gervelis | year = 2003 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional | isbn = 0-07-140655-7 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nZAVGBoPevUC&pg=PA25&lr=&as_brr=3&ei=F4-sSKuzO6XmtgO4393BBA&sig=ACfU3U0g0vtYCOzP0LCCzdRfr7bgKwvTNg#PPA24,M1}}</ref> The [[radio equipment]] involved in [[communication system]]s includes a [[transmitter]] and a receiver, each having an antenna and appropriate [[terminal equipment]] such as a [[microphone]] at the transmitter and a [[loudspeaker]] at the receiver in the case of a voice-communication system.<ref>{{cite book | title = Solid State Physics and Electronics | author = R.

It was first applied to communications in 1881 when, at the suggestion of French scientist [[:fr:Ernest Mercadier|Ernest Mercadier]], [[Alexander Graham Bell]] adopted \"radiophone\" (meaning \"radiated sound\") as an alternate name for his [[photophone]] optical transmission system.<ref>\"Production of Sound by Radiant Energy\" by Alexander Graham Bell, ''Popular Science Monthly'', July, 1881, pages 329-330: \"[W]e have named the apparatus for the production and reproduction of sound in this way the \"photophone\", ''because an ordinary beam of light contains the rays which are operative.'' To avoid in future any misunderstandings upon this point, we have decided to adopt the term \"''radiophone''\", proposed by M. Mercadier, as a general term signifying the production of sound by any form of radiant energy...\"</ref> However, this invention would not be widely adopted.\n\nFollowing [[Heinrich Hertz]]'s establishment of the existence of [[electromagnetic radiation]] in the late 1880s, a variety of terms were initially used for the phenomenon, with early descriptions of the radiation itself including \"Hertzian waves\", \"electric waves\", and \"ether waves\", while phrases describing its use in communications included \"spark telegraphy\", \"space telegraphy\", \"aerography\" and, eventually and most commonly, \"wireless telegraphy\". However, \"wireless\" included a broad variety of related electronic technologies, including [[electrostatic induction]], [[electromagnetic induction]] and [[Electrical conductor|aquatic and earth conduction]], so there was a need for a more precise term referring exclusively to electromagnetic radiation.\n\nThe first use of ''radio-'' in conjunction with electromagnetic radiation appears to have been by French physicist [[\u00c9douard Branly]], who in 1890 developed a version of a [[coherer]] receiver he called a ''[[:fr:radioconducteur|radio-conducteur]]''.<ref>\"The Genesis of Wireless Telegraphy\" by [[Archie Frederick Collins|A. Frederick Collins]], ''Electrical World and Engineer'', May 10, 1902, page 811.</ref> The radio- prefix was later used to form additional descriptive compound and hyphenated words, especially in Europe, for example, in early 1898 the British publication ''The Practical Engineer'' included a reference to \"the radiotelegraph\" and \"radiotelegraphy\",<ref>\"Wireless Telegraphy\", ''The Practical Engineer'', February 25, 1898, page 174. \"Dr. O. J. Lodge, who preceded Marconi in making experiments in what may be called \"ray\" telegraphy or radiotelegraphy by a year or two, has devised a new method of sending and receiving the messages. The reader will understand that in the radiotelegraph electric waves forming the signals of the message start from the sending instrument and travel in all directions like rays of light from a lamp, only they are invisible.\"</ref> while the French text of both the 1903 and 1906 Berlin Radiotelegraphic Conventions includes the phrases ''radiot\u00e9l\u00e9graphique'' and ''radiot\u00e9l\u00e9grammes''.\n\nThe use of \"radio\" as a standalone word dates back to at least December 30, 1904, when instructions issued by the British Post Office for transmitting telegrams specified that \"The word 'Radio'... is sent in the Service Instructions\".<ref>\"Wireless Telegraphy\", ''The Electrical Review'' (London), January 20, 1905, page 108, quoting from the British Post Office's December 30, 1904 ''Post Office Circular''.</ref> This practice was universally adopted, and the word \"radio\" introduced internationally, by the 1906 Berlin Radiotelegraphic Convention, which included a Service Regulation specifying that \"Radiotelegrams shall show in the preamble that the service is 'Radio'\".\n\nThe switch to \"radio\" in place of \"wireless\" took place slowly and unevenly in the English-speaking world. [[Lee de Forest]] helped popularize the new word in the United States\u2014in early 1907 he founded the DeForest Radio Telephone Company, and his letter in the June 22, 1907 ''Electrical World'' about the need for legal restrictions warned that \"Radio chaos will certainly be the result until such stringent regulation is enforced\".<ref>\"Interference with Wireless Messages\", ''Electrical World'', June 22, 1907, page 1270.</ref> The United States Navy would also play a role. Although its translation of the 1906 Berlin Convention used the terms \"wireless telegraph\" and \"wireless telegram\", by 1912 it began to promote the use of \"radio\" instead. The term started to become preferred by the general public in the 1920s with the introduction of broadcasting. (\"Broadcasting\" is based upon an agricultural term meaning roughly \"scattering seeds widely\".) British Commonwealth countries continued to commonly use the term \"wireless\" until the mid-20th century, though the magazine of the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] in the UK has been called [[Radio Times]] since its founding in the early 1920s.\n\nIn recent years the more general term \"wireless\" has gained renewed popularity, even for devices using electromagnetic radiation, through the rapid growth of short-range computer networking, e.g., [[Wireless LAN|Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)]], [[Wi-Fi]], and Bluetooth, as well as mobile telephony, e.g., [[GSM]] and [[UMTS]] cell phones. Today, the term \"radio\" specifies the transceiver device or chip, whereas \"wireless\" refers to the lack of physical connections; thus equipment employs embedded ''radio'' transceivers, but operates as ''wireless'' devices over ''wireless'' sensor networks.\n\n==Processes==\n[[File:Signal processing system.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Radio communication works by transducer|Radio communication.  Information such as sound is converted by a transducer such as a [[microphone]] to an electrical signal, which modulates a [[radio wave]] sent from a [[transmitter]]. A receiver intercepts the radio wave and extracts the information-bearing electronic signal, which is converted back using another transducer such as a [[loudspeaker|speaker]].]]\nRadio systems used for [[telecommunications|communication]] have the following elements. With more than 100 years of development, each process is implemented by a wide range of methods, specialised for different communications purposes.\n\n===Transmitter and modulation===\n{{main|Radio transmitter}}\n{{see also|Radio transmitter design}}\n\nEach system contains a [[transmitter]], This consists of a source of electrical energy, producing alternating current of a desired [[frequency]] of oscillation. The transmitter contains a system to [[modulation|modulate (change)]] some property of the energy produced to impress a signal on it. This modulation might be as simple as turning the energy on and off, or altering more subtle properties such as amplitude, frequency, phase, or combinations of these properties. The transmitter sends the modulated electrical energy to a tuned [[resonance|resonant]] [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]; this structure converts the rapidly changing alternating current into an [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic wave]] that can move through free space (sometimes with a particular [[polarization (waves)|polarization]]).\n\n[[File:Amfm3-en-de.gif|thumb|right|An audio signal (top) may be carried by an AM or FM radio wave.]]\n\n[[Amplitude modulation]] of a [[carrier wave]] works by varying the strength of the transmitted signal in proportion to the information being sent.  For example, changes in the signal strength can be used to reflect the sounds to be reproduced by a speaker, or to specify the light intensity of television pixels. It was the method used for the first audio radio transmissions, and remains in use today. \"AM\" is often used to refer to the [[medium wave]] broadcast [[band (electronics)|band]] (see [[AM radio]]), but it is used in various [[radiotelephone]] services such as the [[Citizens band radio|Citizen Band]], [[amateur radio]] and especially in aviation, due to its ability to be received under very weak signal conditions and its immunity to [[capture effect]], allowing more than one signal to be heard simultaneously.\n\n[[Frequency modulation]] varies the [[frequency]] of the carrier. The instantaneous frequency of the carrier is directly proportional to the instantaneous value of the input signal.  FM has the \"[[capture effect]]\" whereby a receiver only receives the strongest signal, even when others are present.  Digital data can be sent by shifting the carrier's frequency among a set of discrete values, a technique known as [[frequency-shift keying]].  FM is commonly used at [[Very high frequency]] (VHF) [[radio frequencies]] for [[high-fidelity]] [[radio broadcasting|broadcasts]] of [[music]] and [[Speech communication|speech]] (see [[FM broadcasting]]). Analog TV sound is also broadcast using FM.\n\n[[Angle modulation]] alters the instantaneous [[phase (waves)|phase]] of the carrier wave to transmit a signal.  It may be either FM or [[phase modulation]] (PM).\n\n===Antenna===\n{{main|Antenna (radio)}}\n[[File:Antenna.jpg|upright|thumb|Rooftop [[television antenna]]s. [[Yagi-Uda antenna]]s like these six are widely used at [[Very High Frequency|VHF]] and [[Ultrahigh frequency|UHF]] frequencies.]]\n\nAn ''antenna'' (or ''aerial'') is an electrical device which converts [[electric current]]s into [[radio wave]]s, and vice versa. It is usually used with a [[transmitter|radio transmitter]] or [[receiver (radio)|radio receiver]]. In [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]], a radio transmitter supplies an electric current oscillating at radio frequency (i.e. high frequency AC) to the antenna's terminals, and the antenna radiates the energy from the current as [[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic wave]]s (radio waves). In reception, an antenna intercepts some of the power of an electromagnetic wave in order to produce a tiny voltage at its terminals, that is applied to a receiver to be [[Amplifier|amplified]].  Some antennas can be used for both transmitting and receiving, even simultaneously, depending on the connected equipment.\n\n===Propagation===\n{{main|Radio propagation}}\nOnce generated, electromagnetic waves travel through space either directly, or have their path altered by [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]], [[refraction]] or [[diffraction]]. The intensity of the waves diminishes due to geometric dispersion (the [[inverse-square law]]); some energy may also be absorbed by the intervening medium in some cases. [[Signal noise|Noise]] will generally alter the desired signal; this [[electromagnetic interference]] comes from natural sources, as well as from artificial sources such as other transmitters and accidental radiators. Noise is also produced at every step due to the inherent properties of the devices used. If the magnitude of the noise is large enough, the desired signal will no longer be discernible; the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] is the fundamental limit to the range of radio communications.\n\n===Resonance===\n\n{{Main|Electrical resonance}}\n{{see also|LC circuit}}\n\n[[Electrical resonance]] of [[tuned circuit]]s in radios allow individual stations to be selected. A resonant circuit will respond strongly to a particular frequency, and much less so to differing frequencies. This allows the radio receiver to discriminate between multiple signals differing in frequency.\n\n===Receiver and demodulation===\n{{main|Radio receiver}}\n{{see also|Radio receiver design|Crystal radio|Communications receiver}}\n\n[[File:Crystal radio receiver.PNG|thumb|A [[Crystal radio|crystal receiver]], consisting of an [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]], adjustable [[electromagnetic coil]], [[cat's whisker|crystal rectifier]], [[capacitor]], [[headphone]]s and [[Ground (electricity)|ground connection]].]]\n\nThe electromagnetic wave is intercepted by a tuned receiving [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]; this structure captures some of the energy of the wave and returns it to the form of oscillating electrical currents. At the receiver, these currents are [[Demodulation|demodulated]], which is conversion to a usable signal form by a [[Detector (radio)|detector]] sub-system. The receiver is \"[[Tuner (electronics)|tuned]]\" to respond preferentially to the desired signals, and reject undesired signals.\n\nEarly radio systems relied entirely on the energy collected by an antenna to produce signals for the operator. Radio became more useful after the invention of [[electronics|electronic]] devices such as the [[vacuum tube]] and later the [[transistor]], which made it possible to amplify weak signals. Today radio systems are used for applications from [[walkie-talkie]] children's toys to the control of [[Pioneer program|space vehicles]], as well as for [[broadcasting]], and many other applications.\n\nA ''[[radio receiver]]'' receives its input from an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]], uses [[electronic filter]]s to separate a wanted radio signal from all other signals picked up by this antenna, [[electronic amplifier|amplifies]] it to a level suitable for further processing, and finally converts through [[demodulation]] and decoding the signal into a form usable for the consumer, such as sound, pictures, digital data, measurement values, navigational positions, etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/rf-technology-design/index.php |title=Radio-Electronics, '&#39;Radio Receiver Technology'&#39; |publisher=Radio-electronics.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-02}}</ref>\n\n===Radio band===\n{{Main|Radio frequency}}\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center; font-size:11px; margin:2px\"\n|- bgcolor= style=\"font-size: smaller;\"\n| colspan=\"8\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''[[Electromagnetic spectrum|Light comparison]]'''\n|-\n!

The power received at the receiving station is usually only a tiny fraction of the transmitter's output, since communication depends on receiving the [[information]], not the [[energy]], that was transmitted.\n\nClassical radio communications systems use [[frequency-division multiplexing]] (FDM) as a strategy to split up and share the available [[radio-frequency]] [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] for use by different parties communications concurrently.  Modern radio communication systems include those that divide up a radio-frequency band by [[time-division multiplexing]] (TDM) and [[code-division multiplexing]] (CDM) as alternatives to the classical FDM strategy.  These systems offer different tradeoffs in supporting multiple users, beyond the FDM strategy that was ideal for broadcast radio but less so for applications such as [[mobile telephony]].\n\nA radio communication system may send information only one way. For example, in broadcasting a single transmitter sends signals to many receivers. Two stations may take turns sending and receiving, using a single radio frequency; this is called \"simplex.\" By using two radio frequencies, two stations may continuously and concurrently send and receive signals - this is called \"[[Duplex (telecommunications)|\nduplex]]\" operation.\n<!-- The defining characteristics of a radio communication system are the amount of information it can send per uit of time ([[Bandwidth (telecommunications)|bandwidth]]), the distance, signal to noise ratio, reliability, operator interface -->\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of radio}}\nIn 1864 [[James Clerk Maxwell]] showed mathematically that electromagnetic waves could propagate through free space.<ref>web.pdx.edu/~bseipel/Lecture%20notes%206-%20203%20EMwaves.pdf</ref> The effects of electromagnetic waves (then-unexplained \"[[action at a distance]]\" sparking behavior) were actually observed before and after Maxwell's work by many inventors and experimenters including [[Luigi Galvani]] (1791), Peter Samuel Munk (1835), [[Joseph Henry]] (1842), Samuel Alfred Varley (1852), [[Edwin Houston]], [[Elihu Thomson]], [[Thomas Edison]] (1875) and [[David Edward Hughes]] (1878).<ref>T.

Bernard Carlson, Innovation as a Social Process: Elihu Thomson and the Rise of General Electric, Cambridge University Press - 2003, pages 57-58</ref> In 1886 [[Heinrich Rudolf Hertz]] noticed the same sparking phenomenon and, in published experiments (1887-1888), was able to demonstrate the existence of electromagnetic waves in an experiment confirming Maxwell's theory of [[electromagnetism]]. The discovery of these \"Hertzian waves\" (radio waves) prompted many experiments by physicists.  An August 1894 lecture by the British physicist [[Oliver Lodge]], where he transmitted and received \"Hertzian waves\" at distances up to 50 meters, was followed up a year later with experiments by Indian physicist [[Jagadish Chandra Bose|Jagadish Bose]] in radio [[microwave]] [[optics]] and construction of a radio based lightning detector by Russian physicist [[Alexander Stepanovich Popov]]. Starting in late 1894, [[Guglielmo Marconi]] began pursuing the idea of building a [[wireless telegraphy]] system based on Hertzian waves (radio). Marconi gained a patent on the system in 1896 and developed it into a commercial communication system over the next few years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&court=us&vol=320&invol=1 |title=U.S. Supreme Court |accessdate=2012-04-23}}</ref>\n\nEarly 20th century radio systems transmitted messages by [[continuous wave]] code only.  Early attempts at developing a system of [[amplitude modulation]] for voice and music were demonstrated in 1900 and 1906, but had little success. [[World War I]] accelerated the development of radio for [[military communications]], and in this era the first [[vacuum tube]]s were applied to radio transmitters and receivers. Electronic amplification was a key development in changing radio from an experimental practice by experts into a home appliance.  After the war, commercial radio broadcasting began in the 1920s and became an important [[mass media|mass medium]] for entertainment and news.\n\n[[World War II]] again accelerated development of radio for the wartime purposes of aircraft and land communication, [[radio navigation]] and [[radar]]. After the war, the experiments in [[television]] that had been interrupted were resumed, and it also became an important home entertainment medium.\n\n==Uses of radio==\n{{broader|Radio spectrum#Applications}}\nEarly uses were maritime, for sending telegraphic messages using [[Morse code]] between ships and land. The earliest users included the Japanese Navy scouting the Russian fleet during the [[Battle of Tsushima]] in 1905. One of the most memorable uses of marine telegraphy was during the sinking of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] in 1912, including communications between operators on the sinking ship and nearby vessels, and communications to shore stations listing the survivors.\n\nRadio was used to pass on orders and communications between armies and navies on both sides in World War I; Germany used radio communications for diplomatic messages once it discovered that its submarine cables had been tapped by the British. The United States passed on President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[Fourteen Points]] to Germany via radio during the war. Broadcasting began from [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], California in 1909,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bayarearadio.org/schneider/kqw.shtml |title=The History Of KQW Radio - KCBS |publisher=Bayarearadio.org |accessdate=2009-07-22}}</ref> and became feasible in the 1920s, with the widespread introduction of radio receivers, particularly in Europe and the United States. Besides broadcasting, point-to-point broadcasting, including telephone messages and relays of radio programs, became widespread in the 1920s and 1930s. Another use of radio in the pre-war years was the development of detection and locating of aircraft and ships by the use of [[radar]] (''RA''dio ''D''etection ''A''nd ''R''anging).\n\nToday, radio takes many forms, including [[wireless network]]s and [[mobile communication]]s of all types, as well as radio broadcasting. Before the advent of [[television]], commercial radio broadcasts included not only news and music, but dramas, comedies, variety shows, and many other forms of entertainment (the era from the late 1920s to the mid-1950s is commonly called radio's \"Golden Age\"). Radio was unique among methods of dramatic presentation in that it used only sound. For more, see [[radio programming]].\n\n===Audio===\n\n====One-way====\n{{main|Radio broadcasting}}\n\n[[File:Bakelite radio.jpg|thumb|Bakelite radio at the Bakelite Museum, Orchard Mill, Williton, Somerset, UK.]]\n[[File:Fisher 500 radio.jpg|thumb|A Fisher 500 AM/FM [[hi-fi]] receiver from 1959.]]\nAM radio uses amplitude modulation, in which the amplitude of the transmitted signal is made proportional to the sound amplitude captured (transduced) by the microphone, while the transmitted frequency remains unchanged. Transmissions are affected by static and interference because lightning and other sources of radio emissions on the same frequency add their amplitudes to the original transmitted amplitude.\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, American AM radio stations broadcast with powers as high as 500&nbsp;kW, and some could be heard worldwide; these stations' transmitters were commandeered for military use by the US Government during World War II. Currently, the maximum broadcast power for a civilian AM radio station in the United States and Canada is 50&nbsp;kW, and the majority of stations that emit signals this powerful were grandfathered in (see [[List of 50 kW AM radio stations in the United States]]). In 1986 [[KTNN]] received the last granted 50,000-watt class A license. These 50&nbsp;kW stations are generally called \"[[Clear-channel station|clear channel]]\" stations (not to be confused with [[Clear Channel Communications]]), because within North America each of these stations has exclusive use of its broadcast frequency throughout part or all of the broadcast day.\n\n[[File:Bush house.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Bush House, London|Bush House]], old home of the [[BBC World Service]].]]\n\nFM broadcast radio sends music and voice with less noise than AM radio. It is often mistakenly thought that FM is higher fidelity than AM, but that is not true. AM is capable of the same audio bandwidth that FM employs. AM receivers typically use narrower filters in the receiver to recover the signal with less noise. AM stereo receivers can reproduce the same audio bandwidth that FM does due to the wider filter used in an AM stereo receiver, but today, AM radios limit the audio bandpass to 3\u20135&nbsp;kHz. In frequency modulation, amplitude variation at the [[microphone]] causes the transmitter frequency to fluctuate. Because the audio signal modulates the frequency and not the amplitude, an FM signal is not subject to static and interference in the same way as AM signals. Due to its need for a wider bandwidth, FM is transmitted in the Very High Frequency (VHF, 30&nbsp;MHz to 300&nbsp;MHz) radio spectrum. <!-- FM requires more radio frequency spectrum than AM and there are more frequencies available at higher frequencies, so there can be more stations, each sending more information. -->\n\nVHF radio waves act more like light, traveling in straight lines; hence the reception range is generally limited to about {{Convert|50|\u2013|200|miles}}. During unusual upper atmospheric conditions, FM signals are occasionally reflected back towards the [[Earth]] by the [[ionosphere]], resulting in [[TV and FM DX|long distance FM reception]]. FM receivers are subject to the [[capture effect]], which causes the radio to only receive the strongest signal when multiple signals appear on the same frequency. FM receivers are relatively immune to lightning and spark interference.\n\nHigh power is useful in penetrating buildings, diffracting around hills, and refracting in the dense atmosphere near the [[horizon]] for some distance beyond the horizon. Consequently, 100,000-watt FM stations can regularly be heard up to {{Convert|100|miles}}  away, and farther, {{Convert|150|miles}}, if there are no competing signals.\n\nA few old, \"grandfathered\" stations do not conform to these power rules. [[WBCT-FM]] (93.7) in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], US, runs 320,000 watts ERP, and can increase to 500,000 watts ERP by the terms of its original license. Such a huge power level does not usually help to increase range as much as one might expect, because VHF frequencies travel in nearly straight lines over the horizon and off into space. Nevertheless, when there were fewer FM stations competing, this station could be heard near Bloomington, Illinois, US, almost {{Convert|300|miles}} away.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n\n[[FM subcarrier]] services are secondary signals transmitted in a \"piggyback\" fashion along with the main program. Special receivers are required to utilize these services. Analog channels may contain alternative programming, such as reading services for the blind, background music or stereo sound signals. In some extremely crowded metropolitan areas, the sub-channel program might be an alternate foreign-language radio program for various ethnic groups. Sub-carriers can also transmit digital data, such as station identification, the current song's name, web addresses, or stock quotes. In some countries, FM radios automatically re-tune themselves to the same channel in a different district by using sub-bands.\n\n====Two-way====\n{{main|Two-way radio}}\n\nAviation voice radios use [[Aircraft band]] VHF AM. AM is used so that multiple stations on the same channel can be received. (Use of FM would result in stronger stations blocking out reception of weaker stations due to FM's [[capture effect]]). Aircraft fly high enough that their transmitters can be received hundreds of miles away, even though they are using VHF.\n[[File:Degen de1103.jpg|thumb|Degen DE1103, an advanced world mini-receiver with single sideband modulation and dual conversion]]\n\nMarine voice radios can use [[single sideband]] voice (SSB) in the shortwave [[High frequency|High Frequency]] (HF\u20143&nbsp;MHz to 30&nbsp;MHz) radio spectrum for very long ranges or [[Marine VHF radio]] / ''narrowband FM'' in the VHF spectrum for much shorter ranges. Narrowband FM sacrifices fidelity to make more channels available within the radio spectrum, by using a smaller range of radio frequencies, usually with five kHz of deviation, versus the 75&nbsp;kHz used by commercial FM broadcasts, and 25&nbsp;kHz used for TV sound.\n\nGovernment, police, fire and commercial voice services also use narrowband FM on special frequencies. Early police radios used AM receivers to receive one-way dispatches.\n\nCivil and military HF (high frequency) voice services use [[shortwave]] radio to contact ships at sea, aircraft and isolated settlements. Most use [[single sideband]] voice (SSB), which uses less bandwidth than AM.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hamuniverse.com/ssbaudio.mp3 |title=Audio example of SSB |date= |accessdate=2014-08-02}}</ref> On an AM radio SSB sounds like ducks quacking, or the adults in a [[Charlie Brown]] cartoon. Viewed as a graph of frequency versus power, an AM signal shows power where the frequencies of the voice add and subtract with the main radio frequency. SSB cuts the bandwidth in half by suppressing the carrier and one of the sidebands. This also makes the transmitter about three times more powerful, because it doesn't need to transmit the unused carrier and sideband.\n\nTETRA, [[Terrestrial Trunked Radio]] is a digital cell phone system for military, police and ambulances. Commercial services such as [[XM Radio|XM]], [[WorldSpace]] and [[Sirius Satellite Radio|Sirius]] offer encrypted digital [[satellite radio]].\n\n===Telephony===\n[[Mobile phone]]s transmit to a local [[cell site]] (transmitter/receiver) that ultimately connects to the public switched telephone network ([[Public switched telephone network|PSTN]]) through an optic fiber or microwave radio and other network elements. When the mobile phone nears the edge of the cell site's radio coverage area, the central computer switches the phone to a new cell. Cell phones originally used FM, but now most{{which?|date=October 2016}} use various{{which?|date=October 2016}} digital modulation schemes. {{Citation Needed|date=October 2016}} Recent developments in Sweden (such as DROPme) allow for the instant downloading of digital material from a radio broadcast (such as a song) to a mobile phone.\n\n[[Satellite phone]]s use satellites rather than cell towers to communicate.\n\n===Video===\nAnalog [[television]] sends the picture as AM and the sound as AM or FM, with the sound carrier a fixed frequency (4.5&nbsp;MHz in the [[NTSC]] system) away from the video carrier. Analog television also uses a [[vestigial sideband]] on the video carrier to reduce the bandwidth required.\n\nDigital television uses [[8VSB]] modulation in North America (under the [[ATSC Standards|ATSC]] digital television standard), and [[Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing|COFDM]] modulation elsewhere in the world (using the [[DVB-T]] standard). A [[Reed\u2013Solomon error correction]] code adds redundant correction codes and allows reliable reception during moderate data loss. Although many current and future codecs can be sent in the [[MPEG transport stream]] [[container format (digital)|container format]], as of 2006 most systems use a standard-definition format almost identical to [[DVD]]: [[MPEG-2]] video in [[Anamorphic widescreen]] and [[MPEG-1 Audio Layer II|MPEG layer 2]] (''MP2'') audio. [[High-definition television]] is possible simply by using a higher-resolution picture, but [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264/AVC]] is being considered as a replacement video codec in some regions for its improved compression. With the compression and improved modulation involved, a single \"channel\" can contain a high-definition program and several standard-definition programs.\n\n===Navigation===\n{{main|Radio navigation}}\n\nAll [[satellite navigation]] systems use satellites with precision clocks. The satellite transmits its position, and the time of the transmission. The receiver listens to four satellites, and can figure its position as being on a line that is tangent to a spherical shell around each satellite, determined by the [[time-of-flight]] of the radio signals from the satellite. A [[computer]] in the receiver does the math.\n\n[[Radio direction finder|Radio direction-finding]] is the oldest form of radio navigation. Before 1960 navigators used movable loop antennas to locate commercial AM stations near cities. In some cases they used marine radiolocation beacons, which share a range of frequencies just above AM radio with amateur radio operators. [[LORAN]] systems also used time-of-flight radio signals, but from radio stations on the ground.\n\n[[VHF omnidirectional range|Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range]] (VOR), systems (used by aircraft), have an antenna array that transmits two signals simultaneously. A directional signal rotates like a lighthouse at a fixed rate. When the directional signal is facing north, an omnidirectional signal pulses. By measuring the difference in phase of these two signals, an aircraft can determine its bearing or radial from the station, thus establishing a line of position. An aircraft can get readings from two VORs and locate its position at the intersection of the two radials, known as a \"[[Position fixing|fix]].\"\n\nWhen the VOR station is collocated with DME ([[Distance measuring equipment|Distance Measuring Equipment]]), the aircraft can determine its bearing and range from the station, thus providing a fix from only one ground station. Such stations are called VOR/DMEs. The military operates a similar system of navaids, called [[TACAN]]s, which are often built into VOR stations. Such stations are called [[VORTAC]]s. Because TACANs include distance measuring equipment, VOR/DME and VORTAC stations are identical in navigation potential to civil aircraft.\n\n===Radar===\n{{main|Radar}}\nRadar (Radio Detection And Ranging) detects objects at a distance by bouncing radio waves off them. The delay caused by the echo measures the distance. The direction of the beam determines the direction of the reflection. The polarization and frequency of the return can sense the type of surface. Navigational radars scan a wide area two to four times per minute. They use very short waves that reflect from earth and stone. They are common on commercial ships and long-distance commercial aircraft.\n\nGeneral purpose radars generally use navigational radar frequencies, but modulate and polarize the pulse so the receiver can determine the type of surface of the reflector. The best general-purpose radars distinguish the rain of heavy storms, as well as land and vehicles. Some can superimpose sonar data and map data from [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] position.\n\nSearch radars scan a wide area with pulses of short radio waves. They usually scan the area two to four times a minute. Sometimes search radars use the [[Doppler effect]] to separate moving vehicles from clutter. Targeting radars use the same principle as search radar but scan a much smaller area far more often, usually several times a second or more. Weather radars resemble search radars, but use radio waves with circular polarization and a wavelength to reflect from water droplets. Some weather radar use the Doppler effect to measure wind speeds.\n\n===Data (digital radio)===\n[[File:Radio DAB.JPG|thumb|2008 Pure One Classic digital radio]]\n\nMost new radio systems are digital, including [[Digital television|Digital TV]], satellite radio, and [[Digital Audio Broadcasting]]. The oldest form of digital broadcast was spark gap [[telegraphy]], used by pioneers such as Marconi. By pressing the key, the operator could send messages in [[Morse code]] by energizing a rotating commutating spark gap. The rotating commutator produced a tone in the receiver, where a simple spark gap would produce a [[Background radiation|hiss]], indistinguishable from static. [[Spark-gap transmitter]]s are now illegal, because their transmissions span several hundred megahertz. This is very wasteful of both radio frequencies and power.\n\nThe next advance was continuous wave [[telegraphy]], or CW ([[Continuous wave|Continuous Wave]]), in which a pure radio frequency, produced by a [[vacuum tube]] [[electronic oscillator]] was switched on and off by a key. A receiver with a local oscillator would \"[[heterodyne]]\" with the pure radio frequency, creating a whistle-like audio tone. CW uses less than 100&nbsp;Hz of bandwidth. CW is still used, these days primarily by amateur radio operators (hams). Strictly, on-off keying of a carrier should be known as \"Interrupted Continuous Wave\" or ICW or [[on-off keying]] (OOK).\n\n[[Radioteletype]] equipment usually operates on short-wave (HF) and is much loved by the military because they create written information without a skilled operator. They send a bit as one of two tones using [[frequency-shift keying]]. Groups of five or seven bits become a character printed by a teleprinter. From about 1925 to 1975, radioteletype was how most commercial messages were sent to less developed countries. These are still used by the military and weather services.\n\nAircraft use a 1200 Baud radioteletype service over VHF to send their ID, altitude and position, and get gate and connecting-flight data. Microwave dishes on satellites, telephone exchanges and TV stations usually use [[quadrature amplitude modulation]] (QAM). QAM sends data by changing both the phase and the amplitude of the radio signal. Engineers like QAM because it packs the most bits into a radio signal when given an exclusive (non-shared) fixed narrowband frequency range. Usually the bits are sent in \"frames\" that repeat. A special bit pattern is used to locate the beginning of a frame.\n[[File:GPS Receivers.jpg|thumb|right|Modern [[GPS]] receivers.]]\nCommunication systems that limit themselves to a fixed narrowband frequency range are vulnerable to [[Radio jamming|jamming]]. A variety of jamming-resistant [[spread spectrum]] techniques were initially developed for military use, most famously for [[Global Positioning System]] satellite transmissions. Commercial use of spread spectrum began in the 1980s. [[Bluetooth]], most cell phones, and the 802.11b version of Wi-Fi each use various forms of spread spectrum.\n\nSystems that need reliability, or that share their frequency with other services, may use \"coded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing\" or [[Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing|COFDM]]. COFDM breaks a digital signal into as many as several hundred slower subchannels. The digital signal is often sent as QAM on the subchannels. Modern COFDM systems use a small computer to make and decode the signal with [[digital signal processing]], which is more flexible and far less expensive than older systems that implemented separate electronic channels.\n\nCOFDM resists [[fading]] and [[Ghosting (television)|ghosting]] because the narrow-channel QAM signals can be sent slowly. An adaptive system, or one that sends error-correction codes can also resist interference, because most interference can affect only a few of the QAM channels. COFDM is used for Wi-Fi, some cell phones, [[Digital Radio Mondiale]], [[Eureka 147]], and many other local area network, digital TV and radio standards.\n\n===Heating===\n{{main|Radio-frequency heating}}\nRadio-frequency energy generated for heating of objects is generally not intended to radiate outside of the generating equipment, to prevent interference with other radio signals. [[Microwave oven]]s use intense radio waves to heat food. [[Dielectric heating|Diathermy]] equipment is used in surgery for sealing of blood vessels. Induction [[furnace]]s are used for melting metal for [[casting]], and [[induction hob]]s for cooking.\n\n===Amateur radio service===\n[[File:NX1Z Radio.jpg|thumb|[[Amateur radio station]] with multiple receivers and transceivers]]\n[[Amateur radio]], also known as \"ham radio\", is a [[hobby]] in which enthusiasts are licensed to communicate on a number of bands in the [[radio frequency spectrum]] non-commercially and for their own experiments. They may also provide emergency and service assistance in exceptional circumstances. This contribution has been very beneficial in saving lives in many instances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arrl.org/news/stories/2004/12/29/100/?nc=1 |title=''Amateur Radio \"Saved Lives\" in South Asia'' |publisher=Arrl.org |date=2004-12-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013184249/http://www.arrl.org/news/stories/2004/12/29/100/?nc=1 |archivedate=2007-10-13}}</ref>\n\nRadio amateurs use a variety of modes, including efficient ones like [[Morse code]] and experimental ones like [[Lowfer|Low-Frequency Experimental Radio]]. Several forms of radio were pioneered by radio amateurs and later became commercially important, including FM, [[Single sideband|single-sideband]] (SSB), AM, digital packet radio and [[amateur radio satellite|satellite repeaters]]. Some amateur frequencies may be disrupted illegally by [[Power line communication|power-line internet service]].\n\n===Unlicensed radio services===\nUnlicensed, government-authorized personal radio services such as [[Citizens' band radio]] in Australia, most of the Americas, and Europe, and [[Family Radio Service]] and [[Multi-Use Radio Service]] in North America exist to provide simple, usually short range communication for individuals and small groups, without the overhead of licensing. Similar services exist in other parts of the world. These radio services involve the use of handheld units.\n\nWi-Fi also operates in unlicensed radio bands and is very widely used to network computers.\n\nFree radio stations, sometimes called [[pirate radio]] or \"clandestine\" stations, are unauthorized, unlicensed, illegal broadcasting stations. These are often low power transmitters operated on sporadic schedules by hobbyists, community activists, or political and cultural dissidents. Some pirate stations operating offshore in parts of Europe and the United Kingdom more closely resembled legal stations, maintaining regular schedules, using high power, and selling commercial advertising time.<ref>''Free radio: electronic civil disobedience'' by Lawrence C.

Large industrial remote-controlled equipment such as [[crane (machine)|cranes]] and switching [[locomotive]]s now usually use digital radio techniques to ensure safety and reliability.\n\nIn [[Madison Square Garden]], at the Electrical Exhibition of 1898, [[Nikola Tesla]] successfully demonstrated a radio-controlled boat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/tesla/ins/lab_remotec.html |title=Tesla - Master of Lightning: Remote Control |publisher=PBS |accessdate=2009-07-22}}</ref> He was awarded U.S. patent No. 613,809 for a \"Method of and Apparatus for Controlling Mechanism of Moving Vessels or Vehicles.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/tesla/res/613809.html |title=Tesla - Master of Lightning: Selected Tesla Patents |publisher=PBS |accessdate=2009-07-22}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Radio}}\n*[[Outline of radio]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist\n| group = n\n| colwidth = 40em\n| refs =\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links==\n{{Commons+cat|Radio|Radio}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n\n{{Morse code}}\n{{Telecommunications}}\n{{Audio broadcasting}}\n{{Radio spectrum}}\n{{Media culture}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Radio| ]]\n[[Category:British inventions]]\n[[Category:Italian inventions]]\n[[Category:Media formats]]"}]}}}}
