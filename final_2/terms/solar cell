Solar cells are the building blocks of photovoltaic modules, otherwise known as [[solar panel]]s.\n\nSolar cells are described as being [[photovoltaic]] irrespective of whether the source is [[sunlight]] or an artificial light. They are used as a [[photodetector]] (for example [[infrared detector]]s), detecting light or other [[electromagnetic radiation]] near the visible range, or measuring light intensity.\n\nThe operation of a photovoltaic (PV) cell requires 3 basic attributes:\n\n* The absorption of light, generating either [[electron]]-[[Electron hole|hole]] pairs or [[excitons]].\n* The separation of charge carriers of opposite types.\n* The separate extraction of those carriers to an external circuit.\n\nIn contrast, a [[solar thermal collector]] supplies heat by absorbing sunlight, for the purpose of either direct heating or indirect electrical power generation from heat. A \"photoelectrolytic cell\" ([[photoelectrochemical cell]]), on the other hand, refers either to a type of photovoltaic cell (like that developed by [[Edmond Becquerel]] and modern [[dye-sensitized solar cells]]), or to a device that splits water directly into hydrogen and oxygen using only solar illumination.\n\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n== Applications ==\n[[File:From a solar cell to a PV system.svg|thumb|From a solar cell to a PV system. Diagram of the possible components of a [[photovoltaic system]]]]\n\nAssemblies of solar cells are used to make [[solar module]]s which generate electrical power from [[sunlight]], as distinguished from a \"solar thermal module\" or \"solar hot water panel\". A solar array generates [[solar power]] using [[solar energy]].\n\n=== Cells, modules, panels and systems ===\n{{Main article|Photovoltaic system}}\n\nMultiple solar cells in an integrated group, all oriented in one plane, constitute a solar photovoltaic panel or solar photovoltaic module. Photovoltaic modules often have a sheet of glass on the sun-facing side, allowing light to pass while protecting the semiconductor [[Wafer (electronics)|wafers]]. Solar cells are usually connected in [[series and parallel circuits or series]] in modules, creating an additive voltage. Connecting cells in parallel yields a higher current; however, problems such as shadow effects can shut down the weaker (less illuminated) parallel string (a number of series connected cells) causing substantial power loss and possible damage because of the reverse bias applied to the shadowed cells by their illuminated partners. Strings of series cells are usually handled independently and not connected in parallel, though as of 2014, individual [[Electric power conversion|power boxes]] are often supplied for each module, and are connected in parallel. Although modules can be interconnected to create an array with the desired peak DC voltage and loading current capacity, using independent MPPTs ([[Maximum power point tracking|maximum power point trackers]]) is preferable. Otherwise, shunt [[diode]]s can reduce shadowing power loss in arrays with series/parallel connected cells.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; margin: 4px auto 1px auto;\"\n|+ Typical PV system prices in 2013 in selected countries (USD)\n|-\n!

[[Willoughby Smith]] first described the \"Effect of Light on Selenium during the passage of an Electric Current\" in a 20 February 1873 issue of [[Nature (magazine)|Nature]]. In 1883 [[Charles Fritts]] built the first [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] photovoltaic cell by coating the [[semiconductor]] [[selenium]] with a thin layer of [[gold]] to form the junctions; the device was only around 1% efficient.\n\nIn 1888 Russian physicist [[Aleksandr Stoletov]] built the first cell based on the outer [[photoelectric effect]] discovered by [[Heinrich Hertz]] in 1887.<ref name=\"Gevorkian2007\">{{cite book|last=Gevorkian |first=Peter |title=Sustainable energy systems engineering: the complete green building design resource|url={{google books|id=i8rcHsOfPScC|p=498|plainurl=y}}|year=2007|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-147359-0}}</ref>\n\nIn 1905 [[Albert Einstein]] proposed a new quantum theory of light and explained the [[photoelectric effect]] in a landmark paper, for which he received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1921.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/ \"The Nobel Prize in Physics 1921: Albert Einstein\"], Nobel Prize official page</ref>\n\n[[Vadim Lashkaryov]] discovered ''p''-''n''-junctions in Cu<math>_2</math>O and silver sulphide protocells in 1941.<cite><ref>Lashkaryov, V.

By adding cells to the outside of the body, the mission time could be extended with no major changes to the spacecraft or its power systems. In 1959 the United States launched [[Explorer 6]], featuring large wing-shaped solar arrays, which became a common feature in satellites. These arrays consisted of 9600 [[H. Leslie (Les) Hoffman|Hoffman solar cells]].\n\nBy the 1960s, solar cells were (and still are) the main power source for most Earth orbiting satellites and a number of probes into the solar system, since they offered the best [[power-to-weight ratio]]. However, this success was possible because in the space application, power system costs could be high, because space users had few other power options, and were willing to pay for the best possible cells. The space power market drove the development of higher efficiencies in solar cells up until the [[National Science Foundation]] \"Research Applied to National Needs\" program began to push development of solar cells for terrestrial applications.\n\nIn the early 1990s the technology used for space solar cells diverged from the silicon technology used for terrestrial panels, with the spacecraft application shifting to [[gallium arsenide]]-based III-V semiconductor materials, which then evolved into the modern III-V [[multijunction photovoltaic cell]] used on spacecraft.\n\n=== Price reductions ===\n\nImprovements were gradual over the 1960s. This was also the reason that costs remained high, because space users were willing to pay for the best possible cells, leaving no reason to invest in lower-cost, less-efficient solutions. The price was determined largely by the semiconductor industry; their move to [[integrated circuit]]s in the 1960s led to the availability of larger [[Boule (crystal)|boules]] at lower relative prices. As their price fell, the price of the resulting cells did as well. These effects lowered 1971 cell costs to some $100 per watt.{{sfn|Perlin|1999|p= 50}}\n\nIn late 1969 Elliot Berman joined [[Exxon]]'s task force which was looking for projects 30 years in the future and in April 1973 he founded Solar Power Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Exxon at that time.{{sfn|Perlin|1999|p=53}}<ref name=\"williams 2005\">\n{{cite book\n | first = Neville | last = Williams\n | title = Chasing the Sun: Solar Adventures Around the World\n | year = 2005\n | publisher = [[New Society Publishers]]\n | page = 84\n | isbn = 9781550923124}}\n</ref><ref name=jones>\n{{cite book\n | first1 = Geoffrey | last1 = Jones\n  | first2 = Loubna | last2 = Bouamane \n | title = \"Power from Sunshine\": A Business History of Solar Energy  \n | url = http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/12-105.pdf\n | year = 2012\n | publisher = [[Harvard Business School]]\n | pages = 22\u201323\n | format = PDF}}\n</ref>  The group had concluded that electrical power would be much more expensive by 2000, and felt that this increase in price would make alternative energy sources more attractive.

Cell sizes grew as equipment became available on the surplus market; ARCO Solar's original panels used cells {{convert|2|to|4|in|mm|-1}} in diameter. Panels in the 1990s and early 2000s generally used 125&nbsp;mm wafers; since 2008 almost all new panels use 156&nbsp;mm cells. The widespread introduction of [[flat screen television]]s in the late 1990s and early 2000s led to the wide availability of large, high-quality glass sheets to cover the panels.\n\nDuring the 1990s, [[polysilicon]] (\"poly\") cells became increasingly popular.

Once excited an electron can either dissipate the energy as heat and return to its orbital or travel through the cell until it reaches an electrode. Current flows through the material to cancel the potential and this electricity is captured. The [[chemical bonds]] of the material are vital for this process to work, and usually [[silicon]] is used in two layers, one layer being bonded with [[boron]], the other [[phosphorus]].   These layers have different chemical electric charges and subsequently both drive and direct the current of electrons.<ref name=\"chemistryexplained.com\"/>\n* An array of solar cells converts solar energy into a usable amount of [[direct current]] (DC) electricity.\n* An [[inverter]] can convert the power to [[alternating current]] (AC).\n\nThe most commonly known solar cell is configured as a large-area [[p\u2013n junction]] made from silicon.\n\n== Efficiency ==\n\n[[File:ShockleyQueisserFullCurve.svg|thumb|The [[Shockley-Queisser limit]] for the theoretical maximum efficiency of a solar cell.

(The efficiency \"limit\" shown here can be exceeded by [[multijunction solar cell]]s.)]]\n\n{{Main article|Solar cell efficiency}}\n\nSolar cell efficiency may be broken down into reflectance efficiency, thermodynamic efficiency, charge carrier separation efficiency and conductive efficiency. The overall efficiency is the product of these individual metrics.\n\nA solar cell has a voltage dependent efficiency curve, temperature coefficients, and allowable shadow angles.\n\nDue to the difficulty in measuring these parameters directly, other parameters are substituted: thermodynamic efficiency, [[Quantum efficiency of a solar cell|quantum efficiency]], [[Quantum efficiency|integrated quantum efficiency]], V<sub>OC</sub> ratio, and fill factor. Reflectance losses are a portion of quantum efficiency under \"external quantum efficiency\". Recombination losses make up another portion of quantum efficiency, V<sub>OC</sub> ratio, and fill factor. Resistive losses are predominantly categorized under fill factor, but also make up minor portions of quantum efficiency, V<sub>OC</sub> ratio.\n\nThe fill factor is the ratio of the actual maximum obtainable [[power (physics)|power]] to the product of the [[open circuit voltage]] and [[short circuit current]].

These [[List of semiconductor materials|materials]] must have certain characteristics in order to absorb [[sunlight]]. Some cells are designed to handle sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface, while others are optimized for [[Solar panels on spacecraft|use in space]]. Solar cells can be made of only one single layer of light-absorbing material ([[p-n junction|single-junction]]) or use multiple physical configurations ([[multi-junction]]s) to take advantage of various absorption and charge separation mechanisms.\n\nSolar cells can be classified into first, second and third generation cells. The first generation cells\u2014also called conventional, traditional or [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]]-based cells\u2014are made of [[crystalline silicon]], the commercially predominant PV technology, that includes materials such as [[polysilicon]] and [[monocrystalline silicon]]. Second generation cells are [[thin film solar cells]], that include [[amorphous silicon]], [[Cadmium telluride photovoltaics|CdTe]] and [[Copper indium gallium selenide solar cell|CIGS]] cells and are commercially significant in utility-scale [[photovoltaic power station]]s, [[building integrated photovoltaics]] or in small [[stand-alone power system]]. The third generation of solar cells includes a number of thin-film technologies often described as emerging photovoltaics\u2014most of them have not yet been commercially applied and are still in the research or development phase. Many use organic materials, often [[organometallic]] compounds as well as inorganic substances. Despite the fact that their efficiencies had been low and the stability of the absorber material was often too short for commercial applications, there is a lot of research invested into these technologies as they promise to achieve the goal of producing low-cost, high-efficiency solar cells.\n\n=== Crystalline silicon ===\n\n{{Main article|Crystalline silicon}}\n\nBy far, the most prevalent bulk material for solar cells is [[crystalline silicon]] (c-Si), also known as \"solar grade silicon\". Bulk silicon is separated into multiple categories according to crystallinity and crystal size in the resulting [[ingot]], [[ribbon]] or [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]]. These cells are entirely based around the concept of a [[p-n junction]].\nSolar cells made of c-Si are made from [[wafer (electronics)|wafers]] between 160 and 240&nbsp;[[micrometers]] thick.\n\n==== Monocrystalline silicon ====\n\n{{Main article|Monocrystalline silicon}}\n\n: [[Monocrystalline silicon]] (mono-Si) solar cells are more efficient and more expensive than most other types of cells. The corners of the cells look clipped, like an octagon, because the wafer material is cut from cylindrical ingots, that are typically grown by the [[Czochralski process]]. Solar panels using mono-Si cells display a distinctive pattern of small white diamonds.\n\n====Epitaxial silicon====\n\n[[Epitaxial wafer]]s can be grown on a monocrystalline silicon \"seed\" wafer by atmospheric-pressure CVD in a  high-throughput inline process, and then detached as self-supporting wafers of some standard thickness (e.g., 250&nbsp;\u00b5m) that can be manipulated by hand, and directly substituted for wafer cells cut from monocrystalline silicon ingots.  Solar cells made with this technique can have efficiencies approaching those of wafer-cut cells, but at appreciably lower cost.<ref name=EpiWafer>{{cite news| url=http://www.davidpublishing.com/DownLoad/?id=17644| title=Epitaxial n- and p-type Emitters for High Efficiency Solar Cell Concepts| first1=Thomas| last1=Rachow| first2=Friedemann| last2=Heinz| first3=Bernd| last3=Steinhauser| first4=Stefan| last4=Janz| first5=Stefan| last5=Reber| publisher=[[David Publishing]]| journal=[[Journal of Energy and Power Engineering]]| year=2014| volume=8| pages=1371\u20131377| accessdate=October 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==== Polycrystalline silicon ====\n\n{{Main article|Polycrystalline silicon}}\n\n: [[Polycrystalline silicon]], or multicrystalline silicon (multi-Si) cells are made from cast square ingots\u2014large blocks of molten silicon carefully cooled and solidified. They consist of small crystals giving the material its typical [[Crystallite|metal flake effect]]. Polysilicon cells are the most common type used in photovoltaics and are less expensive, but also less efficient, than those made from monocrystalline silicon.\n\n==== Ribbon silicon ====\n\n: [[Ribbon silicon]] is a type of polycrystalline silicon\u2014it is formed by drawing flat thin films from [[molten]] silicon and results in a polycrystalline structure. These cells are cheaper to make than multi-Si, due to a great reduction in silicon waste, as this approach does not require [[saw]]ing from [[ingot]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ece.gatech.edu/research/UCEP/papers/3world/STRING%20RIBBON%20SILICON%20SOLAR%20CELLS%20WITH%2017.8%25%20EFFICIENCY.pdf|title=String ribbon silicon solar cells with 17.8% efficiency|author=Kim, D.S.|journal=Proceedings of 3rd World Conference on Photovoltaic Energy Conversion, 2003|date=18 May 2003|pages= 1293\u20131296|volume=2|isbn=4-9901816-0-3\n|display-authors=etal}}</ref> However, they are also less efficient.\n\n==== Mono-like-multi silicon (MLM) ====\n\n: This form was developed in the 2000s and introduced commercially around 2009. Also called cast-mono, this design uses polycrystalline casting chambers with small \"seeds\" of mono material. The result is a bulk mono-like material that is polycrystalline around the outsides. When sliced for processing, the inner sections are high-efficiency mono-like cells (but square instead of \"clipped\"), while the outer edges are sold as conventional poly. This production method results in mono-like cells at poly-like prices.<ref>Wayne McMillan, [http://btimaging.com/Downloads/bt_PV_eng-Advertorial3_Final.pdf \"The Cast Mono Dilemma\"], BT Imaging</ref>\n\n=== Thin film ===\n\n{{Main article|Thin-film solar cell}}\n\nThin-film technologies reduce the amount of active material in a cell.

An amorphous silicon (a-Si) solar cell is made of non-crystalline or microcrystalline silicon. Amorphous silicon has a higher bandgap (1.7&nbsp;eV) than crystalline silicon (c-Si) (1.1&nbsp;eV), which means it absorbs the visible part of the solar spectrum more strongly than the higher power density [[infrared]] portion of the spectrum. The production of a-Si thin film solar cells uses glass as a substrate and deposits a very thin layer of silicon by [[plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition]] (PECVD).\n\n: Protocrystalline silicon with a low volume fraction of nanocrystalline silicon is optimal for high open circuit voltage.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.2714507| title = Optimization of open circuit voltage in amorphous silicon solar cells with mixed-phase (amorphous+nanocrystalline) p-type contacts of low nanocrystalline content| journal = Journal of Applied Physics| volume = 101| issue = 11| page = 114301| year = 2007| last1 = Pearce | first1 = J.

Most commonly, this is a solution-processed hybrid organic-inorganic tin or lead halide based material.

Either of these techniques could be used to produce higher efficiency solar cells by allowing solar photons to be more efficiently used. The difficulty, however, is that the conversion efficiency of existing [[phosphor]]s exhibiting up- or down-conversion is low, and is typically narrow band.\n\nOne upconversion technique is to incorporate [[lanthanide]]-doped materials ([[Erbium|{{chem|Er|3+}}]], [[Ytterbium|{{chem|Yb|3+}}]], [[Holmium|{{chem|Ho|3+}}]] or a combination), taking advantage of their [[luminescence]] to convert [[infrared radiation]] to visible light. Upconversion process occurs when two [[infrared]] photons are absorbed by [[rare-earth]] [[ion]]s to generate a (high-energy) absorbable photon. As example, the energy transfer upconversion process (ETU), consists in successive transfer processes between excited ions in the near infrared. The upconverter material could be placed below the solar cell to absorb the infrared light that passes through the silicon. Useful ions are most commonly found in the trivalent state. {{chem|Er|+}} ions have been the most used. {{chem|Er|3+}} ions absorb solar radiation around 1.54&nbsp;\u00b5m. Two {{chem|Er|3+}} ions that have absorbed this radiation can interact with each other through an upconversion process. The excited ion emits light above the Si bandgap that is absorbed by the solar cell and creates an additional electron\u2013hole pair that can generate current. However, the increased efficiency was small. In addition, fluoroindate glasses have low [[phonon]] energy and have been proposed as suitable matrix doped with {{chem|Ho|3+}} ions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hern\u00e1ndez-Rodr\u00edguez|first=M.A.|author2=Imanieh, M.H. |author3=Mart\u00edn, L.L. |author4= Mart\u00edn, I.R. |title=Experimental enhancement of the photocurrent in a solar cell using upconversion process in fluoroindate glasses exciting at 1480nm|journal=Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells|date=September 2013|volume=116|pages=171\u2013175|doi=10.1016/j.solmat.2013.04.023}}</ref>\n\n=== Light-absorbing dyes ===\n\n{{Main article|Dye-sensitized solar cell|l1=Dye-sensitized solar cells}}\n\n[[Dye-sensitized solar cell]]s (DSSCs) are made of low-cost materials and do not need elaborate manufacturing equipment, so they can be made in a [[Do it yourself|DIY]] fashion. In bulk it should be significantly less expensive than older [[Solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] cell designs. DSSC's can be engineered into flexible sheets and although its [[conversion efficiency]] is less than the best [[thin film cell]]s, its [[price/performance ratio]] may be high enough to allow them to compete with [[fossil fuel electrical generation]].\n\nTypically a [[ruthenium]] [[Metalorganics|metalorganic]] [[dye]] (Ru-centered) is used as a [[monolayer]] of light-absorbing material. The dye-sensitized solar cell depends on a [[mesoporous]] layer of [[nanoparticulate]] [[titanium dioxide]] to greatly amplify the surface area (200\u2013300 m<sup>2</sup>/g {{chem|TiO|2}}, as compared to approximately 10 m<sup>2</sup>/g of flat single crystal). The photogenerated electrons from the light absorbing dye are passed on to the n-type {{chem|TiO|2}} and the holes are absorbed by an [[electrolyte]] on the other side of the dye. The circuit is completed by a [[redox]] couple in the electrolyte, which can be liquid or solid. This type of cell allows more flexible use of materials and is typically manufactured by [[screen printing]] or [[ultrasonic nozzle]]s, with the potential for lower processing costs than those used for bulk solar cells. However, the dyes in these cells also suffer from [[chemical decomposition|degradation]] under heat and [[UV]] light and the cell casing is difficult to [[Seal (mechanical)|seal]] due to the solvents used in assembly.

In addition, these cells could be beneficial for some applications where mechanical flexibility and disposability are important. Current cell efficiencies are, however, very low, and practical devices are essentially non-existent.\n\nEnergy conversion efficiencies achieved to date using conductive polymers are very low compared to inorganic materials. However, [[Konarka]] Power Plastic reached efficiency of 8.3%<ref>[http://www.pv-tech.org/news/nrel_validates_konarkas_8.3_power_plastic_efficiency_record Konarka Power Plastic reaches 8.3% efficiency]. pv-tech.org.

When a photon is converted into an electron hole pair, typically in the donor material, the charges tend to remain bound in the form of an [[exciton]], separating when the exciton diffuses to the donor-acceptor interface, unlike most other solar cell types. The short exciton diffusion lengths of most polymer systems tend to limit the efficiency of such devices. Nanostructured interfaces, sometimes in the form of bulk heterojunctions, can improve performance.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S1369-7021(07)70276-6| title = Polymer-based solar cells| journal = Materials Today| volume = 10| issue = 11| page = 28| year = 2007| last1 = Mayer | first1 = A. | last2 = Scully | first2 = S. | last3 = Hardin | first3 = B. | last4 = Rowell | first4 = M. | last5 = McGehee | first5 = M. }}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, MIT and Michigan State researchers developed solar cells with a power efficiency close to 2% with a transparency to the human eye greater than 65%, achieved by selectively absorbing the ultraviolet and near-infrared parts of the spectrum with small-molecule compounds.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.3567516| title = Transparent, near-infrared organic photovoltaic solar cells for window and energy-scavenging applications| journal = Applied Physics Letters| volume = 98| issue = 11| page = 113305| year = 2011| last1 = Lunt | first1 = R.

An adaptive material responds to the intensity and angle of incident light. At the part of the cell where the light is most intense, the cell surface changes from reflective to adaptive, allowing the light to penetrate the cell. The other parts of the cell remain reflective increasing the retention of the absorbed light within the cell.<ref name=tr1407>Bullis, Kevin (July 30, 2014)  [http://www.technologyreview.com/news/529476/adaptive-material-could-cut-the-cost-of-solar-in-half Adaptive Material Could Cut the Cost of Solar in Half]. ''MIT Technology Review''</ref>\n\nIn 2014 a system that combined an adaptive surface with a glass substrate that redirect the absorbed to a light absorber on the edges of the sheet. The system also included an array of fixed lenses/mirrors to concentrate light onto the adaptive surface. As the day continues, the concentrated light moves along the surface of the cell. That surface switches from reflective to adaptive when the light is most concentrated and back to reflective after the light moves along.<ref name=tr1407/>\n\n=== Surface Texturing ===\n\nFor the past years, researchers have been trying to reduce the price of solar cells while maximizing efficiency. [[Thin-film solar cell]] is a cost-effective second generation solar cell with much reduced thickness at the expense of light absorption efficiency. Efforts to maximize light absorption efficiency with reduced thickness have been made. Surface texturing is one of techniques used to reduce optical losses to maximize light absorbed. Currently, surface texturing techniques on silicon photovoltaics are drawing much attention. Surface texturing could be done in multiple ways. Etching single crystalline silicon substrate can produce randomly distributed square based pyramids on the surface using anisotropic etchants.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Patrick|author2=Green, Martin A. |title=Light Trapping Properties of Pyramidally textured surfaces|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|date=Feb 1987|volume=62| pages=243\u2013249|doi=10.1063/1.339189}}</ref> Recent studies show that c-Si wafers could be etched down to form nano-scale inverted pyramids. Multicrystalline silicon solar cells, due to poorer crystallographic quality, are less effective than single crystal solar cells, but mc-Si solar cells are still being used widely due to less manufacturing difficulties. It is reported that multicrystalline solar cells can be surface-textured to yield solar energy conversion efficiency comparable to that of monocrystalline silicon cells, through isotropic etching or photolithography techniques.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Zhao|first=Jianhua|author2=Wang, Aihua |author3=Green, Martin A.|title=19.8% efficient \"honeycomb\" textured multicrystalline and 24.4% monocrystalline silicon solar cells|journal=Applied Physics Letters|date=May 1998|volume=73|issue=14| pages=1991\u20131993|doi=10.1063/1.122345}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Hauser|first=H.|author2=Michl, B.|author3=Kubler, V.|author4= Schwarzkopf, S.|author5= Muller, C.|author6= Hermle, M.|author7= Blasi, B.|title=Nanoimprint Lithography for Honeycomb Texturing of Multicrystalline Silicon|journal=Energy Procedia|date=2011|volume=8|pages=648\u2013653|doi=10.1016/j.egypro.2011.06.196}}</ref> Incident light rays onto a textured surface do not reflect back out to the air as opposed to rays onto a flat surface. Rather some light rays are bounced back onto the other surface again due to the geometry of the surface. This process significantly improves light to electricity conversion efficiency, due to increased light absorption. In 2012, researchers at MIT reported that c-Si films textured with nanoscale inverted pyramids could achieve light absorption comparable to 30 times thicker planar c-Si.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mavrokefalos|first=Anastassios|author2=Han, Sang Eon. |author3=Yerci, Selcuk |author4= Branham, M.S.|author5= Chen, Gang. |title=Efficient Light Trapping in Inverted Nanopyramid Thin Crystalline Silicon Membranes for Solar Cell Applications|journal=Nano Letters|date=June 2012|volume=12|issue=6| pages=2792\u20132796|doi=10.1021/nl2045777}}</ref> In combination with [[anti-reflective coating]], surface texturing technique can effectively trap light rays within a thin film silicon solar cell. Consequently, required thickness for solar cells decreases with the increased absorption of light rays.\n\n== Manufacture ==\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2014}}\n[[File:FX-77.JPG|thumb|upright|Early [[solar-powered calculator]]]]\n\nSolar cells share some of the same processing and manufacturing techniques as other semiconductor devices. However, the stringent requirements for cleanliness and quality control of semiconductor fabrication are more relaxed for solar cells, lowering costs.\n\n[[Polycrystalline silicon]] wafers are made by wire-sawing block-cast silicon ingots into 180 to 350 micrometer wafers. The wafers are usually lightly [[p-type semiconductor|p-type]]-doped. A surface diffusion of [[n-type semiconductor|n-type]] dopants is performed on the front side of the wafer. This forms a p\u2013n junction a few hundred nanometers below the surface.\n\n[[Anti-reflective coating|Anti-reflection coatings]] are then typically applied to increase the amount of light coupled into the solar cell. [[Silicon nitride]] has gradually replaced titanium dioxide as the preferred material, because of its excellent surface passivation qualities. It prevents carrier recombination at the cell surface. A layer several hundred nanometers thick is applied using PECVD. Some solar cells have textured front surfaces that, like anti-reflection coatings, increase the amount of light reaching the wafer. Such surfaces were first applied to single-crystal silicon, followed by multicrystalline silicon somewhat later.\n\nA full area metal contact is made on the back surface, and a grid-like metal contact made up of fine \"fingers\" and larger \"bus bars\" are screen-printed onto the front surface using a [[silver]] paste. This is an evolution of the so-called \"wet\" process for applying electrodes, first described in a US patent filed in 1981 by [[Bayer AG]].<ref>Fitzky, Hans G. and Ebneth, Harold (May 24, 1983) {{US Patent|4385102}}, \"Large-area photovoltaic cell\"</ref> The rear contact is formed by screen-printing a metal paste, typically aluminium. Usually this contact covers the entire rear, though some designs employ a grid pattern. The paste is then fired at several hundred degrees Celsius to form metal electrodes in [[ohmic contact]] with the silicon. Some companies use an additional electro-plating step to increase efficiency. After the metal contacts are made, the solar cells are interconnected by flat wires or metal ribbons, and assembled into [[photovoltaic module|modules]] or \"solar panels\". Solar panels have a sheet of [[tempered glass]] on the front, and a [[polymer]] encapsulation on the back.\n\n== Manufacturers and certification ==\n\n{{further information|List of photovoltaics companies}}\n\n[[File:SolarCellProduction-E.PNG|thumb|right|190px|Solar cell production by region<ref name=\"pvnews\">[http://www.greentechmedia.com/research/report/pv-news Pv News November 2012].
