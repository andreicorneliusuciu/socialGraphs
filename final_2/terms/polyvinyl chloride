The rigid form of PVC is used in [[construction]] for pipe and in profile applications such as doors and windows. It is also used for bottles, other non-food packaging, and cards (such as bank or membership cards). It can be made softer and more flexible by the addition of [[plasticizer]]s, the most widely used being [[phthalates]]. In this form, it is also used in plumbing, electrical cable insulation, imitation leather, signage, inflatable products, and many applications where it replaces rubber.<ref>{{cite book|author=W. V. Titow|title=PVC technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N79YwkVx4kwC&pg=PA6|accessdate=6 October 2011|date=31 December 1984|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-85334-249-6|pages=6\u2013}}</ref>\n\nPure poly(vinyl chloride) is a white, brittle solid. It is insoluble in alcohol but slightly soluble in [[tetrahydrofuran]].\n\n==Discovery==\nPVC was accidentally synthesized in 1872 by German chemist [[Eugen Baumann]].<ref>Baumann, E. (1872) [https://books.google.com/books?id=HNXyAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA308#v=onepage&q&f=false \"Ueber einige Vinylverbindungen\"] (On some vinyl compounds),  ''Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie'', '''163''' :  308\u2013322.</ref> The polymer appeared as a white solid inside a flask of [[vinyl chloride]] that had been left exposed to sunlight. In the early 20th century the Russian chemist [[Ivan Ostromislensky]] and [[Fritz Klatte]] of the German chemical company Griesheim-Elektron both attempted to use PVC in commercial products, but difficulties in processing the rigid, sometimes brittle polymer thwarted their efforts. [[Waldo Semon]] and the [[Goodrich Corporation|B.F. Goodrich Company]] developed a method in 1926 to [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticize]] PVC by blending it with various additives. The result was a more flexible and more easily processed material that soon achieved widespread commercial use.\n\n==Production==\nPolyvinyl chloride is produced by [[polymerization]] of the [[vinyl chloride]] [[monomer]] (VCM), as shown.<ref>{{Cite book|title= Plastics technology handbook | first= Manas | last=Chanda| first2= Salil K.|last2= Roy|publisher = CRC Press|year = 2006|pages=1\u20136|isbn = 978-0-8493-7039-7}}</ref>\n[[File:PVC-polymerisation.svg|center|400px|The polymerisation of vinyl chloride]]\n\nAbout 80% of production involves [[suspension polymerization]]. [[Emulsion polymerization]] accounts for about 12% and [[bulk polymerization]] accounts for 8%. Suspension polymerizations affords particles with average diameters of 100\u2013180&nbsp;\u03bcm, whereas emulsion polymerization gives much smaller particles of average size around 0.2&nbsp;\u03bcm. VCM and water are introduced into the reactor and a polymerization initiator, along with other additives. The reaction vessel is pressure tight to contain the VCM. The contents of the reaction vessel are continually mixed to maintain the suspension and ensure a uniform particle size of the PVC resin. The reaction is [[exothermic]], and thus requires cooling. As the volume is reduced during the reaction (PVC is denser than VCM), water is continually added to the mixture to maintain the suspension.<ref name=ullmannPVC>M. W. Allsopp, G. Vianello, \"Poly(Vinyl Chloride)\" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', 2012, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a21_717}}.</ref>\n\nThe polymerization of VCM is started by compounds called initiators that are mixed into the droplets.  These compounds break down to start the [[Radical polymerization|radical chain reaction]].  Typical initiators include dioctanoyl [[peroxide]]  and dicetyl peroxydicarbonate, both of which have fragile O-O bonds.  Some initiators start the reaction rapidly but decay quickly and other initiators have the opposite effect.  A combination of two different initiators is often used to give a uniform rate of polymerization.  After the polymer has grown by about 10x, the short polymer precipitates inside the droplet of VCM, and polymerization continues with the precipitated, solvent-swollen particles.  The [[weight average molecular weight]]s of commercial polymers range from 100,000 to 200,000 and the number average molecular weights range from 45,000 to 64,000.\n\nOnce the reaction has run its course, the resulting PVC slurry is degassed and stripped to remove excess VCM, which is recycled.  The polymer is then passed through a centrifuge to remove water. The slurry is further dried in a hot air bed, and the resulting powder sieved before storage or pelletization. Normally, the resulting PVC has a VCM content of less than 1 [[part per million]]. Other production processes, such as micro-suspension polymerization and emulsion polymerization, produce PVC with smaller particle sizes (10&nbsp;\u03bcm vs. 120\u2013150&nbsp;\u03bcm for suspension PVC) with slightly different properties and with somewhat different sets of applications.\n\n===Microstructure===\nThe polymers are linear and are strong. The monomers are mainly arranged head-to-tail, meaning that there are chlorides on alternating carbon centres. PVC has mainly an [[Tacticity#Polymers|atactic stereochemistry]], which means that the relative stereochemistry of the [[chloride]] centres are random.  Some degree of [[syndiotactic]]ity of the chain gives a few percent crystallinity that is influential on the properties of the material.  About 57% of the mass of PVC is chlorine. The presence of chloride groups gives the polymer very different properties from the structurally related material [[polyethylene]].<ref>Handbook of Plastics, Elastomers, and Composites, Fourth Edition, 2002 by The McGraw-Hill, Charles A. Harper Editor-in-Chief. ISBN 0-07-138476-6</ref>\n\n==Additives to finished polymer==\nThe product of the polymerization process is unmodified PVC. Before PVC can be made into finished products, it always requires conversion into a compound by the incorporation of additives (but not necessarily all of the following) such as heat stabilizers, [[Ultraviolet|UV]] stabilizers, plasticizers, processing aids, impact modifiers, thermal modifiers, fillers, flame retardants, biocides, blowing agents and smoke suppressors, and, optionally, pigments.<ref name=UllmannPlasticizer>David F. Cadogan and Christopher J. Howick \"Plasticizers\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2000, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI| 10.1002/14356007.a20_439}}</ref> The choice of additives used for the PVC finished product is controlled by the cost performance requirements of the end use specification e.g. underground pipe, window frames, intravenous tubing and flooring all have very different ingredients to suit their performance requirements. Previously, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were added to certain PVC products as flame retardants and stabilizers.<ref>{{cite web|last1 = Karlen|first1 = Kaley|title = Health Concerns and Environmental Issues with PVC-Containing Building Materials in Green Buildings|url = http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/publications/Documents/GreenBuilding%5C43106016.pdf|website = Integrated Waste Management Board|publisher = California Environmental Protection Agency, USA|accessdate = 26 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n===[[Phthalate]] plasticizers===\nMost vinyl products contain [[Plasticizer|plasticizers]] which dramatically improve their performance characteristic. The most common plasticizers are derivatives of phthalic acid.  The materials are selected on their compatibility with the polymer, low volatility levels, and cost.  These materials are usually oily colourless substances that mix well with the PVC particles. About 90% of the plasticizer market, estimated to be millions of tons per year worldwide, is dedicated to PVC.<ref name=UllmannPlasticizer/>\n\n[[File:Bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate.png|thumb|right|220px|[[Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate]] was a common plasticizer for PVC but is being replaced by higher molecular weight phthalates.]]\n\n====High and low molecular weight phthalates====\n[[Phthalate|Phthalates]] can be divided into three groups based on their molecular weight.\n\nLow molecular weight phthalates have 6 or 7 carbon atoms in their alcohol chain. \nMedium molecular weight phthalates have 8 or 9 carbons in their alcohol chain.\nHigh molecular weight phthalates have from 10 to 13 carbons in their alcohol chain.\nLow molecular weight phthalates are no longer used in the US because of high volatility at pvc processing temperatures.\nThe most common medium molecular weight phthalates are DOP ([[dioctyl phthalate]], also known as DEHP, di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate) and DINP ([[diisononyl phthalate]]).\nHigh molecular weight phthalates have a limit of 12 carbons (if linear) or 13 carbons (if branched) in the alcohol chain because phthalates with longer alcohol chains are incompatible with pvc resin.\nThe more common high molecular weight phthalates are DIDP, DPHP and DTDP, all from branched alcohols. There are phthalates from linear alcohols from 8 to 12 carbons which are used when the flexible pvc compound is to have superior low temperature flexibility and improved weathering.\nBecause of possible health effects, there are movements to replace some phthalates such as DOP/DEHP with safer alternatives in [[Canada]], the [[European Union]], and the [[United States]]. In Europe DEHP and DBP are undergoing the REACH Authorisation process [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals]] with results expected in 2014.\nSince no applications for BBP and DIBP were received by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), the use of these substances will be phased out in the EU by 21 February 2015.\n \nMid-high molecular weight phthalates today represent over 85% of all the phthalates currently being produced in Europe (2011). On 31 January 2014 the European Commission published its conclusions regarding the re-evaluation of the restrictions on DINP and DIDP in toys and childcare articles which can be placed in the mouth.The Commission confirmed the main conclusions presented in August last year by the ECHA, which was asked in September 2009 to review any newly available scientific information relative to these two high phthalates.\n\nThe European Commission concluded that \"no unacceptable risk has been characterised for the uses of DINP and DIDP in articles other than toys and childcare articles which can be placed in the mouth\". With regard to the latter, the existent restrictions are nevertheless maintained, based on the precautionary principle. DINP and DIDP are therefore safe for use in all current consumer applications.\nThe European Chemicals Agency also concluded that no further risk management measures are needed to reduce the exposure of adults and children to DINP and DIDP.\n\n===Heat stabilizers===\nOne of the most crucial additives are heat stabilizers.  These agents minimize [[dehydrochlorination|loss of HCl]], a degradation process that starts above 70&nbsp;\u00b0C.  Once dehydrochlorination starts, it is [[autocatalytic]].  Many diverse agents have been used including, traditionally, derivatives of [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]s (lead, cadmium).  Increasingly, metallic soaps (metal \"salts\" of [[fatty acid]]s) are favored, species such as [[calcium stearate]].<ref name=ullmannPVC/> Addition levels vary typically from 2% to 4%.\nThe choice of the best heat stabilizer depends on its cost effectiveness in the end use application, performance specification requirements, processing technology and regulatory approvals.\n\n====Rigid PVC applications====\nRegular PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is a common, strong but lightweight plastic used in construction. It is made softer and more flexible by the addition of plasticizers. If no plasticizers are added, it is known as uPVC (unplasticized polyvinyl chloride), rigid PVC, or vinyl siding in the U.S. \nIn Europe, particularly Belgium, there has been a commitment to eliminate the use of cadmium (previously used as a part component of heat stabilizers in window profiles) and phase out lead based heat stabilizers (as used in pipe and profile areas) such as liquid autodiachromate and calcium polyhydrocummate by 2015. According to the final report of Vinyl 2010<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20140519042304/http://www.vinylplus.eu/uploads/Progress_Report_2011/Vinyl2010-ProgressReport2011_English.pdf Vinyl 2010]. The European PVC Industry's Sustainable Development Programme</ref> cadmium was eliminated across Europe by 2007. The progressive substitution of lead-based stabilizers is also confirmed in the same document showing a reduction of 75% since 2000 and ongoing. This is confirmed by the corresponding growth in '''calcium-based''' stabilizers, used as an alternative to lead-based stabilizers, more and more, also outside Europe.\n\nTin based stabilizers are mainly used in Europe for rigid, transparent applications due to the high temperature processing conditions used. The situation in North America is different where tin systems are used for almost all rigid PVC applications.\nTin stabilizers can be divided into two main groups, the first group containing those with tin-oxygen bonds and the second group with tin-sulphur bonds. According to the European Stabiliser producers<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20140816044857/http://www.stabilisers.org/stabilisers-types/tin-stabilisers Tin stabilisers]. Seuropean Stabiliser Producers Association</ref> most organotin stabilisers have already been successfully REACH registered. More chemical and use information is also available on this site.\n\n====Flexible PVC applications====\nFlexible PVC coated wire and cable for electrical use has traditionally been stabilised with lead but these are being replaced, as in the rigid area, with calcium based systems.\n\nLiquid mixed metal stabilisers are used in several PVC flexible applications such as [[Calendering|calendered]] films, extruded profiles, injection moulded soles and footwear, extruded hoses and plastisols where PVC paste is spread on to a backing (flooring, wall covering, artificial leather). Liquid mixed metal stabiliser systems are primarily based on barium, zinc and calcium carboxylates. In general liquid mixed metals like BaZn, CaZn require the addition of co-stabilisers, antioxidants and organo-phosphites to provide optimum performance.\n\nBaZn stabilisers have successfully replaced cadmium-based stabilisers in Europe in many PVC semi-rigid and flexible applications according to the European producers.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20150726001713/http://www.stabilisers.eu/stabilisers-types/liquid-stabilisers Liquid stabilisers].

The mechanical properties enhance with the molecular weight increasing but decrease with the temperature increasing. The mechanical properties of rigid PVC (uPVC) are very good; the [[elastic modulus]] can reach 1500-3,000 MPa. The soft PVC (flexible PVC) elastic is 1.5\u201315 MPa.\n\n===Thermal and fire properties===\nThe heat stability of raw PVC is very poor, so the addition of a heat stabilizer during the process is necessary in order to ensure the product's properties. PVC starts to decompose when the temperature reaches 140&nbsp;\u00b0C, with melting temperature starting around 160&nbsp;\u00b0C. The linear expansion coefficient of rigid PVC is small and has good flame retardancy, the [[Limiting oxygen index]] (LOI) being up to 45 or more. The LOI is the minimum concentration of oxygen, expressed as a percentage, that will support combustion of a polymer and noting that air has 20% content of oxygen.\n\n===Electrical properties===\nPVC is a polymer with good insulation properties, but because of its higher polar nature the electrical insulating property is inferior to non polar polymers such as [[polyethylene]] and [[polypropylene]].\n\nSince the dielectric constant, dielectric loss tangent value, and volume resistivity are high, the corona resistance is not very good, and it is generally suitable for medium or low voltage and low frequency insulation materials.\n\n===Chemical properties===\nPVC is chemical resistant to acids, salts, bases, fats, and alcohols therefore it is used in sewerage piping. It is also resistant to some solvents, mainly uPVC. Plasticized PVC is in some cases less resistant to solvents. For example, PVC is resistant to fuel and some paint thinners. Some solvents may only swell it or deform it but not dissolve it, but some of them, like tetrahydrofuran or acetone, may damage it.\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:Laying sewer hi res (2).jpg|thumb|PVC is used extensively in sewage pipe due to its low cost, chemical resistance and ease of jointing]]\n\nPVC's relatively low cost, biological and chemical resistance and workability have resulted in it being used for a wide variety of applications. It is used for [[sanitary sewer|sewerage pipe]]s and other pipe applications where cost or vulnerability to [[corrosion]] limit the use of [[metal]]. With the addition of impact modifiers and stabilizers, PVC scrap has become a popular material for [[window]] and [[door]]  which is 50% less than the cost of wooden window and door. By adding plasticizers, it can become flexible enough to be used in cabling applications as a [[wire]] insulator. It has been used in [[#Other applications|many other applications]]. In 2013, about 39.3 million [[tonne]]s of PVC were consumed worldwide. PVC demand is forecast to increase at an average annual rate of 3.2% until 2021.<ref>[http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/plastics/polyvinyl-chloride Market Study: Polyvinyl Chloride (3rd Edition)].

However, it must be carefully installed and bedded to ensure longitudinal cracking and overbelling does not occur.  Additionally, PVC pipes can be fused together using various solvent cements, or heat-fused (butt-fusion process, similar to joining [[High-density polyethylene|HDPE]] pipe), creating permanent joints that are virtually impervious to leakage.\n\nIn February 2007 the California Building Standards Code was updated to approve the use of [[chlorinated polyvinyl chloride]] (CPVC) pipe for use in residential [[water supply]] piping systems. CPVC has been a nationally accepted material in the US since 1982; [[California]], however, has permitted only limited use since 2001. The Department of Housing and Community Development prepared and certified an [[environmental impact statement]] resulting in a recommendation that the Commission adopt and approve the use of CPVC. The Commission's vote was unanimous and CPVC has been placed in the 2007 California Plumbing Code.\n\nIn the United States and [[Canada]], PVC pipes account for the largest majority of pipe materials used in buried municipal applications for [[drinking water]] distribution and [[wastewater]] mains.<ref>{{cite journal\n| author = Rahman, Shah \n| date=October 2004\n| title = Thermoplastics at Work: A Comprehensive Review of Municipal PVC Piping Products\n| journal = Underground Construction\n| pages = 56\u201361\n| url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/101375360/Comprehensive-Review-of-Municipal-PVC-Pipe-Products\n| format=PDF}}</ref> Buried PVC pipes in both water and sanitary sewer applications that are {{convert|4|in|mm}} in diameter and larger are typically joined by means of a gasket-sealed joint.

As flat sheets, PVC is often expanded to create voids in the interior of the material, providing additional thickness without additional weight and minimal extra cost (see [[Closed-cell PVC foamboard]]). Sheets are cut using [[saw]] and rotary cutting equipment. Plasticized PVC is also used to produce thin, colored, or clear, [[adhesive]]-backed films referred to simply as vinyl.

[[PVC clothing]] is common in [[Goth subculture|Goth]], [[Punk rock|Punk]], [[clothing fetish]] and [[alternative fashion]]s. PVC is less expensive than [[rubber]], leather, and [[latex]] which it is therefore used to simulate.\n\nPVC fabric is [[water-resistant]] so is used in coats, skiing equipment, shoes, [[jacket]]s, [[apron]]s, and bags.\n\n===Healthcare===\nThe two main application areas for single use medically approved PVC compounds are flexible containers and tubing: containers used for blood and blood components, for urine collection or for ostomy products and tubing used for blood taking and blood giving sets, catheters, heart-lung bypass sets, hemodialysis sets etc. In Europe the consumption of PVC for medical devices is approximately 85.000 tons every year. Almost one third of plastic based medical devices are made from PVC.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20150607064149/http://www.pvcmed.org/learning-centre/pvc-medical-applications/ PVC Healthcare Applications]. pvcmed.org</ref>\nThe reasons for using flexible PVC in these applications for over 50 years are numerous and based on cost effectiveness linked to transparency, light weight, softness, tear strength, kink resistance, suitability for sterilization and biocompatibility.\n\n====Plasticisers====\nDEHP (Di-2ethylhexylphthalate) has been medically approved for many years for use in such medical devices; the PVC-DEHP combination proving to be very suitable for making blood bags because DEHP stabilises red blood cells, minimising haemolysis (red blood cell rupture). However, DEHP is coming under increasing pressure in Europe. The assessment of potential risks related to phthalates, and in particular the use of DEHP in PVC medical devices, was subject to scientific and policy review by the European Union authorities, and on 21 March 2010, a specific labelling requirement was introduced across the EU for all devices containing phthalates that are classified as CMR (carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction).<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/emerging/docs/scenihr_o_047.pdf  Opinion on The safety of medical devices containing DEHPplasticized PVC or other plasticizers on neonates and other groups possibly at risk (2015 update)]. Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly-Identified Health Risks (25 June 2015).</ref> The label aims to enable healthcare professionals to use this equipment safely, and, where needed, take appropriate precautionary measures for patients at risk of over-exposure.\n\nDEHP alternatives, which are gradually replacing it, are Adipates, Butyryltrihexylcitrate (BTHC), Cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid, diisononylester (DINCH), Di(2-ethylhexyl)terephthalate, polymerics and trimellitic acid, 2-ethylhexylester (TOTM).\n\n===Flooring===\nFlexible PVC [[flooring]] is inexpensive and used in a variety of buildings covering the home, hospitals, offices, schools, etc. Complex and [[3D space|3D]] designs are possible due to the prints that can be created which are then protected by a clear wear layer. A middle vinyl foam layer also gives a comfortable and safe feel. The smooth, tough surface of the upper wear layer prevents the buildup of dirt, which prevents microbes from breeding in areas that need to be kept sterile, such as hospitals and clinics.\n\n{{see also|Vinyl composition tile}}\n\n===Other applications===\n[[File:Swiss army knife open 20050612 (cropped).jpg|thumb|The handles of the [[Victorinox]] [[Swiss Army knife|Swiss Army knives]] are made of PVC.]]\n\nPVC has been used for a host of consumer products of relatively smaller volume compared to the industrial and commercial applications described above. Another of its earliest mass-market consumer applications was to make [[vinyl records]]. More recent examples include wallcovering, greenhouses, home playgrounds, foam and other toys, custom truck toppers ([[tarpaulin]]s), ceiling tiles and other kinds of interior cladding.\n\nPVC piping is cheaper than metals used in musical instrument making; it is therefore a common alternative when making instruments, often for leisure or for rarer instruments such as the [[contrabass flute]].<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20150704042228/http://devices.natetrue.com/pvc/pvc.htm Building a PVC Instrument]. natetrue.com</ref>\n\n==Chlorinated PVC==\nPVC can be usefully modified by chlorination, which increases its chlorine content to 67%.  The new material has a higher heat resistance so is primarily used for hot water pipe and fittings, but it is more expensive and it is found only in niche applications, such as certain water heaters and certain specialized clothing. An extensive market for chlorinated PVC is in pipe for use in office building, apartment and condominium fire protection. [[CPVC]], as it is called, is produced by chlorination of aqueous solution of suspension PVC particles followed by exposure to [[Ultraviolet|UV light]] which initiates the free-radical chlorination.<ref name=ullmannPVC/>\n\n==Health and safety==\n\n===Degradation===\nDegradation during service life, or after careless disposal, is a chemical change that drastically reduces the average molecular weight of the polyvinyl chloride polymer. Since the mechanical integrity of a plastic depends on its high average molecular weight, wear and tear inevitably weakens the material. Weathering degradation of plastics results in their surface embrittlement and microcracking, yielding microparticles that continue on in the environment. Also known as [[microplastics]], these particles act like sponges and soak up [[Persistent Organic Pollutants]] (POPs) around them. Thus laden with high levels of POPs, the microparticles are often ingested by organisms in the biosphere.\n\nHowever, there is evidence that three of the polymers (HDPE, LDPE, and PP) consistently soaked up POPs at concentrations an order of magnitude higher than did the remaining two (PVC and PET). After 12 months of exposure, for example, there was a 34-fold difference in average total POPs amassed on LDPE compared to PET at one location. At another site, average total POPs adhered to HDPE was nearly 30 times that of PVC. The researchers think that differences in the size and shape of the polymer molecules can explain why some accumulate more pollutants than others.<ref>[http://www.algalita.org/blog/?p=3740 Plastic Debris Delivers Triple Toxic Whammy, Ocean Study Shows \u2013 Algalita | Marine Research and EducationAlgalita | Marine Research and Education].

In Europe, for example, DINP can no longer be used in toys and childcare items that can be put in the mouth even though the EU scientific risk assessment concluded that its use in toys does not pose a risk to human health or the environment.\nThe rigorous EU risk assessments, which include a high degree of conservatism and built-in safety factors, have been carried out under the strict supervision of the European Commission and provide a clear scientific evaluation on which to judge whether or not a particular substance can be safely used.\n\nThe FDA Paper titled \"Safety Assessment of Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP)Released from PVC Medical Devices\" states that [3.2.1.3] Critically ill or injured patients may be at increased risk of developing adverse health effects from DEHP, not only by virtue of increased exposure relative to the general population, but also because of the physiological and pharmacodynamic changes that occur in these patients compared to healthy individuals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ost/dehp-pvc.pdf|format=PDF|title=Safety Assessment ofDi(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP)Released from PVC Medical Devices}}</ref>\n\n===Lead===\n\nThe metal [[lead]] had previously been frequently added to PVC to improve workability and stability.

Extensive studies in Europe indicate that the chlorine found in emitted dioxins is not derived from HCl in the [[flue gases]]. Instead, most dioxins arise in the condensed solid phase by the reaction of inorganic chlorides with graphitic structures in char-containing ash particles. Copper acts as a catalyst for these reactions.<ref>Steiglitz, L., and Vogg, H.

A survey of international studies consistently identifies high dioxin concentrations in areas affected by open waste burning and a study that looked at the homologue pattern found the sample with the highest dioxin concentration was \"typical for the pyrolysis of PVC\".

To comply with the EU emission limit of 0.1&nbsp;ng I-TEQ/m3 modern incinerators operate in conditions minimising dioxin formation and are equipped with pollution control devices which catch the low amounts produced. Recent information is showing for example that dioxin levels in populations near incinerators in Lisbon and Madeira have not risen since the plants began operating in 1999 and 2002 respectively.\n\nSeveral studies have also shown that removing PVC from waste would not significantly reduce the quantity of dioxins emitted. The European Union Commission published in July 2000 a Green Paper on the Environmental Issues of PVC. \"<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/pvc/pdf/en.pdf Environmental issues of PVC]. European Commission. Brussels, 26 July 2000</ref> The Commission states (page 27) that it has been suggested that the reduction of the chlorine content in the waste can contribute to the reduction of dioxin formation, even though the actual mechanism is not fully understood. The influence on the reduction is also expected to be a second or third order relationship. It is most likely that the main incineration parameters, such as the temperature and the oxygen concentration, have a major influence on the dioxin formation\". The Green Paper states further that at the current levels of chlorine in municipal waste, there does not seem to be a direct quantitative relationship between chlorine content and dioxin formation.\n\nA study commissioned by the European Commission on \"Life Cycle Assessment of PVC and of principal competing materials\" states that \"Recent studies show that the presence of PVC has no significant effect on the amount of dioxins released through incineration of plastic waste.\"<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20140327075103/http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/chemicals/files/sustdev/pvc-final_report_lca_en.pdf Life Cycle Assessment of PVC and of principal competing materials Commissioned by the European Commission].

According to the Waste Framework Directive, the European Waste Hierarchy is legally binding except in cases that may require specific waste streams to depart from the hierarchy. This should be justified on the basis of life-cycle thinking.\n\nThe European Commission has set new rules to promote the recovery of PVC waste for use in a number of construction products.

The production process also uses sodium chloride. Recycled PVC is broken down into small chips, impurities removed, and the product refined to make pure white PVC. It can be recycled roughly seven times and has a lifespan of around 140 years.\n\nIn the UK, approximately 400 tonnes of PVC are recycled every month. Property owners can recycle it through nationwide collection depots. The [[Olympic Delivery Authority]] (ODA), for example, after initially rejecting PVC as material for different temporary venues of the [[London Olympics 2012]], has reviewed its decision and developed a policy for its use.<ref>[http://learninglegacy.independent.gov.uk/documents/pdfs/sustainability/cp-london-2012-use-of-pvc-policy.pdf London 2012 Use of PVC Policy]. independent.gov.uk.</ref> This policy highlighted that the functional properties of PVC make it the most appropriate material in certain circumstances while taking into consideration the environmental and social impacts across the whole life cycle, e.g. the rate for recycling or reuse and the percentage of recycled content. Temporary parts, like roofing covers of the [[Olympic Stadium (London)|Olympic Stadium]], the [[Water Polo Arena]], and the [[Royal Artillery Barracks]], would be deconstructed and a part recycled in the [[Vinyloop|Vinyloop process]].<ref>[http://learninglegacy.independent.gov.uk/documents/pdfs/design-and-engineering-innovation/221-implementation-of-pvc-policy.pdf London 2012]. independent.gov.uk.</ref><ref>Clark, Anthony (31 July 2012) [http://www.plasticsnews.com/article/20120731/NEWS/307319979/pvc-at-olympics-destined-for-reuse-or-recycling PVC at Olympics destined for reuse or recycling]. plasticsnews.com</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Plastic pressure pipe systems]]\n* [[Plastic recycling]]\n* [[Polyethylene]]\n* [[Polypropylene]]\n* [[Polymer clay]]\n* [[Polyvinyl fluoride]]\n* [[Polyvinylidene chloride]]\n* [[Polyvinylidene fluoride]]\n* [[PVC Clothing|PVC clothing]]\n* [[PVC decking]]\n* [[PVC fetishism]]\n* [[Vinyl roof membrane]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{Cite book |last=Titow |first=W. |title=PVC Technology |publisher=Elsevier Applied Science Publishers |location=London |year=1984 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N79YwkVx4kwC |isbn=978-0-85334-249-6 }}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Polyvinyl chloride}}\n<!-- This is not an open ended list of campaign sites.
