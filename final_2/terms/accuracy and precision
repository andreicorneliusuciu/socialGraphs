For example, if an experiment contains a [[systematic error]], then increasing the [[sample size]] generally increases precision but does not improve accuracy. The result would be a consistent yet inaccurate string of results from the flawed experiment.  Eliminating the systematic error improves accuracy but does not change precision.\n\nA measurement system is considered ''valid'' if it is both ''accurate'' and ''precise''. Related terms include ''bias'' (non-[[random]] or directed effects caused by a factor or factors unrelated to the [[independent variable]]) and ''error'' (random variability).\n\nThe terminology is also applied to indirect measurements\u2014that is, values obtained by a computational procedure from observed data.\n\nIn addition to accuracy and precision, measurements may also have a [[Sensor#Resolution|measurement resolution]], which is the smallest change in the underlying physical quantity that produces a response in the measurement.\n\nIn [[numerical analysis]], accuracy is also the nearness of a calculation to the true value; while precision is the resolution of the representation, typically defined by the number of decimal or binary digits.\n\nStatistical literature prefers to use the terms ''[[Bias (statistics)|bias]]'' and ''[[Variability (statistics)|variability]]'' instead of accuracy and precision: bias is the amount of inaccuracy and variability is the amount of imprecision.\nIn military terms, accuracy refers primarily to the accuracy of fire (or \"justesse de tir\"), the precision of fire expressed by the closeness of a grouping of shots at and around the centre of the target.<ref>North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Nato Standardization Agency AAP-6 - Glossary of terms and definitions, p 43.</ref>\n\n===Quantification===\n{{see also|False precision}}\nIn industrial instrumentation, accuracy is the measurement tolerance, or transmission of the instrument and defines the limits of the errors made when the instrument is used in normal operating conditions.<ref>Creus, Antonio. ''Instrumentaci\u00f3n Industrial''{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}</ref>\n\nIdeally a measurement device is both accurate and precise, with measurements all close to and tightly clustered around the true value. The accuracy and precision of a measurement process is usually established by repeatedly measuring some [[traceability|traceable]] reference [[Technical standard|standard]]. Such standards are defined in the [[SI|International System of Units]] (abbreviated SI from French: Syst\u00e8me international d'unit\u00e9s) and maintained by national [[standards organization]]s such as the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] in the United States.\n\nThis also applies when measurements are repeated and averaged. In that case, the term [[standard error (statistics)|standard error]] is properly applied: the precision of the average is equal to the known standard deviation of the process divided by the square root of the number of measurements averaged. Further, the [[central limit theorem]] shows that the [[probability distribution]] of the averaged measurements will be closer to a normal distribution than that of individual measurements.\n\nWith regard to accuracy we can distinguish:\n*the difference between the [[mean]] of the measurements and the reference value, the [[bias of an estimator|bias]]. Establishing and correcting for bias is necessary for [[calibration]].\n*the combined effect of that and precision.\n\nA common convention in science and engineering is to express accuracy and/or precision implicitly by means of [[significant figures]]. Here, when not explicitly stated, the margin of error is understood to be one-half the value of the last significant place. For instance, a recording of 843.6&nbsp;m, or 843.0&nbsp;m, or 800.0&nbsp;m would imply a margin of 0.05&nbsp;m (the last significant place is the tenths place), while a recording of 8,436&nbsp;m would imply a margin of error of 0.5&nbsp;m (the last significant digits are the units).\n\nA reading of 8,000&nbsp;m, with trailing zeroes and no decimal point, is ambiguous; the trailing zeroes may or may not be intended as significant figures. To avoid this ambiguity, the number could be represented in scientific notation: 8.0&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;m indicates that the first zero is significant (hence a margin of 50&nbsp;m) while 8.000&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;m indicates that all three zeroes are significant, giving a margin of 0.5&nbsp;m. Similarly, it is possible to use a multiple of the basic measurement unit: 8.0&nbsp;km is equivalent to 8.0&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;m. In fact, it indicates a margin of 0.05&nbsp;km (50&nbsp;m). However, reliance on this convention can lead to [[false precision]] errors when accepting data from sources that do not obey it.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nPrecision is sometimes stratified into:\n*''Repeatability'' &mdash; the variation arising when all efforts are made to keep conditions constant by using the same instrument and operator, and repeating during a short time period; and\n*''Reproducibility'' &mdash; the variation arising using the same measurement process among different instruments and operators, and over longer time periods.\n\n=={{visible anchor|ISO definition (ISO 5725)|ISO_Definition_.28ISO_5725.29}}==\n[[File:Accuracy (trueness and precision).svg|300px|thumb|right|According to ISO 5725-1, Accuracy consists of Trueness (proximity of measurement results to the true value) and Precision (repeatability or reproducibility of the measurement)]]\nA shift in the meaning of these terms appeared with the publication of the ISO 5725 series of standards in 1994, which is also reflected in the 2008 issue of the \"BIPM International Vocabulary of Metrology\" (VIM), items 2.13 and 2.14.<ref name=\"metrology_terms\"/>\n\nAccording to ISO 5725-1,<ref>BS ISO 5725-1: \"Accuracy (trueness and precision) of measurement methods and results - Part 1: General principles and definitions.\", p.1 (1994)</ref> the general term \"'''accuracy'''\" is used to describe the closeness of a measurement to the true value. When the term is applied to sets of measurements of the same ''measurand'', it involves a component of random error and a component of systematic error. In this case '''trueness''' is the closeness of the mean of a set of measurement results to the actual (true) value and '''precision''' is the closeness of agreement among a set of results.\n\nISO 5725-1 and VIM also avoid the use of the term \"[[Bias (statistics)|bias]]\", previously specified in BS 5497-1,<ref>BS 5497-1: \"Precision of test methods. Guide for the determination of repeatability and reproducibility for a standard test method.\" (1979)</ref> because it has different connotations outside the fields of science and engineering, as in medicine and law.\n\n{{Gallery\n|title=Accuracy of a [[Grouping (firearms)|target grouping]] according to BIPM and ISO 5725\n|width=150  \n|align=center\n| File:High accuracy Low precision.svg|Low accuracy, poor precision, good trueness <!-- note that filename's use of \"high accuracy\" is not in accord with the ISO 52725 terminology that's illustrated here -->\n| File:High precision Low accuracy.svg|Low accuracy, good precision, poor trueness\n}}\n\n==In binary classification==\n{{main article|Evaluation of binary classifiers}}\n''Accuracy'' is also used as a statistical measure of how well a [[binary classification]] test correctly identifies or excludes a condition.

''Precision'' is a synonym for [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] and ''variable error''. The validity of a measurement instrument or psychological test is established through experiment or correlation with behavior. Reliability is established with a variety of statistical techniques, classically through an internal consistency test like [[Cronbach's alpha]] to ensure sets of related questions have related responses, and then comparison of those related question between reference and target population.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n==In logic simulation==\nIn [[logic simulation]], a common mistake in evaluation of accurate models is to compare a [[electronic circuit simulation|logic simulation model]] to a [[transistor]] [[transistor models|circuit simulation model]].
