Examples would be landing at a very high altitude or near sea level in conditions of exceptionally high air pressure. Old altimeters were typically limited to show altitude when set between 950 mbar and 1030 mbar. \"Standard\" pressure, the baseline used universally, is 1013.25 hPa, equivalent to 1013.25 mbar or 29.92 inHg (inches of mercury). This setting is equivalent to the air pressure at mean sea level ([[Sea Level|MSL]]) in the International Standard Atmosphere ([[International Standard Atmosphere|ISA]]). Pressure altitude is primarily used in aircraft performance calculations and in high-altitude flight (above the [[Flight level#Transition altitude|transition altitude]]). \n\n;QNE: The term \"QNE\" refers to the indicated altitude at the landing runway threshold when 1013.25 mbar or 29.92 inHg is set in the altimeter's Kollsman window.\n\nMost aviation texts for PPL and CPL exams describe a process of finding pressure altitude using the following formula:\n\nPressure Altitude (PA) = Hgt + 1000 x (29.92 - altimeter setting)\n\nFor example if the airfield elevation is 500 feet and the altimeter setting is 29.32 inHg then\n\nPA = 500 + 1000 x (29.92 - 29.32) \n     = 500 + 1000 x 0.6\n     = 500 + 600\n     = 1100 feet\n\nAlternatively, Pressure Altitude (PA) = Hgt + 30 x (1013 - [[QNH]])  \n\nFor example if the airfield elevation is 500 feet and the QNH is 993 mbar then\n\nPA = 500 + 30 x (1013 - 993)\n     = 500 + 30 x 20\n     = 500 + 600\n     = 1100 feet\n\n[[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Aircraft Mode \"C\" transponders]] report the pressure altitude to air traffic control; corrections for atmospheric pressure variations are applied by the recipient of the data.\n\nThe relationship between static pressure and pressure altitude is defined in terms of the properties of the International Standard Atmosphere.\n\n==See also==\n*[[QNH]]\n*[[Flight Level]]\n*[[Density altitude]]\n*[[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure]] \n*[[Barometric formula]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.newbyte.co.il/calc.html Newbyte Atmospheric Calculator], [http://market.android.com/details?id=appinventor.ai_barkan86.AtmosCalculatorFree Android Version]\n[[Category:Altitudes in aviation]]"}]}}}}
