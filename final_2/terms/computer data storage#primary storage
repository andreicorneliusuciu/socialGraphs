When used within a robotic [[tape library]], it is classified as ''tertiary'' storage instead.]]\n\n'''Computer data storage''', often called '''storage''' or '''memory''', is a technology consisting of [[computer]] components and [[Data storage device|recording media]] used to retain digital [[data (computing)|data]]. It is a core function and fundamental component of computers.<ref>https://www.google.co.uk/?client=ubuntu#channel=fs&q=why+is+memory+needed+in+a+computer</ref>\n\nThe [[central processing unit]] (CPU) of a computer is what manipulates data by performing computations.  In practice, almost all computers use a [[memory hierarchy|storage hierarchy]], which puts fast but expensive and small storage options close to the CPU and slower but larger and cheaper options farther away. Generally the fast volatile technologies (which lose data when off power) are referred to as \"memory\", while slower persistent technologies are referred to as \"storage\"; however, \"memory\" is sometimes also used when referring to persistent storage.\n\nIn the [[Von Neumann architecture]], the CPU consists of two main parts: The [[control unit]] and the [[arithmetic / logic unit]] (ALU). The former controls the flow of data between the CPU and memory, while the latter performs arithmetic and [[Bitwise operations|logical operations]] on data.\n\n== Functionality ==\nWithout a significant amount of memory, a computer would merely be able to perform fixed operations and immediately output the result. It would have to be reconfigured to change its behavior. This is acceptable for devices such as desk [[calculator]]s, [[digital signal processing|digital signal processors]], and other specialized devices. [[von Neumann architecture|Von Neumann]] machines differ in having a memory in which they store their operating [[instruction (computer science)|instruction]]s and data.<ref>https://fa82ee93-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/michaeldgodfrey/vonneumann/vnedvac.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7cpmAF0rclXOyZ-kmW88qTSR0Q0grAsGT0zHJgyuwjO_dLAGjBRboYCqeXr6IbN5awZMQtg60tgonsYNM8S7We0LPqFSJlfu0UI3Wx3go7Gu6kMuQr2L-i4mN54Tz7KC7TCd9H_b_cq8yYL_Q-5OtPCHqlpjg5NUEQFjVPmF_kHWoolLlowoedMeFNBkqaFIz_w-1wvorHp69RIt7Z7hOQZjsTffpT8oQjZ3dsiJx228HtAY7BA%3D&attredirects=0</ref> Such computers are more versatile in that they do not need to have their hardware reconfigured for each new program, but can simply be [[computer programming|reprogrammed]] with new in-memory instructions; they also tend to be simpler to design, in that a relatively simple processor may keep [[program state|state]] between successive computations to build up complex procedural results. Most modern computers are von Neumann machines.\n\n== Data organization and representation ==\nA modern [[Computer|digital computer]] represents [[data]] using the [[binary numeral system]]. Text, numbers, pictures, audio, and nearly any other form of information can be converted into a string of [[bit]]s, or binary digits, each of which has a value of 1 or 0. The most common unit of storage is the [[byte]], equal to 8 bits. A piece of information can be handled by any computer or device whose storage space is large enough to accommodate ''the binary representation of the piece of information'', or simply [[data (computing)|data]]. For example, the [[complete works of Shakespeare]], about 1250 pages in print, can be stored in about five [[megabyte]]s (40 million bits) with one byte per character.\n\nData is [[Encoding|encoded]] by assigning a bit pattern to each [[Character (computing)|character]], [[Numerical digit|digit]], or [[multimedia]] object. Many standards exist for encoding (e.g., [[character encoding]]s like [[ASCII]], image encodings like [[JPEG]], video encodings like [[MPEG-4]]).\n\nBy adding bits to each encoded unit, redundancy allows the computer to both detect errors in coded data and correct them based on mathematical algorithms. Errors generally occur in low probabilities due to [[random]] bit value flipping, or \"physical bit fatigue\", loss of the physical bit in storage its ability to maintain distinguishable value (0 or 1), or due to errors in inter or intra-computer communication. A random [[RAM parity|bit flip]] (e.g., due to random [[radiation]]) is typically corrected upon detection. A bit, or a group of malfunctioning physical bits (not always the specific defective bit is known; group definition depends on specific storage device) is typically automatically fenced-out, taken out of use by the device, and replaced with another functioning equivalent group in the device, where the corrected bit values are restored (if possible). The [[cyclic redundancy check]] (CRC) method is typically used in communications and storage for [[error detection and correction|error detection]].  A detected error is then retried.\n\n[[Data compression]] methods allow in many cases (such as a database) to represent a string of bits by a shorter bit string (\"compress\") and reconstruct the original string (\"decompress\") when needed. This utilizes substantially less storage (tens of percents) for many types of data at the cost of more computation (compress and decompress when needed). Analysis of trade-off between storage cost saving and costs of related computations and possible delays in data availability is done before deciding whether to keep certain data compressed or not.\n\nFor [[data security|security reasons]] certain types of data (e.g., credit-card information) may be kept [[encryption|encrypted]] in storage to prevent the possibility of unauthorized information reconstruction from chunks of storage snapshots.\n\n== Hierarchy of storage ==\n{{main article|Memory hierarchy}}\n{{Contradicts other|date=March 2013|1=Memory hierarchy}}\n[[File:Computer storage types.svg|thumb|right|350px|Various forms of storage, divided according to their distance from the [[central processing unit]]. The fundamental components of a general-purpose computer are [[arithmetic logic unit|arithmetic and logic unit]], [[control unit|control circuitry]], storage space, and [[input/output]] devices. Technology and capacity as in common [[home computer]]s around 2005.]]\n\nGenerally, the lower a storage is in the hierarchy, the lesser its [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] and the greater its access [[latency (engineering)|latency]] is from the CPU. This traditional division of storage to primary, secondary, tertiary and off-line storage is also guided by cost per bit.\n\nIn contemporary usage, \"memory\" is usually [[semiconductor]] storage read-write [[random-access memory]], typically [[DRAM]] (dynamic RAM) or other forms of fast but temporary storage. \"Storage\" consists of storage devices and their media not directly accessible by the [[CPU]] ([[Secondary storage|secondary]] or [[tertiary storage]]), typically [[hard disk drive]]s, [[optical disc]] drives, and other devices slower than RAM but [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] (retaining contents when powered down).<ref>''Storage'' as defined in Microsoft Computing Dictionary, 4th Ed. (c)1999 or in The Authoritative Dictionary of IEEE Standard Terms, 7th Ed., (c) 2000.</ref>\n\nHistorically, ''memory'' has been called ''core memory'', ''main memory'', ''real storage'' or ''internal memory''. Meanwhile, non-volatile storage devices have been referred to as ''secondary storage'', ''external memory'' or ''auxiliary/peripheral storage''.\n\n=== Primary storage ===\n<!-- Additional DIRECT links point to this section by its name. -->\n{{main article|Computer memory}}\n\n''Primary storage'' (also known as ''main memory'' or ''internal memory''), often referred to simply as ''memory'', is the only one directly accessible to the CPU. The CPU continuously reads instructions stored there and executes them as required. Any data actively operated on is also stored there in uniform manner.\n\nHistorically, [[History of computing hardware|early computers]] used [[delay line memory|delay lines]], [[Williams tube]]s, or rotating [[drum memory|magnetic drums]] as primary storage. By 1954, those unreliable methods were mostly replaced by [[magnetic core memory]]. Core memory remained dominant until the 1970s, when advances in [[integrated circuit]] technology allowed [[semiconductor memory]] to become economically competitive.<!-- Please DO NOT EXPAND above text! Change but no expand any further. Anyone desiring to know more types, let it be [[twister memory]] or [[bubble memory]] etc, will click the History link. Do not confuse other readers. -->\n\nThis led to modern [[random-access memory]] (RAM). It is small-sized, light, but quite expensive at the same time. (The particular types of RAM used for primary storage are also [[volatile memory|volatile]], i.e. they lose the information when not powered).\n\nAs shown in the diagram, traditionally there are two more sub-layers of the primary storage, besides main large-capacity RAM:\n* [[Processor register]]s are located inside the processor. Each register typically holds a [[Word (computer architecture)|word]] of data (often 32 or 64 bits). CPU instructions instruct the [[arithmetic logic unit]] to perform various calculations or other operations on this data (or with the help of it). Registers are the fastest of all forms of computer data storage.\n* [[CPU cache|Processor cache]] is an intermediate stage between ultra-fast registers and much slower main memory. It was introduced solely to improve the performance of computers. Most actively used information in the main memory is just duplicated in the cache memory, which is faster, but of much lesser capacity. On the other hand, main memory is much slower, but has a much greater storage capacity than processor registers. Multi-level [[Memory hierarchy|hierarchical cache]] setup is also commonly used\u2014''primary cache'' being smallest, fastest and located inside the processor; ''secondary cache'' being somewhat larger and slower. <!-- Please DO NOT EXPAND above text, especially with L1/L2/etc variants - reader can always click the link. -->\n\nMain memory is directly or indirectly connected to the central processing unit via a ''memory bus''. It is actually two buses (not on the diagram): an [[address bus]] and a [[Bus (computing)|data bus]]. The CPU firstly sends a number through an address bus, a number called [[memory address]], that indicates the desired location of data. Then it reads or writes the data in the [[Memory cell (binary)|memory cell]]s  using the data bus. Additionally, a [[memory management unit]] (MMU) is a small device between CPU and RAM recalculating the actual memory address, for example to provide an abstraction of [[virtual memory]] or other tasks.\n\nAs the RAM types used for primary storage are volatile (uninitialized at start up), a computer containing only such storage would not have a source to read instructions from, in order to start the computer. Hence, [[Non-volatile memory|non-volatile primary storage]] containing a small startup program ([[BIOS]]) is used to [[Bootstrapping (computing)|bootstrap]] the computer, that is, to read a larger program from non-volatile ''secondary'' storage to RAM and start to execute it. A non-volatile technology used for this purpose is called ROM, for [[read-only memory]] (the terminology may be somewhat confusing as most ROM types are also capable of ''[[random access]]'').\n\nMany types of \"ROM\" are not literally ''read only'', as updates to them are possible; however it is slow and memory must be erased in large portions before it can be re-written. Some [[embedded system]]s run programs directly from ROM (or similar), because such programs are rarely changed. Standard computers do not store non-rudimentary programs in ROM, and rather, use large capacities of secondary storage, which is non-volatile as well, and not as costly.\n\nRecently, ''primary storage'' and ''secondary storage'' in some uses refer to what was historically called, respectively, ''secondary storage'' and ''tertiary storage''.<ref>[http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/topics/0,295493,sid5_tax298620,00.html \"Primary Storage or Storage Hardware\" (shows usage of term \"primary storage\" meaning \"hard disk storage\")]. Searchstorage.techtarget.com (2011-06-13). Retrieved on 2011-06-18.</ref>\n\n=== Secondary storage ===\n<!-- Note that additional DIRECT links point to this section by its name. -->\n[[File:Hard disk platter reflection.jpg|thumb|A [[hard disk drive]] with protective cover removed.]]\n{{main article|Auxiliary memory}}\n\n''Secondary storage'' (also known as external memory or auxiliary storage), differs from primary storage in that it is not directly accessible by the CPU. The computer usually uses its [[input/output]] channels to access secondary storage and transfers the desired data using [[Data buffer|intermediate area]] in primary storage. Secondary storage does not lose the data when the device is powered down\u2014it is non-volatile. Per unit, it is typically also two orders of magnitude less expensive than primary storage. Modern computer systems typically have two orders of magnitude more secondary storage than primary storage and data are kept for a longer time there.\n\nIn modern computers, [[hard disk drive]]s are usually used as secondary storage. The time taken to access a given byte of information stored on a hard disk is typically a few thousandths of a second, or milliseconds. By contrast, the time taken to access a given byte of information stored in random-access memory is measured in billionths of a second, or nanoseconds. This illustrates the  significant access-time difference which distinguishes solid-state memory from rotating magnetic storage devices: hard disks are typically about a million times slower than memory. Rotating [[Optical disc drive|optical storage]] devices, such as [[Compact Disc|CD]] and [[DVD]] drives, have even longer access times. With disk drives, once the disk read/write head reaches the proper placement and the data of interest rotates under it, subsequent data on the track are very fast to access. To reduce the seek time and rotational latency, data are transferred to and from disks in large contiguous blocks.\n\nWhen data reside on disk, blocking access to hide latency offers an opportunity to design efficient [[external memory algorithms]]. Sequential or block access on disks is orders of magnitude faster than random access, and many sophisticated paradigms have been developed to design efficient algorithms based upon sequential and block access. Another way to reduce the I/O bottleneck is to use multiple disks in parallel in order to increase the bandwidth between primary and secondary memory.<ref>[[J. S. Vitter]], ''[http://www.ittc.ku.edu/~jsv/Papers/Vit.IO_book.pdf Algorithms and Data Structures for External Memory]'', Series on Foundations and Trends in Theoretical Computer Science, now Publishers, Hanover, MA,\n2008, ISBN 978-1-60198-106-6.</ref>\n\nSome other examples of secondary storage technologies are [[flash memory]] (e.g. [[USB flash drive]]s or keys), [[floppy disk]]s, [[Magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tape]], [[Punched tape|paper tape]], [[punched card]]s, standalone [[RAM disk]]s, and [[Iomega Zip drive]]s.\n\nThe secondary storage is often formatted according to a [[file system]] format, which provides the abstraction necessary to organize data into [[Computer file|files]] and [[Directory (computing)|directories]], providing also additional information (called [[metadata]]) describing the owner of a certain file, the access time, the access permissions, and other information.\n\nMost computer [[operating system]]s use the concept of [[virtual memory]], allowing utilization of more primary storage capacity than is physically available in the system. As the primary memory fills up, the system moves the least-used chunks (''[[page (computing)|pages]]'') to secondary storage devices (to a [[Paging|swap file]] or [[paging|page file]]), retrieving them later when they are needed. As more of these retrievals from slower secondary storage are necessary, the more the overall system performance is degraded.\n\n=== Tertiary storage ===\n<!-- Note that additional DIRECT links point to this section by its name. -->\n{{See also|Nearline storage|Cloud storage}}\n[[File:StorageTek Powderhorn tape library.jpg|thumb|A large [[tape library]], with tape cartridges placed on shelves in the front, and a robotic arm moving in the back. Visible height of the library is about 180&nbsp;cm.]]\n\n''Tertiary storage'' or ''tertiary memory''<ref>[http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1994/CSD-94-847.pdf A thesis on Tertiary storage]. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2011-06-18.</ref> provides a third level of storage. Typically, it involves a robotic mechanism which will ''mount'' (insert) and ''dismount'' removable mass storage media into a storage device according to the system's demands; this data is often copied to secondary storage before use. It is primarily used for archiving rarely accessed information since it is much slower than secondary storage (e.g. 5\u201360 seconds vs. 1\u201310 milliseconds). This is primarily useful for extraordinarily large data stores, accessed without human operators. Typical examples include [[tape library|tape libraries]] and [[optical jukebox]]es.\n\nWhen a computer needs to read information from the tertiary storage, it will first consult a catalog [[database]] to determine which tape or disc contains the information. Next, the computer will instruct a [[industrial robot|robotic arm]] to fetch the medium and place it in a drive. When the computer has finished reading the information, the robotic arm will return the medium to its place in the library.\n\nTertiary storage is also known as ''[[nearline storage]]'' because it is \"near to online\". The formal distinction between online, nearline, and offline storage is:<ref name=\"pearson2010\">{{cite web |last=Pearson |first=Tony |year=2010 |url=https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/InsideSystemStorage/entry/the_correct_use_of_the_term_nearline2 |title=Correct use of the term Nearline. |work=IBM Developerworks, Inside System Storage |accessdate=2015-08-16}}</ref>\n* Online storage is immediately available for I/O.\n* Nearline storage is not immediately available, but can be made online quickly without human intervention.\n* Offline storage is not immediately available, and requires some human intervention to become online.\n\nFor example, always-on spinning hard disk drives are online storage, while spinning drives that spin down automatically, such as in massive arrays of idle disks ([[MAID]]), are nearline storage. Removable media such as tape cartridges that can be automatically loaded, as in [[Tape library|tape libraries]], are nearline storage, while tape cartridges that must be manually loaded are offline storage.\n\n=== Off-line storage ===\n<!-- Additional DIRECT links point to this section by name. -->\n''Off-line storage'' is a computer data storage on a medium or a device that is not under the control of a [[central processing unit|processing unit]].<ref>{{Cite journal\n  | last =  National Communications System\n  | author-link = National Communications System\n  | title = Federal Standard 1037C \u2013 Telecommunications: Glossary of Telecommunication Terms\n  | publisher = General Services Administration\n  | year = 1996\n  | id = FS-1037C\n  | url = http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/fs-1037c.htm\n  | accessdate = 2007-10-08\n  | postscript =  <!--None-->\n}} See also article [[Federal Standard 1037C]].</ref> The medium is recorded, usually in a secondary or tertiary storage device, and then physically removed or disconnected. It must be inserted or connected by a human operator before a computer can access it again. Unlike tertiary storage, it cannot be accessed without human interaction.\n\n[[Online and offline|Off-line]] storage is used to [[Data transmission|transfer information]], since the detached medium can be easily physically transported. Additionally, in case a disaster, for example a fire, destroys the original data, a medium in a remote location will probably be unaffected, enabling [[disaster recovery]]. Off-line storage increases general [[information security]], since it is physically inaccessible from a computer, and data confidentiality or integrity cannot be affected by computer-based attack techniques. Also, if the information stored for archival purposes is rarely accessed, off-line storage is less expensive than tertiary storage.\n\nIn modern personal computers, most secondary and tertiary storage media are also used for off-line storage. Optical discs and flash memory devices are most popular, and to much lesser extent removable hard disk drives. In enterprise uses, magnetic tape is predominant. Older examples are floppy disks, Zip disks, or punched cards.\n\n== Characteristics of storage ==\n[[File:DDR RAM-2.jpg|thumb|250px|A 1GB DDR [[Random-access memory|RAM]] module (detail)]]\n\nStorage technologies at all levels of the storage hierarchy can be differentiated by evaluating certain core characteristics as well as measuring characteristics specific to a particular implementation. These core characteristics are volatility, mutability, accessibility, and addressability. For any particular implementation of any storage technology, the characteristics worth measuring are capacity and performance.\n\n=== Volatility ===\n[[Non-volatile memory]] retains the stored information even if not constantly supplied with electric power.<ref name=\"flashnvmWork\">\"[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277637285_A_Survey_of_Software_Techniques_for_Using_Non-Volatile_Memories_for_Storage_and_Main_Memory_Systems A Survey of Software Techniques for Using Non-Volatile Memories for Storage and Main Memory Systems]\", IEEE TPDS, 2015</ref> It is suitable for long-term storage of information. [[Volatile memory]] requires constant power to maintain the stored information. The fastest memory technologies are volatile ones, although that is not a universal rule. Since the primary storage is required to be very fast, it predominantly uses volatile memory.\n\n[[Dynamic random-access memory]] is a form of volatile memory that also requires the stored information to be periodically reread and rewritten, or [[memory refresh|refreshed]], otherwise it would vanish. [[Static random-access memory]] is a form of volatile memory similar to DRAM with the exception that it never needs to be refreshed as long as power is applied; it loses its content when the power supply is lost.\n\nAn [[uninterruptible power supply]] (UPS) can be used to give a computer a brief window of time to move information from primary volatile storage into non-volatile storage before the batteries are exhausted.  Some systems, for example [[EMC Symmetrix]], have integrated batteries that maintain volatile storage for several minutes.\n\n=== Mutability ===\n; Read/write storage or mutable storage : Allows information to be overwritten at any time. A computer without some amount of read/write storage for primary storage purposes would be useless for many tasks. Modern computers typically use read/write storage also for secondary storage.\n; Read only storage : Retains the information stored at the time of manufacture, and ''write once storage'' ([[Write Once Read Many]]) allows the information to be written only once at some point after manufacture. These are called ''immutable storage''. Immutable storage is used for tertiary and off-line storage. Examples include [[CD-ROM]] and [[CD-R]].\n; Slow write, fast read storage : Read/write storage which allows information to be overwritten multiple times, but with the write operation being much slower than the read operation. Examples include [[CD-RW]] and [[swayne memory]]\n\n=== Accessibility ===\n; [[Random access]]: Any location in storage can be accessed at any moment in approximately the same amount of time. Such characteristic is well suited for primary and secondary storage. Most semiconductor memories and disk drives provide random access.\n; [[Sequential access]]: The accessing of pieces of information will be in a serial order, one after the other; therefore the time to access a particular piece of information depends upon which piece of information was last accessed. Such characteristic is typical of off-line storage.\n\n=== Addressability ===\n; Location-addressable : Each individually accessible unit of information in storage is selected with its numerical [[memory address]]. In modern computers, location-addressable storage usually limits to primary storage, accessed internally by computer programs, since location-addressability is very efficient, but burdensome for humans.\n; [[file system|File addressable]]: Information is divided into ''[[computer file|files]]'' of variable length, and a particular file is selected with [[human-readable]] directory and file names. The underlying device is still location-addressable, but the [[operating system]] of a computer provides the file system [[abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]] to make the operation more understandable. In modern computers, secondary, tertiary and off-line storage use file systems.\n; [[content-addressable memory|Content-addressable]]: Each individually accessible unit of information is selected based on the basis of (part of) the contents stored there. Content-addressable storage can be implemented using [[software]] (computer program) or [[Personal computer hardware|hardware]] (computer device), with hardware being faster but more expensive option. Hardware content addressable memory is often used in a computer's [[CPU cache]].\n\n=== Capacity ===\n; Raw capacity : The total amount of stored information that a storage device or medium can hold. It is expressed as a quantity of [[bit]]s or [[byte]]s (e.g. 10.4 [[megabyte]]s).\n; [[Memory storage density]]: The compactness of stored information. It is the storage capacity of a medium divided with a unit of length, area or volume (e.g. 1.2 megabytes per square inch).\n\n=== Performance ===\n; [[Latency (engineering)|Latency]]: The time it takes to access a particular location in storage. The relevant [[units of measurement|unit of measurement]] is typically [[1 E-9 s|nanosecond]] for primary storage, [[millisecond]] for secondary storage, and [[second]] for tertiary storage. It may make sense to separate read latency and write latency (especially for non-volatile memory<ref name=\"flashnvmWork\"/>) and in case of sequential access storage, minimum, maximum and average latency.\n; [[Throughput]]: The rate at which information can be read from or written to the storage. In computer data storage, throughput is usually expressed in terms of megabytes per second (MB/s), though [[bit rate]] may also be used. As with latency, read rate and write rate may need to be differentiated. Also accessing media sequentially, as opposed to randomly, typically yields maximum throughput.\n; Granularity: The size of the largest \"chunk\" of data that can be efficiently accessed as a single unit, e.g. without introducing additional latency.\n;Reliability: The probability of spontaneous bit value change under various conditions, or overall [[failure rate]].\n\n=== Energy use ===\n* Storage devices that reduce fan usage, automatically shut-down during inactivity, and low power hard drives can reduce energy consumption by 90 percent.<ref>[http://www.springlightcfl.com/consumer/energy_savings_calculator.aspx Energy Savings Calculator] and [http://www.simpletech.com/content/eco-friendly-redrive Fabric website]</ref>\n* 2.5 inch hard disk drives often consume less power than larger ones.<ref>{{cite web| title=IS the Silent PC Future 2.5-inches wide?|url=http://www.silentpcreview.com/article145-page1.html|accessdate=2008-08-02|author=Mike Chin|date=8 March 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.silentpcreview.com/article29-page2.html|title=Recommended Hard Drives|accessdate=2008-08-02|author=Mike Chin|date=2002-09-18}}</ref> Low capacity [[solid-state drive]]s have no moving parts and consume less power than hard disks.<ref>[http://techreport.com/articles.x/10334/13 Super Talent's 2.5\" IDE Flash hard drive \u2013 The Tech Report \u2013 Page 13].

''Media'' is a common name for what actually holds the data in the storage device. Some other fundamental storage technologies have also been used in the past or are proposed for development.\n\n=== Semiconductor ===\n[[Semiconductor memory]] uses [[semiconductor]]-based [[integrated circuit]]s to store information. A semiconductor memory chip may contain millions of tiny [[transistor]]s or [[capacitor]]s. Both ''volatile'' and ''non-volatile'' forms of semiconductor memory exist. In modern computers, primary storage almost exclusively consists of dynamic volatile semiconductor memory or [[dynamic random-access memory]]. Since the turn of the century, a type of non-volatile semiconductor memory known as [[flash memory]] has steadily gained share as off-line storage for home computers. Non-volatile semiconductor memory is also used for secondary storage in various advanced electronic devices and specialized computers that are designed for them.\n\nAs early as 2006, [[Laptop|notebook]] and [[desktop computer]] manufacturers started using flash-based [[solid-state drive]]s (SSDs) as default configuration options for the secondary storage either in addition to or instead of the more traditional HDD.<ref>[http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,1966644,00.asp New Samsung Notebook Replaces Hard Drive With Flash].

Magnetic storage is ''non-volatile''. The information is accessed using one or more read/write heads which may contain one or more recording transducers. A read/write head only covers a part of the surface so that the head or medium or both must be moved relative to another in order to access data. In modern computers, magnetic storage will take these forms:\n* [[Disk storage|Magnetic disk]]\n** [[Floppy disk]], used for off-line storage\n** [[Hard disk drive]], used for secondary storage\n* [[Magnetic tape data storage|Magnetic tape]], used for tertiary and off-line storage\n* [[Carousel memory]] (magnetic rolls)\n\nIn early computers, magnetic storage was also used as:\n*Primary storage in a form of [[Drum memory|magnetic memory]], or [[Magnetic core memory|core memory]], [[core rope memory]], [[thin-film memory]] and/or [[twistor memory]].\n*Tertiary (e.g. [[NCR CRAM]]) or off line storage in the form of magnetic cards.\n*Magnetic tape was then often used for secondary storage.\n\n=== Optical ===\n{{Optical storage media}}\n\n[[Optical storage]], the typical [[optical disc]], stores information in deformities on the surface of a circular disc and reads this information by illuminating the surface with a [[laser diode]] and observing the reflection. Optical disc storage is ''non-volatile''. The deformities may be permanent (read only media), formed once (write once media) or reversible (recordable or read/write media). The following forms are currently in common use:<ref>The [http://www.dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html DVD FAQ] is a comprehensive reference of DVD technologies.</ref>\n* [[Compact Disc|CD]], [[CD-ROM]], [[DVD]], [[Blu-ray Disc|BD-ROM]]: Read only storage, used for mass distribution of digital information (music, video, computer programs)\n* [[CD-R]], [[DVD-R]], [[DVD+R]], [[Blu-ray Disc recordable|BD-R]]: Write once storage, used for tertiary and off-line storage\n* [[CD-RW]], [[DVD-RW]], [[DVD+RW]], [[DVD-RAM]], [[Blu-ray Disc recordable|BD-RE]]: Slow write, fast read storage, used for tertiary and off-line storage\n* [[Ultra Density Optical]] or UDO is similar in capacity to [[Blu-ray Disc recordable|BD-R or BD-RE]] and is slow write, fast read storage used for tertiary and off-line storage.\n\n[[Magneto-optical drive|Magneto-optical disc storage]] is optical disc storage where the magnetic state on a [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] surface stores information. The information is read optically and written by combining magnetic and optical methods. Magneto-optical disc storage is ''non-volatile'', ''sequential access'', slow write, fast read storage used for tertiary and off-line storage.\n\n[[3D optical data storage]] has also been proposed.\n\nLight induced magnetization melting in magnetic photoconductors has also been proposed for high-speed low-energy consumption magneto-optical storage.<ref name=\"N\u00e1fr\u00e1di 2016\">{{cite journal|last1=N\u00e1fr\u00e1di|first1=B\u00e1lint|title=Optically switched magnetism in photovoltaic perovskite CH3NH3(Mn:Pb)I3|journal=Nature Communications|date=24 November 2016|volume=7|page=13406|doi=10.1038/ncomms13406|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13406}}</ref>\n\n=== Paper ===\n{{Paper data storage media}}\n\n[[Paper data storage]], typically in the form of [[punched tape|paper tape]] or [[punched card]]s, has long been used to store information for automatic processing, particularly before general-purpose computers existed. Information was recorded by punching holes into the paper or cardboard medium and was read mechanically (or later optically) to determine whether a particular location on the medium was solid or contained a hole.\nA few technologies allow people to make marks on paper that are easily read by machine\u2014these are widely used for tabulating votes and grading standardized tests. [[Barcode]]s made it possible for any object that was to be sold or transported to have some computer readable information securely attached to it.\n\n=== Other storage media or substrates ===\n; Vacuum tube memory : A [[Williams tube]] used a [[cathode ray tube]], and a [[Selectron tube]] used a large [[vacuum tube]] to store information. These primary storage devices were short-lived in the market, since Williams tube was unreliable and the Selectron tube was expensive.\n\n; Electro-acoustic memory : [[Delay line memory]] used [[Longitudinal wave|sound wave]]s in a substance such as [[mercury (element)|mercury]] to store information. Delay line memory was dynamic volatile, cycle sequential read/write storage, and was used for primary storage.\n\n; [[Optical tape]]: is a medium for optical storage generally consisting of a long and narrow strip of plastic onto which patterns can be written and from which the patterns can be read back. It shares some technologies with cinema film stock and optical discs, but is compatible with neither. The motivation behind developing this technology was the possibility of far greater storage capacities than either magnetic tape or optical discs.\n\n; [[Phase-change memory]]: uses different mechanical phases of [[Phase Change Material]] to store information in an X-Y addressable matrix, and reads the information by observing the varying [[electrical resistance]] of the material. Phase-change memory would be non-volatile, random-access read/write storage, and might be used for primary, secondary and off-line storage. Most rewritable and many write once optical disks already use phase change material to store information.\n\n; [[Holographic data storage]]: stores information optically inside [[crystal]]s or [[photopolymer]]s. Holographic storage can utilize the whole volume of the storage medium, unlike optical disc storage which is limited to a small number of surface layers. Holographic storage would be non-volatile, sequential access, and either write once or read/write storage. It might be used for secondary and off-line storage. See [[Holographic Versatile Disc]] (HVD).\n\n; [[Molecular memory]]: stores information in [[polymer]] that can store electric charge. Molecular memory might be especially suited for primary storage. The theoretical storage capacity of molecular memory is 10 terabits per square inch.<ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090219141438.htm New Method Of Self-assembling Nanoscale Elements Could Transform Data Storage Industry].

The following solutions are commonly used and valid for most storage devices:\n* '''Device [[Disk mirroring|mirroring]] (replication)''' \u2013 A common solution to the problem is constantly maintaining an identical copy of device content on another device (typically of a same type). The downside is that this doubles the storage, and both devices (copies) need to be updated simultaneously with some overhead and possibly some delays. The upside is possible concurrent read of a same data group by two independent processes, which increases performance. When one of the replicated devices is detected to be defective, the other copy is still operational, and is being utilized to generate a new copy on another device (usually available operational in a pool of stand-by devices for this purpose).\n* '''Redundant array of independent disks''' ('''[[RAID]]''') \u2013 This method generalizes the device mirroring above by allowing one device in a group of N devices to fail and be replaced with the content restored (Device mirroring is RAID with N=2). RAID groups of N=5 or N=6 are common. N>2 saves storage, when comparing with N=2, at the cost of more processing during both regular operation (with often reduced performance) and defective device replacement.\n\nDevice mirroring and typical RAID are designed to handle a single device failure in the RAID group of devices. However, if a second failure occurs before the RAID group is completely repaired from the first failure, then data can be lost. The probability of a single failure is typically small. Thus the probability of two failures in a same RAID group in time proximity is much smaller (approximately the probability squared, i.e., multiplied by itself). If a database cannot tolerate even such smaller probability of data loss, then the RAID group itself is replicated (mirrored). In many cases such mirroring is done geographically remotely, in a different storage array, to handle also recovery from disasters (see disaster recovery above).\n\n=== Network connectivity ===\nA secondary or tertiary storage may connect to a computer utilizing [[computer network]]s.\nThis concept does not pertain to the primary storage, which is shared between multiple processors to a lesser degree.\n* [[Direct-attached storage]] (DAS) is a traditional mass storage, that does not use any network. This is still a most popular approach. This [[retronym]] was coined recently, together with NAS and SAN.\n* [[Network-attached storage]] (NAS) is mass storage attached to a computer which another computer can access at file level over a [[local area network]], a private [[wide area network]], or in the case of [[File hosting service|online file storage]], over the [[Internet]]. NAS is commonly associated with the [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]] and [[Server Message Block|CIFS/SMB]] protocols.\n* [[Storage area network]] (SAN) is a specialized network, that provides other computers with storage capacity. The crucial difference between NAS and SAN is the former presents and manages file systems to client computers, whilst the latter provides access at block-addressing (raw) level, leaving it to attaching systems to manage data or file systems within the provided capacity. SAN is commonly associated with [[Fibre Channel]] networks.\n\n=== Robotic storage ===\nLarge quantities of individual magnetic tapes, and optical or magneto-optical discs may be stored in robotic tertiary storage devices. In tape storage field they are known as [[tape library|tape libraries]], and in optical storage field [[optical jukebox]]es, or optical disk libraries per analogy. Smallest forms of either technology containing just one drive device are referred to as [[autoloader (data storage device)|autoloaders]] or [[autochanger]]s.\n\nRobotic-access storage devices may have a number of slots, each holding individual media, and usually one or more picking robots that traverse the slots and load media to built-in drives. The arrangement of the slots and picking devices affects performance. Important characteristics of such storage are possible expansion options: adding slots, modules, drives, robots. Tape libraries may have from 10 to more than 100,000 slots, and provide [[terabyte]]s or [[petabyte]]s of near-line information. Optical jukeboxes are somewhat smaller solutions, up to 1,000 slots.\n\nRobotic storage is used for [[backup]]s, and for high-capacity archives in imaging, medical, and video industries. [[Hierarchical storage management]] is a most known archiving strategy of automatically ''migrating'' long-unused files from fast hard disk storage to libraries or jukeboxes. If the files are needed, they are ''retrieved'' back to disk.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Computer memory}}\n{{Wikiversity | Computer data storage}}\n\n=== Primary storage topics ===\n* [[Aperture (computer memory)]]\n* [[Dynamic random-access memory]] (DRAM)\n* [[CAS latency|Memory latency]]\n* [[Mass storage]]\n* [[Memory cell (disambiguation)]] <!-- do not remove - disambig of redirect -->\n* [[Memory management]]\n** [[Dynamic memory allocation]]\n*** [[Memory leak]]\n** [[Virtual memory]]\n* [[Memory protection]]\n* [[Page address register]]\n* [[Static random-access memory]] (SRAM)\n* [[Stable storage]]\n\n=== Secondary, tertiary and off-line storage topics ===\n* [[Cloud storage]]\n* [[Data deduplication]]\n* [[Data proliferation]]\n* [[Data storage tag]] used for capturing research data\n* [[File system]]\n** [[List of file formats]]\n* [[Flash memory]]\n* [[Information repository]]\n* [[Removable media]]\n* [[Solid-state drive]]\n* [[Spindle (computer)|Spindle]]\n* [[Virtual tape library]]\n* [[Wait state]]\n* [[Write buffer]]\n* [[Write protection]]\n* [[Noise-predictive maximum-likelihood detection]]\n* [[Object storage|Object(-based) storage]]\n\n=== Data storage conferences ===\n* [[Storage Networking World]]\n* [[Storage World Conference]]\n* [http://static.usenix.org/events/fast/ USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies]\n\n== References ==\n{{FS1037C}}\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite journal|title=The History of Storage Systems|journal=[[Proceedings of the IEEE]]|author1=Goda, K. |author2=Kitsuregawa, M. |year=2012|pages=1433\u20131440|volume=100|doi=10.1109/JPROC.2012.2189787}}\n*[http://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/memory-storage/8 Memory & Storage], Computer History Museum\n\n{{Primary storage technologies}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2011}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Computer Data Storage}}\n[[Category:Computer data storage| ]]\n[[Category:Computer architecture]]"}]}}}}
