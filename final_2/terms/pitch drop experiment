Pitch is the name for any of a number of highly [[Viscosity|viscous]] liquids that appear solid, most commonly [[bitumen]]. At room temperature, tar pitch flows at a very low rate, taking several years to form a single drop.\n\n== University of Queensland experiment ==\n[[Image:Pitch drop experiment with John Mainstone.jpg|thumb|left|The [[University of Queensland]] pitch drop experiment, featuring its then-current custodian, Professor John Mainstone (taken in 1990, two years after the seventh drop and 10&nbsp;years before the eighth drop fell).]]\nThe best known version<ref name=BBC1 /> of the [[experiment]] was started in 1927 by [[Thomas Parnell (scientist)|Professor Thomas Parnell]] of the [[University of Queensland]] in [[Brisbane]], Australia, to demonstrate to students that some substances that appear to be solid are in fact very-high-viscosity fluids. Parnell poured a heated sample of pitch into a sealed [[funnel]] and allowed it to settle for three years. In 1930, the seal at the neck of the funnel was cut, allowing the pitch to start flowing.  A glass dome covers the funnel and it is placed on display outside a lecture theatre.<ref name=\"pife\">{{Cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/pitch-fever/story-e6frg8h6-1226613215795 |title=Pitch fever |author=Trent Dalton |accessdate=9 July 2013 |date=6 April 2013 |newspaper=The Australian |publisher=News Limited }}</ref>  Large droplets form and fall over a period of about a [[decade]].\n\nThe eighth drop fell on 28&nbsp;November 2000, allowing experimenters to calculate that the pitch has a [[viscosity]] approximately 230&nbsp;billion (2.3{{e|11}}) times that of [[water]].<ref name=pitchdrop>{{cite web | last = Edgeworth | first = R., Dalton, B.J. & Parnell, T. | url = http://www.physics.uq.edu.au/physics_museum/pitchdrop.shtml | accessdate = 2007-10-15 | title = The Pitch Drop Experiment }}</ref>\n\nThis is recorded in [[Guinness World Records]] as the world's longest continuously running laboratory experiment,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Pitch Drop Experiment|url=http://smp.uq.edu.au/content/pitch-drop-experiment|website=The University of Queensland Australia: School of Mathematics and Physics|accessdate=17 August 2016}}</ref> and it is expected that there is enough pitch in the funnel to allow it to continue for at least another hundred years. This experiment is predated by two other still-active scientific devices, the [[Oxford Electric Bell]] (1840) and the [[Beverly Clock]] (1864), but each of these has experienced brief interruptions since 1937.\n\nThe experiment was not originally carried out under any special controlled atmospheric conditions, meaning that the viscosity could vary throughout the year with fluctuations in [[temperature]].  Some time after the seventh drop fell in 1988, air conditioning was added to the location where the experiment takes place. The lower average temperature has lengthened each drop's stretch before it separates from the rest of the pitch in the funnel.\n\nIn October 2005, [[John Mainstone]] and the late [[Thomas Parnell (scientist)|Thomas Parnell]] were awarded the [[Ig Nobel Prize]] in Physics, a parody of the [[Nobel Prize]], for the pitch drop experiment.<ref>[http://improbable.com/ig/winners/#ig2005 The 2005 Ig Nobel Prize Winners].

This experiment, like the one at Queensland University, was set up to demonstrate the high viscosity of pitch. This physics experiment sat on a shelf in a lecture hall at Trinity College unmonitored for decades as it dripped a number of times from the funnel to the receiving jar below, also gathering layers of dust.<ref\nname=\"Johnson_Nature\" >\n{{cite web \n | last = Johnston\n | first = Richard\n | title = World's slowest-moving drop caught on camera at last\n | publisher = [[Nature Publishing Group]]\n | date = 18 July 2013\n | url = http://www.nature.com/news/world-s-slowest-moving-drop-caught-on-camera-at-last-1.13418\n | accessdate = 15 March 2014\n}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n | title = Trinity College experiment succeeds after 69 years\n | publisher = [[RT\u00c9 News|RT\u00c9 News, Ireland]]\n | date = 19 July 2013\n | url = http://www.rte.ie/news/2013/0717/463097-trinity-college-dublin-pitch-experiment/\n | accessdate = 19 July 2013\n}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n | last =  Garber\n | first =  Megan \n | authorlink =\n | title = The 3 Most Exciting Words in Science Right Now: 'The Pitch Dropped'\n | publisher = [[The Atlantic]]\n | date = 18 July 2013 \n | url = http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/07/the-3-most-exciting-words-in-science-right-now-the-pitch-dropped/277919/\n | accessdate = 19 July 2013\n}}\n</ref>\n\nIn April 2013, about a decade after the previous pitch drop, physicists at Trinity College noticed that another drip was forming. They moved the experiment to a table to monitor and record the falling drip with a webcam, allowing all present to watch.  The pitch dripped around 5:00pm on 11 July 2013, marking the first time that a pitch drop was successfully recorded on camera.\n\nBased on the results from this experiment, the Trinity College physicists estimated that the viscosity of the pitch is about two million times that of honey, or about 20 billion times the viscosity of water.<ref name=\"Johnson_Nature\" />\n\n==Experiment at Aberystwyth University in Wales==\nIt is reported that a pitch drop experiment has been recently rediscovered at [[Aberystwyth University]] in Wales. Dating from 1914, it predates the Queensland experiment by 13 years. But as the pitch is more viscous (or the average temperature lower) this experiment has not yet produced its first drop.<ref name=BBC1>{{cite web|last1=Webb|first1=Jonathan|title=Tedium, tragedy and tar: The slowest drops in science|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-28402709|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2014-07-26}}</ref><ref name=DigitalPC>{{cite web|last1=Shane D Bergin|last2=Stefan Hutzler|last3=Denis Weaire|title=The drop heard round the world|url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/indepth/2014/may/01/the-drop-heard-round-the-world|accessdate=26 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Demonstrations of Lord Kelvin ==\n\nIn the Hunterian Museum at the [[University of Glasgow]] are two pitch-demonstrations by [[Lord Kelvin]] from the 19th century. Kelvin placed on top of a dish of pitch some bullets, and corks at the bottom: over time, the bullets sank and the corks floated.\n\nLord Kelvin also showed that the pitch flows like [[glacier]]s, with a mahogany ramp that allowed it to slide slowly downward and form similar shapes and patterns to rivers of ice in the Alps.<ref name=BBC1/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Queensland|Ireland|Science}}\n* [[Rheology]]\n* [[William James Beal]], Botanist who started a long-running seed germination experiment in 1879\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* [http://smp.uq.edu.au/content/pitch-drop-experiment Experiment at University of Queensland] (also live webcam)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140316200312/http://www.physics.uq.edu.au/physics_museum/pitch2.gif Experiment at University of Queensland - picture of the sixth drop shortly after falling] (Archive.org)\n* [http://physics.tcd.ie/tar-experiment/ Experiment at Trinity College, Dublin] (also video of the drop falling)\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2011}}\n\n[[Category:Fluid dynamics]]\n[[Category:Physics experiments]]\n[[Category:History of physics]]\n[[Category:University of Queensland]]\n[[Category:Trinity College, Dublin]]"}]}}}}
