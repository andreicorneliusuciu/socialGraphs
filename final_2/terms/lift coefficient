A lifting body is a [[foil (fluid mechanics)|foil]] or a complete foil-bearing body such as a [[fixed-wing aircraft]]. ''C''<sub>L</sub> is a function of the angle of the body to the flow, its [[Reynold number]] and its [[Mach number]]. The lift coefficient ''c''<sub>l</sub> refers to the dynamic lift characteristics of a [[two-dimensional]] foil section, with the reference area replaced by the foil [[Chord (aircraft)|chord]].<ref name=Clancy>{{cite book|last=Clancy|first=L.

Section 4.15</ref>\n\n:<math>C_\\mathrm L \\equiv \\frac{L}{q \\, S} = {\\frac{L}{\\frac{1}{2}\\rho u^2 \\, S}} = {\\frac{2 L}{\\rho u^2S}} </math> ,\nwhere \n<math>L\\,</math> is the [[Lift (force)|lift force]], <math>S\\,</math> is the relevant plan area and <math>q\\,</math> is the fluid [[dynamic pressure]], in turn linked to the [[fluid]] [[density]] <math>\\rho\\,</math>, and to the [[flow speed]] <math>u\\,</math>. The choice of the reference surface should be specified since it is arbitrary. For example, for an cylindric profiles (the 3D extrusion of and airfoil in the spanwise direction) it is always oriented in the spanwise direction, but while in aerodynamics and thin airfoil theory the second axis generating the surface is commonly the chordwise direction:\n\n:<math>S_{aer} \\equiv c \\, s</math>\n\nresulting in a coeffient:\n\n:<math>C_{\\mathrm L, \\, aer} \\equiv \\frac{L}{q \\, c \\, s} </math>\n\n, for thick airfoils and in marine dynamics the other axis sometimes one choose as the second axis the thickness direction:\n\n:<math>S_{mar} = t \\, s</math>\n\nresulting in a different coeffient:\n\n:<math>C_{\\mathrm L, \\, mar} \\equiv \\frac{L}{q \\, t \\, s} </math>\n\nThe ratio between these two coeffients is the thickness ratio:\n\n:<math>C_{\\mathrm L, \\, mar} \\equiv \\frac c t C_{\\mathrm L, \\, aer} </math>\n\nThe lift coefficient can be approximated using the [[lifting-line theory]],<ref>Clancy, L. J.: ''Aerodynamics''. Section 8.11</ref> numerically calculated  or measured in a [[wind tunnel]] test of a complete aircraft configuration.\n\n== Section lift coefficient ==\n[[Image:Lift curve.svg|thumb|300px|right|A typical curve showing section lift coefficient versus angle of attack for a cambered airfoil]]\nLift coefficient may also be used as a characteristic of a particular shape (or cross-section) of an [[airfoil]].  In this application it is called the '''section lift coefficient''' <math>c_\\text{l}</math>. It is common to show, for a particular airfoil section, the relationship between section lift coefficient and [[angle of attack]].<ref>Abbott, Ira H., and Von Doenhoff, Albert E.: ''Theory of Wing Sections''. Appendix IV</ref> It is also useful to show the relationship between section lift coefficient and [[drag coefficient]].\n\nThe section lift coefficient is based on two-dimensional flow over a wing of infinite span and non-varying cross-section so the lift is independent of spanwise effects and is defined in terms of <math>l</math>, the lift force per unit span of the wing.  The definition becomes\n\n:<math>c_\\text{l} = \\frac{l}{q \\, L},</math>\n\nwhere L is the reference length that should always be specified: in aerodynamics and airfoil theory usually the airfoil [[chord (aircraft)|chord]] <math>c\\,</math> is chosen, while in marine dynamics and for struts usually the thickness <math>t\\,</math> is chosen. Note this is directly analogous to the drag coefficient since the chord can be interpreted as the \"area per unit span\".\n\nFor a given angle of attack, ''c''<sub>l</sub> can be calculated approximately using the [[thin airfoil theory]],<ref>Clancy, L. J.: ''Aerodynamics''. Section 8.2</ref> calculated numerically or determined from wind tunnel tests on a finite-length test piece, with end-plates designed to ameliorate the three-dimensional effects. Plots of ''c''<sub>l</sub> versus angle of attack  show the same general shape for all [[airfoil]]s, but the particular numbers will vary. They show an almost linear increase in lift coefficient with increasing [[angle of attack]] with a gradient known as the lift slope.  For a thin airfoil of any shape the lift slope is \u03c0<sup>2</sup>/90 \u2243 0.11 per degree. At higher angles a maximum point is reached, after which the lift coefficient reduces. The angle at which maximum lift coefficient occurs is the [[Stall (flight)|stall]] angle of the airfoil, which is approximately 10 to 15 degrees on a typical airfoil.\n\nSymmetric airfoils necessarily have plots of c<sub>l</sub> versus angle of attack symmetric about the ''c''<sub>l</sub> axis, but for any airfoil with positive [[camber (aerodynamics)|camber]], i.e. asymmetrical, convex from above, there is still a small but positive lift coefficient with angles of attack less than zero. That is, the angle at which ''c''<sub>l</sub> = 0 is negative. On such airfoils at zero angle of attack the pressures on the upper surface are lower than on the lower surface.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Lift-to-drag ratio]]\n* [[Drag coefficient]]\n* [[Foil (fluid mechanics)]]\n* [[Pitching moment]]\n* [[Circulation control wing]]\n* [[Zero lift axis]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* Clancy, L.
