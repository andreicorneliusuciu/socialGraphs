The name is a [[three letter acronym]] for ''DataBase Manager'', and can also refer to the family of database engines with APIs and features derived from the original ''dbm''.\n\nThe ''dbm'' library stores arbitrary data by use of a single key (a [[primary key]]) in fixed-size [[bucket (computing)|buckets]] and uses [[hash function|hashing]] techniques to enable fast retrieval of the data by key. \n\nThe hashing scheme used is a form of [[extendible hashing]], so that the hashing scheme expands as new buckets are added to the database, meaning that, when nearly empty, the database starts with one bucket, which is then split when it becomes full. The two resulting child buckets will themselves split when they become full, so the database grows as keys are added.\n\nThe ''dbm'' library and its derivatives are pre-[[relational database]]s{{snd}} they manage [[associative array]]s, implemented as on-disk [[hash table]]s. In practice, they can offer a more practical solution for high-speed storage accessed by key, as they do not require the overhead of connecting and preparing queries. This is balanced by the fact that they can generally only be opened for writing by a single process at a time. An agent [[Daemon_(computer_software)|daemon]] can handle requests from multiple processes, but introduces [[Inter-process communication|IPC]] overhead.\n\n== Successors ==\nThe ''dbm'' library has had many successors, such as:\n\n* [[Ndbm]]: In 1986 Berkeley produced ndbm (standing for ''New Database Manager''). This added support for having multiple databases open concurrently.\n* Sdbm: Some versions of Unix excluded ndbm due to licensing issues, so in 1987 [[Ozan Yigit]] produced this public-domain clone.<ref>{{cite web|author= Seltzer & Yigit|title= A New Hashing Package for Unix|url= http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/margo/papers/usenix91/paper.pdf}}</ref>\n* [[GDBM]] (GNU dbm): A Free/Libre version written by Philip A. Nelson for the [[GNU project]]. It added support for arbitrary-length data in the database: previously all data had a fixed maximum length.<ref>https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Gdbm</ref><ref>http://www.gnu.org.ua/software/gdbm/</ref> The last version was released on December 25, 2013.<ref> [http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2013-12/msg00012.html \u00ab gdbm-1.11 released \u00bb], ''lists.gnu.org'', December 25, 2013.</ref>\n* tdb (trivial database library): developed and used internally within the [[Samba (software)|Samba]] suite, implements an [[API]] inspired by GDBM but also supports multiple writers, released under the [[LGPL]] license.<ref>https://tdb.samba.org</ref>\n* tdbm: a version of ndbm with atomic transactions, in-memory databases, and other extensions, released under a BSD-style open source license.<ref>http://tdbm.dss.ca/</ref>\n* [[MDBM]]: [[Ndbm]] work-alike hashed database library based on sdbm which is based on Per-Aake Larson's Dynamic Hashing algorithms.<ref>https://github.com/yahoo/mdbm</ref><ref>http://yahoo.github.io/mdbm</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Embedded database]]\n* [[Mobile database]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vvuzDziOMeMC&pg=PT270 | title=Beginning Linux Programming | first1=Neil | last1=Matthew | first2=Richard | last2=Stones | publisher=Wiley | date=2008 | chapter=Databases}}\n* {{cite web|author=Brachman & Neufeld|title=TDBM: A DBM Library With Atomic Transactions|url=http://tdbm.dss.ca/papers/tdbm/usenix.pdf}}\n* {{cite web|author=Olson, Bostic & Seltzer|title=Berkeley DB|url=http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix99/full_papers/olson/olson.pdf}}\n{{refend}}\n\n[[Category:Database engines]]\n[[Category:Free database management systems]]\n[[Category:Structured storage]]"}]}}}}
