It is often a type of [[observational study]], although they can also be structured as longitudinal [[randomized experiment]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shadish|first1=William R.|last2=Cook|first2=Thomas D.|last3=Campbell|first3=Donald T.|title=Experimental and Quasi-Experimental Designs for Generalized Causal Inference|date=2002|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|location=Boston|isbn=0-395-61556-9|page=267|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\nLongitudinal studies are often used in psychology, to study developmental trends across the life span, and in [[sociology]], to study life events throughout lifetimes or generations. The reason for this is that unlike [[cross-sectional study|cross-sectional studies]], in which different individuals with the same characteristics are compared,<ref>Carlson, Neil and et al. \"Psychology the Science of Behavior\", p. 361. Pearson Canada, United States of America</ref> longitudinal studies track the same people and so the differences observed in those people are less likely to be the result of cultural differences across generations. Longitudinal studies thus make observing changes more accurate and are applied in various other fields. In medicine, the design is used to uncover predictors of certain diseases. In advertising, the design is used to identify the changes that advertising has produced in the attitudes and behaviors of those within the target audience who have seen the advertising campaign. Longitudinal studies allow [[social scientists]] to distinguish short from long-term phenomena, such as [[poverty]]. If the poverty rate is 10% at a point in time, this may mean that 10% of the population are always poor or that the whole population experiences poverty for 10% of the time. It is impossible to conclude which of these possibilities is the case by using one-off cross-sectional studies.\n\nWhen longitudinal studies are [[observational study|observational]], in the sense that they observe the state of the world without manipulating it, it has been argued that they may have less power to detect [[causality|causal relationships]] than [[experiment]]s. However, because of the repeated observation at the individual level, they have more power than cross-sectional observational studies, by virtue of being able to exclude time-invariant unobserved individual differences and also of observing the temporal order of events.<ref>{{cite journal |author= van der Krieke, L., Blaauw, F.J., Emerencia, A.C., Schenk, H.M., Slaets, J., Bos, E.H., de Jonge, P., Jeronimus, B.F.| year = 2016 | title = Temporal Dynamics of Health and Well-Being: A Crowdsourcing Approach to Momentary Assessments and Automated Generation of Personalized Feedback | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | url= http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/PSY.0000000000000378 |doi=10.1097/PSY.0000000000000378 | pmid=27551988 }}</ref> Some of the disadvantages of longitudinal study include the fact that they take a lot of time and are very expensive.
