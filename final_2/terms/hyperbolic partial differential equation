More precisely, the [[Cauchy problem]] can be locally solved for arbitrary initial data along any non-characteristic hypersurface.  Many of the equations of [[mechanics]] are hyperbolic, and so the study of hyperbolic equations is of substantial contemporary interest. The model hyperbolic equation is the [[wave equation]].  In one spatial dimension, this is\n:<math>u_{tt} - u_{xx} = 0.\\,</math>\nThe equation has the property that, if ''u'' and its first time derivative are arbitrarily specified initial data on the line ''t''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 (with sufficient smoothness properties), then there exists a solution for all time ''t''.\n\nThe solutions of hyperbolic equations are \"wave-like.\" If a disturbance is made in the initial data of a hyperbolic differential equation, then not every point of space feels the disturbance at once.  Relative to a fixed time coordinate, disturbances have a finite [[propagation speed]]. They travel along the [[method of characteristics|characteristics]] of the equation. This feature qualitatively distinguishes hyperbolic equations from [[elliptic partial differential equation]]s and [[parabolic partial differential equation]]s.  A perturbation of the initial (or boundary) data of an elliptic or parabolic equation is felt at once by essentially all points in the domain.\n\nAlthough the definition of hyperbolicity is fundamentally a qualitative one, there are precise criteria that depend on the particular kind of differential equation under consideration.  There is a well-developed theory for linear [[differential operators]], due to [[Lars G\u00e5rding]], in the context of [[microlocal analysis]].  Nonlinear differential equations are hyperbolic if their linearizations are hyperbolic in the sense of G\u00e5rding.  There is a somewhat different theory for first order systems of equations coming from systems of [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]]s.\n\n== Definition ==\nA partial differential equation is hyperbolic at a point ''P'' provided that the [[Cauchy problem]] is uniquely solvable in a neighborhood of ''P'' for any initial data given on a non-characteristic hypersurface passing through ''P''.<ref>Rozhdestvenskii</ref>  Here the prescribed initial data consist of all (transverse) derivatives of the function on the surface up to one less than the order of the differential equation.\n\n== Examples ==\n\nBy a linear change of variables, any equation of the form\n: <math> Au_{xx} + 2Bu_{xy} + Cu_{yy} + \\text{(lower order terms)} = 0 \\,</math>\nwith\n:<math> B^2 - A C > 0 \\,</math>\ncan be transformed to the [[wave equation]], apart from lower order terms which are inessential for the qualitative understanding of the equation.<ref>Evans 1998, p.400</ref>  This definition is analogous to the definition of a planar [[Hyperbola#Quadratic_equation|hyperbola]].\n\nThe one-dimensional [[wave equation]]:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} - c^2\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = 0</math>\n\nis an example of a hyperbolic equation. The two-dimensional and three-dimensional wave equations also fall into the category of hyperbolic PDE. This type of second-order hyperbolic partial differential equation may be transformed to a hyperbolic system of first-order differential equations.<ref>Evans 1998, p.402</ref>\n\n== Hyperbolic system of partial differential equations ==\n\nThe following is a system of <math>s</math> first order partial differential equations for <math>s</math> unknown [[function (mathematics)|function]]s <math> \\vec u = (u_1, \\ldots, u_s) </math>, <math> \\vec u =\\vec u (\\vec x,t)</math>, where <math>\\vec x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d</math>:\n\n:<math>(*) \\quad \\frac{\\partial \\vec u}{\\partial t}\n + \\sum_{j=1}^d \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j}\n \\vec {f^j} (\\vec u) = 0,\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\vec {f^j} \\in C^1(\\mathbb{R}^s, \\mathbb{R}^s), j = 1, \\ldots, d</math> are once [[Continuous function|continuously]] [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] functions, [[nonlinear]] in general.\n\nNext, for each <math>\\vec {f^j}</math> a [[Jacobian matrix]] <math>s \\times s</math> is defined\n\n:<math>A^j:=\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f_1^j}{\\partial u_1} & \\cdots & \\frac{\\partial f_1^j}{\\partial u_s} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial f_s^j}{\\partial u_1} & \\cdots &\n\\frac{\\partial f_s^j}{\\partial u_s}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n,\\text{ for }j = 1, \\ldots, d.</math>\n\nThe system <math>(*)</math> is '''hyperbolic''' if for all <math>\\alpha_1, \\ldots, \\alpha_d \\in \\mathbb{R}</math> the matrix <math>A := \\alpha_1 A^1 + \\cdots + \\alpha_d A^d</math>\nhas only [[Real number|real]] [[eigenvalue]]s and is [[Diagonalizable matrix|diagonalizable]].\n\nIf the matrix <math>A</math> has ''n'' ''distinct'' real eigenvalues, it follows that it's diagonalizable. In this case the system <math>(*)</math> is called '''strictly hyperbolic'''.\n\nIf the matrix <math>A</math> is symmetric, it follows that it's diagonalizable and the eigenvalues are real. In this case the system <math>(*)</math> is called '''symmetric hyperbolic'''.\n\n== Hyperbolic system and conservation laws ==\n\nThere is a connection between a hyperbolic system and a [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]]. Consider a hyperbolic system of one partial differential equation for one unknown function <math>u = u(\\vec x, t)</math>. Then the system <math>(*)</math> has the form\n\n:<math>(**) \\quad \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}\n + \\sum_{j=1}^d \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j}\n {f^j} (u) = 0.\n</math>\n\nHere, <math>u</math> can be interpreted as a quantity that moves around according to the [[flux]] given by <math>\\vec f = (f^1, \\ldots, f^d)</math>. To see that the quantity <math>u</math> is conserved, [[Integral|integrate]] <math>(**)</math> over a domain <math>\\Omega</math>\n\n:<math>\\int_{\\Omega} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} d\\Omega + \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla \\cdot \\vec f(u) d\\Omega = 0.</math>\n\nIf <math>u</math> and <math>\\vec f</math> are sufficiently smooth functions, we can use the [[divergence theorem]] and change the order of the integration and <math>\\partial / \\partial t</math> to get a conservation law for the quantity <math>u</math> in the general form\n\n:<math>\\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{\\Omega} u d\\Omega  + \\int_{\\partial\\Omega} \\vec f(u) \\cdot \\vec n d\\Gamma = 0,</math>\nwhich means that the time rate of change of <math>u</math> in the domain <math>\\Omega</math> is equal to the net flux of <math>u</math> through its boundary <math>\\partial\\Omega</math>. Since this is an equality, it can be concluded that <math>u</math> is conserved within <math>\\Omega</math>.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Elliptic partial differential equation]]\n* [[Hypoelliptic operator]]\n* [[Parabolic partial differential equation]]\n* [[Relativistic heat conduction]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{Citation | last1=Evans | first1=Lawrence C. | title=Partial differential equations | origyear=1998 | url=http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2000-37-03/S0273-0979-00-00868-5/S0273-0979-00-00868-5.pdf | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | location=Providence, R.I. | edition=2nd | series=[[Graduate Studies in Mathematics]] | isbn=978-0-8218-4974-3 |mr=2597943 | year=2010 | volume=19}}\n* A.
