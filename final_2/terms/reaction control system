Use of diverted engine thrust to provide stable attitude control of a [[V/STOL|short-or-vertical takeoff and landing aircraft]], below conventional winged flight speeds, such as the [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier#Controls and handling|Harrier \"jump jet\"]], may also be referred to as a reaction control system.\n\nAn RCS is capable of providing small amounts of [[thrust]] in any desired direction or combination of directions. An RCS is also capable of providing [[torque]] to allow control of [[rotation]] ([[aircraft principal axes|roll, pitch, and yaw]]).\n\nRCS systems often use combinations of large and small ([[vernier thruster|vernier]]) thrusters, to allow different levels of response. Spacecraft reaction control systems are used:\n\n* for [[attitude control]] during [[re-entry]];\n* for [[stationkeeping]] in [[orbit]];\n* for close [[Space rendezvous|maneuvering]] during [[Space rendezvous|docking]] procedures;\n* for control of [[Orientation (geometry)|orientation]], or 'pointing the nose' of the craft;\n* as a backup means of [[atmospheric reentry|deorbiting]];\n* as [[ullage motor]]s to prime the fuel system for a main engine burn.\n\nBecause spacecraft only contain a finite amount of [[fuel]] and there is little chance to refill them, some alternative reaction control systems have been developed so that fuel can be conserved. For stationkeeping, some spacecraft (particularly those in [[geosynchronous orbit]]) use high-[[specific impulse|specific-impulse]] engines such as [[arcjet]]s, [[ion thruster]]s, or [[Hall effect thruster]]s. To control orientation, a few spacecraft, including the [[International Space Station|ISS]], use [[momentum wheel]]s which spin to control rotational rates on the vehicle.\n\n==Location of thrusters on spacecraft==\n[[File:Rcs-gemini.jpg|thumb|left|Gemini OAMS and Re-entry Control System]]\nThe [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] [[space capsule]] and [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] re-entry module both used groupings of nozzles to provide [[attitude control]]. The thrusters were located off their [[center of gravity]], thus providing a [[torque]] to rotate the capsule. The Gemini capsule was also capable of adjusting its re-entry course by rolling, which directed its off-center lifting force. The Mercury thrusters used a [[hydrogen peroxide]] monopropellant which turned to steam when forced through a [[tungsten]] screen, and the Gemini thrusters used [[hypergolic]] [[mono-methyl hydrazine]] fuel oxidized with [[nitrogen tetroxide]].\n\nThe Gemini spacecraft was also equipped with a hypergolic [[Orbit Attitude and Maneuvering System]], which made it the first manned spacecraft with [[translation (physics)|translation]] as well as rotation capability. In-orbit attitude control was achieved by firing pairs of eight {{convert|25|lbf|N|adj=on}} thrusters located around the circumference of its adapter module at the extreme aft end. Lateral translation control was provided by four {{convert|100|lbf|N|adj=on}} thrusters around the circumference at the forward end of the adaptor module (close to the spacecraft's center of mass). Two forward-pointing {{convert|85|lbf|N|adj=on}} thrusters at the same location, provided aft translation, and two {{convert|100|lbf|N|adj=on}} thrusters located in the aft end of the adapter module provided forward thrust, which could be used to change the craft's orbit.\n\nThe [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Command Module (CM)|Apollo Command Module]] had a set of twelve hypergolic thrusters for attitude control, and directional re-entry control similar to Gemini.\n\nThe Apollo [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Service Module (SM)|Service Module]] and [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] each had a set of sixteen [[R-4D]] hypergolic thrusters, grouped into external clusters of four, to provide both translation and attitude control. The clusters were located near the craft's centers of gravity, and were fired in pairs in opposite directions for attitude control.\n\nA pair of translation thrusters are located at the rear of the Soyuz spacecraft; the counter-acting thrusters are similarly paired in the middle of the spacecraft (near the center of mass) pointing outwards and forward. These act in pairs to prevent the spacecraft from rotating. The thrusters for the lateral directions are mounted close to the center of mass of the spacecraft, in pairs as well.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n==Location of thrusters on spaceplanes==\n[[File:Shuttle front RCS.jpg|thumb|250px|RCS thrusters on the nose of the [[Space Shuttle orbiter]]]]\n\nThe suborbital [[X-15]] and a companion training aero-spacecraft, the [[Lockheed NF-104A|NF-104 AST]], both intended to travel to an altitude that rendered their aerodynamic control surfaces unusable, established a convention for locations for thrusters on winged vehicles not intended to dock in space; that is, those that only have attitude control thrusters. Those for pitch and yaw are located in the nose, forward of the cockpit, and replace a standard radar system. Those for roll are located at the wingtips. The [[X-20]], which would have gone into orbit, continued this pattern.\n\nUnlike these, the [[Space Shuttle Orbiter]] had many more thrusters, as it was required to carry out docking maneuvers in orbit. Shuttle thrusters were grouped in the nose of the vehicle and on each of the two aft [[Orbital Maneuvering System]] pods. No nozzles interrupted the heat shield on the underside of the craft, instead, the nose RCS nozzles which control positive pitch were mounted on the side of the vehicle, and were canted downward. The downward-facing negative pitch thrusters were located in the [[Orbital Maneuvering System|OMS]] pods mounted in the tail/afterbody.\n\n==Space station systems==\nThe [[International Space Station]] uses electrically powered reaction control [[Control_moment_gyroscope|gyroscopes]] for primary attitude control, with RCS thruster systems as backup and augmentation systems.<ref>http://www.boeing.com/assets/pdf/defense-space/space/spacestation/systems/docs/ISS%20Motion%20Control%20System.pdf</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Attitude dynamics and control]]\n*[[Attitude control system]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/sts-rcs.html Space Shuttle RCS]\n* [http://www.jetaerospace.org/Thruster/ Jet Aerospace: Mono-fuel RCS thruster]\n\n[[Category:Spacecraft attitude control]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft design]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft propulsion]]"}]}}}}
