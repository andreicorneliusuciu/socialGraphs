The emf ''\u2130'' of the source is defined as the work ''dW'' done per charge ''dq'': ''\u2130'' = ''dW/dq''.\n</blockquote>\n\nAround 1830, [[Michael Faraday]] established that the reactions at each of the two electrode\u2013electrolyte interfaces provide the \"seat of emf\" for the voltaic cell, that is, these reactions drive the current and are not an endless source of energy as was initially thought.<ref name=cajori/> In the open-circuit case, charge separation continues until the electrical field from the separated charges is sufficient to arrest the reactions. Years earlier, [[Alessandro Volta]], who had measured a contact potential difference at the metal\u2013metal (electrode\u2013electrode) interface of his cells, had held the incorrect opinion that contact alone (without taking into account a chemical reaction) was the origin of the emf.\n\nIn the case of an electrical generator, a time-varying magnetic field inside the generator creates an electric field via [[electromagnetic induction]], \nwhich in turn creates a voltage difference between the generator terminals.  Charge separation takes place within the generator, with electrons flowing away from one terminal and toward the other, until, in the open-circuit case, sufficient electric field builds up to make further charge separation impossible.  Again the emf is countered by the electrical voltage due to charge separation.  If a load is attached, this voltage can drive a current. The general principle governing the emf in such electrical machines is [[Faraday's law of induction]].\n\n== Notation and units of measurement ==\nElectromotive force is often denoted by <math>\\mathcal{E}</math> or ''\u2130'' (script capital E, Unicode U+2130).\n\nIn a device without internal resistance, if an [[electric charge]] ''Q'' passes through that device, and gains an [[energy]] ''W'', the net emf for that device is the energy gained per unit [[electric charge|charge]], or ''W''/''Q''.

Thus,  the emf has the same value but opposite sign as the integral of the [[electric field]] aligned with an internal path between two terminals ''A'' and ''B'' of a source of emf in open-circuit condition (the path is taken from the negative terminal to the positive terminal to yield a positive emf, indicating work done on the electrons moving in the circuit).<ref name=Griffiths>\n{{cite book\n | title = Introduction to Electrodynamics\n | author = David J Griffiths\n | publisher = Pearson/Addison-Wesley\n | year = 1999\n | isbn = 0-13-805326-X\n | page = 293\n | edition=3rd\n }}</ref> \nMathematically:\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{E} = -\\int_{A}^{B} \\boldsymbol{E}_\\mathrm{cs} \\cdot \\mathrm{d} \\boldsymbol{ \\ell } \\ ,</math>\n\nwhere '''''E'''''<sub>cs</sub> is the conservative electrostatic field created by the charge separation associated with the emf, d'''\u2113''' is an element of the path from terminal ''A'' to terminal ''B'', and \u2018\u00b7\u2019 denotes the vector [[dot product]].<ref name =diode>\n\nOnly the electric field due to the charge separation caused by the emf is counted. In a solar cell, for example, an electric field is present related to the contact potential that results from thermodynamic equilibrium (discussed later), and this electric field component is not included in the integral.

At constant pressure the above relationship produces a [[Maxwell relation]] that links the change in open cell voltage with temperature ''T'' (a measurable quantity) to the change in entropy ''S'' when charge is passed [[isothermally]] and [[isobarically]]. The latter is closely related to the reaction [[entropy]] of the electrochemical reaction that lends the battery its power.

Volta's law about opposing electrode emfs implies that, given ten electrodes (for example, zinc and nine other materials), 45 unique combinations of voltaic cells (10 \u00d7 9/2) can be created.\n\n====Of cells====\nThe electromotive force produced by primary (single-use) and secondary (rechargeable) cells is usually of the order of a few volts.

A time-dependent magnetic field can be produced either by motion of a magnet relative to a circuit, by motion of a circuit relative to another circuit (at least one of these must be carrying a current), or by changing the current in a fixed circuit.  The effect on the circuit itself, of changing the current, is known as self-induction; the effect on another circuit is known as mutual induction.\n\nFor a given circuit, the electromagnetically induced emf is determined purely by the rate of change of the magnetic flux through the circuit according to [[Faraday's law of induction]].\n\nAn emf is induced in a coil or conductor whenever there is change in the [[flux linkage]]s. Depending on the way in which the changes are brought about, there are two types: When the conductor is moved in a stationary magnetic field to procure a change in the flux linkage, the emf is ''statically induced''.  The electromotive force generated by motion is often referred to as ''motional emf''.  When the change in flux linkage arises from a change in the magnetic field around the stationary conductor, the emf is ''dynamically induced.'' The electromotive force generated by a time-varying magnetic field  is often referred to as ''transformer emf''.\n\n===Contact potentials===\n{{See also|Volta potential|Electrochemical potential}}\nWhen solids of two different materials are in contact, [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] requires one of the solids assume a higher electrical potential than the other. This is called the ''contact potential''.<ref name=Trigg>\n\n{{cite book |title=Landmark experiments in twentieth century physics |author=George L.

The transfer causes a charge separation, with one body gaining electrons and the other losing electrons. This charge transfer causes a potential difference between the bodies, which partly cancels the potential originating from the contact, and eventually equilibrium is reached. At thermodynamic equilibrium, the [[Fermi level]]s are equal (the electron removal energy is identical) and there is now a built-in electrostatic potential between the bodies.\nThe original difference in Fermi levels, before contact, is referred to as the emf.<ref name=Sato>\n\n{{cite book |title=Electrochemistry at metal and semiconductor electrodes |author=Norio Sato |page=110 ''ff'' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=olQzaXNgM74C&pg=PA110 |isbn=0-444-82806-0 |year=1998 |publisher=Elsevier |edition=2nd |chapter= Semiconductor photoelectrodes}}\n\n</ref>\nThe contact potential cannot drive steady current through a load attached to its terminals because that current would involve a charge transfer. No mechanism exists to continue such transfer and, hence, maintain a current, once equilibrium is attained.\n\nOne might inquire why the contact potential does not appear in [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's law of voltages]] as one contribution to the sum of potential drops. The customary answer is that any circuit involves not only a particular diode or junction, but also all the contact potentials due to wiring and so forth around the entire circuit. The sum of ''all'' the contact potentials is zero, and so they may be ignored in Kirchhoff's law.<ref name=Quimby>\n\n{{cite book |title=Photonics and lasers |author=Richard S.

Light, of sufficient energy (greater than the [[bandgap]] of the material), creates mobile [[electron\u2013hole pair]]s in a semiconductor. Charge separation occurs because of a pre-existing electric field associated with the p-n junction in thermal equilibrium (a [[Volta potential|contact potential]] creates the field). This charge separation between positive [[Electron hole|hole]]s and negative [[electron]]s across a [[p-n junction]] (a [[diode]]) yields a ''forward voltage'', the ''photo voltage'', between the illuminated diode terminals.<ref name=Dhir>\n{{cite book\n | title=Electronic Components and Materials: Principles, Manufacture and Maintenance\n | author=S M Dhir\n | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sGbwj4J76tEC&pg=PA283\n | chapter=\u00a73.1 Solar cells |publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill\n | year=2000\n | isbn=0-07-463082-2\n }}</ref> As has been noted earlier in the [[#Terminology|terminology]] section, the photo ''voltage'' is sometimes referred to as the photo ''emf'', rather than distinguishing between the effect and the cause.

The light-induced charge separation eventually creates a current (called a forward current) I<sub>SH</sub> through the cell's junction in the  direction opposite that the light is driving the current. In addition, the induced voltage tends to [[p-n junction#Forward bias|forward bias]] the junction. At high enough levels, this forward bias of the junction will cause a forward current, I<sub>\nD</sub> in the diode opposite that induced by the light. Consequently, the greatest current is obtained under short-circuit conditions, and is denoted as ''I''<sub>L</sub> (for light-induced current) in the equivalent circuit.<ref name=Lorenzo>{{cite book\n |title=Solar Electricity: Engineering of photovoltaic systems\n |editor=Eduardo Lorenzo\n |author= Gerardo L.

This built-in potential is established when the junction is manufactured and that voltage a by-product of thermodynamic equilibrium within the cell. Once established, this potential difference cannot drive a current, however, as connecting a load does not upset this equilibrium.{{clarify|date=August 2015}}  In contrast, the accumulation of excess electrons in one region and of excess holes in another, due to illumination, results in a photo voltage that does drive a current when a load is attached to the illuminated diode. As noted above, this photo voltage also forward biases the junction, and so ''reduces'' the pre-existing field in the [[depletion region]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Counter-electromotive force]]\n*[[Electric battery]]\n*[[Electrochemical cell]]\n*[[Electrolytic cell]]\n*[[Galvanic cell]]\n*[[Voltaic pile]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Andrew Gray, \"Absolute Measurements in Electricity and Magnetism\", [https://books.google.com/books?vid=0pkd5YYtaGRtjR6Oes&id=WxeFSg38JLQC&pg=PA41&dq= Electromotive force].
