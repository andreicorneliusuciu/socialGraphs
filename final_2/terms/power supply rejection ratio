The output voltage will depend on the feedback circuit, as is the case of regular input offset voltages. But testing is not confined to [[Direct current|DC]] (zero frequency); often an operational amplifier will also have its PSRR given at various frequencies (in which case the ratio is one of [[RMS amplitude]]s of [[sinewave]]s present at a power supply compared with the output, with gain taken into account). Unwanted [[oscillation]], including [[Motorboating (electronics)|motorboating]], can occur when an amplifying stage is too sensitive to signals fed via the power supply from a later [[power amplifier]] stage.\n\nSome manufacturers specify PSRR in terms of the offset voltage it causes at the amplifiers inputs; others specify it in terms of the output; there is no industry standard for this issue.<ref>[http://www.analog.com/static/imported-files/tutorials/MT-043.pdf Op Amp Power Supply Rejection Ratio (PSRR) and Supply Voltages]. Analog Devices appnote/tutorial MT-043</ref> The following formula assumes it is specified in terms of output:\n<math> \n\\mathrm{PSRR} [\\mathrm{dB}] = 20 \\log_{10}\\left({\\Delta V_\\mathrm{supply} \\over {\\Delta  V_\\mathrm{out}}} \\cdot A_v\\right)\\mbox{dB}\n</math>\n\nFor example: an amplifier with a PSRR of 100&nbsp;dB in a circuit to give 40&nbsp;dB closed-loop [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] would allow about 1&nbsp;[[millivolt]] of power supply ripple to be superimposed on the output for every 1&nbsp;[[volt]] of ripple in the supply. This is because\n\n<math>100\\ \\mathrm{dB}-40\\ \\mathrm{dB} = 60\\ \\mathrm{dB} </math>.\n\nAnd since that's 60&nbsp;dB of rejection, the sign is negative so:\n\n<math> 1\\ \\mathrm{V} \\cdot 10^\\frac{-60}{20} = .001\\ \\mathrm{V} = 1\\ \\mathrm{mV} </math>\n\nNote:\n* The PSRR doesn't necessarily have the same poles as A(s), the open-loop gain of the op-amp, but generally tends to also worsen with increasing frequency (e.g. [http://focus.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/opa2277.pdf]).<ref>[https://www.wallindustries.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/appnotes.pdf Techniques for Output Ripple/Noise Measurement].</ref>\n* For amplifiers with both positive and negative power supplies (with respect to earth, as [[op-amp]]s often have), the PSRR for each supply voltage may be separately specified (sometimes written: PSRR+ and PSRR-), but normally the PSRR is tested with opposite polarity signals applied to both supply rails at the same time (otherwise the [[common-mode rejection ratio]] (CMRR) will affect the measurement of the PSRR).\n* For voltage regulators the PSRR is occasionally quoted (confusingly; to refer to ''output'' voltage change ratios), but often the concept is transferred to other terms relating changes in output voltage to input: Ripple rejection (RR) for low frequencies, line transient response for high frequencies, and line regulation for DC.\n* Sometimes k<sub>SVR</sub> (or simply SVR) is used to denote the power supply rejection ratio (e.g. [http://focus.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tl071.pdf])\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.analog.com/static/imported-files/tutorials/MT-043.pdf Operational Amplifier Power Supply Rejection Ratio (PSRR) and Supply Voltages by Analog Devices, Inc.
