GMT was formerly used as the international civil time standard, now superseded in that function by [[Coordinated Universal Time|Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)]]. Today GMT is considered equivalent to UTC for UK civil purposes (but this is not formalised) and for navigation is considered equivalent to [[Universal Time|UT1]] (the modern form of mean solar time at 0\u00b0 longitude); these two meanings can differ by up to 0.9 s. Consequently, the term GMT should not be used for precise purposes.<ref>Hilton and McCarthy 2013, p. 231&ndash;2)</ref>\n\nBecause of Earth's uneven speed in its elliptical [[orbit]] and its [[axial tilt]], noon (12:00:00) GMT is rarely the exact moment the [[sun]] crosses the [[Greenwich meridian]] and reaches its highest point in the sky there. This event may occur up to 16 minutes before or after noon GMT, a discrepancy calculated by the [[equation of time]]. Noon GMT is the annual average (i.e. \"mean\") moment of this event, which accounts for the word \"mean\" in \"Greenwich Mean Time\".\n\nOriginally, astronomers considered a GMT day to start at noon while for almost everyone else it started at midnight. To avoid confusion, the name [[Universal Time]] was introduced to denote GMT as counted from midnight.<ref name = McCarthySeidelmann2009/> Astronomers preferred the old convention to simplify their observational data, so that each night was logged under a single calendar date. Today Universal Time usually refers to UTC or UT1.<ref>''Astronomical Almanac Online'' 2015, Glossary s.v. \"[http://asa.usno.navy.mil/SecM/Glossary.html#ut Universal Time]\"</ref>\n\nThe term \"GMT\" is especially used by bodies connected with the United Kingdom, such as the [[BBC World Service]], the [[Royal Navy]], the [[Met Office]] and others particularly in Arab countries, such as the [[Middle East Broadcasting Centre]] and [[OSN]]. It is a term commonly used in the United Kingdom and countries of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], including Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan and Malaysia; and in many other countries of the eastern hemisphere. In some countries (Britain for example) Greenwich Mean Time is the legal time in the winter and the population uses the term. For an explanation of why this is see \"GMT in legislation\" below.\n\n== History ==\n\n{{Main|History of longitude}}\n\n[[Image:Greenwich clock.jpg|thumb | left | [[Shepherd Gate Clock|Greenwich clock]] with standard measurements]]\n\nAs the United Kingdom grew into an advanced [[maritime nation]], British mariners kept at least one [[marine chronometer|chronometer]] on GMT to calculate their [[longitude]] from the [[prime meridian|Greenwich meridian]], which was by convention considered to have longitude zero degrees, internationally adopted in the [[International Meridian Conference]] of 1884. Synchronisation of the chronometer on GMT did not affect shipboard time, which was still solar time. But this practice, combined with mariners from other nations drawing from [[Nevil Maskelyne]]'s method of [[Lunar distance (navigation)|lunar distance]]s based on observations at Greenwich, led to GMT being used worldwide as a standard time independent of location. Most [[time zone]]s were based upon GMT, as an offset of a number of hours (and possibly a half-hour) \"ahead of GMT\" or \"behind GMT\".\n\nGreenwich Mean Time was adopted across the island of [[Great Britain]] by the [[Railway Clearing House]] in 1847, and by almost all railway companies by the following year, from which the term \"[[railway time]]\" is derived. It was gradually adopted for other purposes, but a legal case in 1858 held \"[[local mean time]]\" to be the official time.<ref>Howse 1997, p. 114</ref> On 14 May 1880, a letter signed by 'Clerk to Justices' appeared in 'The Times', stating that 'Greenwich time is now kept almost throughout England, but it appears that Greenwich time is not legal time. For example, our polling booths were opened, say, at 8 13 and closed at 4 13 PM.'<ref>CLERK TO JUSTICES.

GMT was adopted on the [[Isle of Man]] in 1883, [[Jersey]] in 1898 and [[Guernsey]] in 1913. Ireland adopted GMT in 1916, supplanting [[Dublin Mean Time]].<ref name=\"Myers\">Myers (2007).</ref> Hourly [[time signal]]s from Greenwich Observatory were first broadcast on 5 February 1924, rendering the [[time ball]] at the observatory redundant in the process.\n\nThe daily rotation of the Earth is irregular (see [[\u0394T]]) and constantly slows; therefore the [[atomic clock]]s constitute a much more stable timebase. On 1 January 1972, GMT was superseded as the international civil time standard by Coordinated Universal Time, maintained by an ensemble of atomic clocks around the world. [[Universal Time|Universal Time (UT)]], a term introduced in 1928, initially represented mean time at Greenwich determined in the traditional way to accord with the originally defined [[International Meridian Conference|universal day]]; from 1 January 1956 (as decided by the [[IAU]] at Dublin, 1955, at the initiative of [[William Markowitz]]) this \"raw\" form of UT was re-labeled UT0 and effectively superseded by refined forms UT1 (UT0 equalised for the effects of polar wandering)<ref>[http://www.iers.org/MainDisp.csl?pid=101-181 UT1 as explained on IERS page]</ref> and UT2 (UT1 further equalised for annual seasonal variations in earth rotation rate).\n\n{{quote | Indeed, even the Greenwich meridian itself is not quite what it used to be\u2014defined by \"the centre of the transit instrument at the Observatory at Greenwich\". Although that instrument still survives in working order, it is no longer in use and now the meridian of origin of the world's longitude and time is not strictly defined in material form but from a statistical solution resulting from observations of all time-determination stations which the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures|BIPM]] takes into account when co-ordinating the world's time signals. Nevertheless, the line in the old observatory's courtyard today differs no more than a few metres from that imaginary line which is now the prime meridian of the world. | Howse, D. (1997). ''Greenwich time and the longitude''. London: Philip Wilson. | }}\n\n== Ambiguity in the definition of GMT ==\n\nHistorically GMT has been used with two different conventions for numbering hours. The long-standing astronomical convention dating from the work of [[Ptolemy]], was to refer to [[noon]] as zero hours (see [[Julian day]]). This contrasted with the civil convention of referring to [[midnight]] as zero hours dating from the Romans. The latter convention was adopted on and after 1 January 1925 for astronomical purposes, resulting in a discontinuity of 12 hours, or half a day earlier. The instant that was designated 'December 31.5 GMT' in 1924 almanacs became 'January 1.0 GMT' in 1925 almanacs. The term Greenwich Mean Astronomical Time (GMAT) was introduced to unambiguously refer to the previous noon-based astronomical convention for GMT.<ref>{{cite book\n | title = Astronomical Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac\n | publisher = University Science Books\n | year = 1992\n | isbn = 0-935702-68-7\n | page = 76\n}}</ref> The more specific terms UT and UTC do not share this ambiguity, always referring to midnight as zero hours.\n\n== GMT in legislation ==\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n\nLegally, the civil time used in Britain is called still \"Greenwich mean time\" (without capitalisation), according to the [[Interpretation Act 1978]], with an exception made for those periods when the Summer Time Act 1972 orders an hour's shift for daylight saving. The Interpretation Act 1978, section 9, provides that whenever an expression of time occurs in an Act, the time referred to shall (unless otherwise specifically stated) be held to be Greenwich mean time. Under subsection 23(3), the same rule applies to deeds and other instruments.<ref name=\"Myers\"/>\n\nDuring the experiment of 1968-1971, when the British Isles did not revert to Greenwich Mean Time during the winter, the all-year [[British Summer Time]] was called British Standard Time (BST).\n\nIn Britain, UTC+0 is disseminated to the general public in winter and UTC+1 in summer.<ref>Howse 1997, p. 157.</ref><ref name = McCarthySeidelmann2009>[[Dennis McCarthy (scientist)|McCarthy]] & Seidelmann 2009, p. 17.</ref>\n\nBBC radio stations broadcast the \"six pips\" of the [[Greenwich Time Signal]].

The 'GMT' time zone, were it drawn by purely [[geography|geographical terms]], would consist of the area between meridians 7\u00b030'W and 7\u00b030'E. As a result, there are European locales that despite lying in an area with a 'physical' UTC time use another time zone ([[UTC+1]] in particular); conversely, there are European areas that use UTC, even though their 'physical' time zone is [[UTC-1|UTC\u22121]] (e.g., most of [[Portugal]]), or UTC\u22122 (the westernmost part of [[Iceland]]). Because the UTC time zone in Europe is 'shifted' to the west, [[Lowestoft]] in the [[United Kingdom]] at only 1\u00b045'E is the easternmost settlement in Europe in which UTC is applied. Following is a list of the 'incongruencies':\n\n;Countries (or parts thereof) west of 22\u00b030'W (\"physical\" UTC\u22122) that use UTC\n* The westernmost part of Iceland, including the northwest peninsula and its main town of [[\u00cdsafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur]], which is west of 22\u00b030'W, uses UTC. [[Bjargtangar]], Iceland is the westernmost point in which UTC is applied.\n\n;Countries (or parts thereof) west of 7\u00b030'W (\"physical\" UTC\u22121) that use UTC\n* [[Canary Islands]] ([[Spain]])\n* Most of Portugal, including [[Lisbon]], [[Porto]], [[Braga]], [[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]], and [[Coimbra]]. (Only the easternmost part, including cities such as [[Bragan\u00e7a (Portugal)|Bragan\u00e7a]] and [[Guarda, Portugal|Guarda]], lies east of 7\u00b030'W.) Since the [[Treaty of Windsor (1386)|Treaty of Windsor]] in 1386 (the world's oldest diplomatic alliance), Portugal has maintained close ties to Britain, which possibly explains its choice of UTC. [[Madeira]], even further to the west, also employs UTC. A more likely explanation is that during the mid-1970s, when Portugal was on Central European Time all year round, it did not begin to get light in Lisbon in winter until 08:30.\n* Western part of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], including the cities of [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Limerick]], and [[Galway]].\n* Westernmost tip of [[Northern Ireland]], including the county town of [[County Fermanagh]], [[Enniskillen]]\n* Extreme westerly portion of the [[Outer Hebrides]], west of [[Scotland]]; for instance, [[Vatersay]], an inhabited island and the westernmost settlement in [[Great Britain]], lies at 7\u00b054'W. If [[uninhabited island]]s or rocks are taken into account [[St Kilda, Scotland|St Kilda]], west of the Outer Hebrides, at 8\u00b058'W, and [[Rockall]], at 13\u00b041'W, should be included.\n* Westernmost island of the [[Faroe Islands]] (autonomous region of the [[Denmark|Danish Kingdom]]), [[Mykines, Faroe Islands|Mykines]]\n* [[Iceland]], including [[Reykjav\u00edk]]\n* Northeastern part of [[Greenland]], including [[Danmarkshavn]]\n\n[[Image:Greenwich mean time line.jpg|thumb| This arch that stretches over a [[Highways in Spain|highway]] indicates the [[prime meridian]] in [[Spain]].]]\n\n;Countries (mostly) between meridians 7\u00b030'W and 7\u00b030'E (\"physical\" UTC) that use UTC+1\n* Spain (except for the Canary Islands, which use UTC).
