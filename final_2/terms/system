In 1824 he studied the system which he called the ''working substance'' (typically a body of water vapor) in steam engines, in regards to the system's ability to do work when heat is applied to it. The working substance could be put in contact with either a boiler, a cold reservoir (a stream of cold water), or a piston (to which the working body could do work by pushing on it). In 1850, the German physicist [[Rudolf Clausius]] generalized this picture to include the concept of the [[environment (systems)|surroundings]] and began to use the term \"working body\" when referring to the system.\n\nThe biologist [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]] (1901-1972) became one of the pioneers of the [[Systems theory|general systems theory]]. In 1945 he introduced ''models, principles, and laws that apply to generalized systems or their subclasses, irrespective of their particular kind, the nature of their component elements, and the relation or 'forces' between them.''<ref name=\"Bertalanfy1945\">1945, ''Zu einer allgemeinen Systemlehre,'' Bl\u00e4tter f\u00fcr deutsche Philosophie, 3/4.

Holland]] (1929- ), [[Murray Gell-Mann]] (1929- ) and others coined the term \"[[complex adaptive system]]\" at the interdisciplinary [[Santa Fe Institute]].\n\n==System concepts==\n;Environment and boundaries\n:[[Systems theory]] views the world as a complex system of interconnected parts. One scopes a system by defining its [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]]; this means choosing which entities are inside the system and which are outside\u2014part of the [[environment (systems)|environment]]. One can make simplified representations ([[Scientific modelling|models]]) of the system in order to understand it and to predict or impact its future behavior. These models may define the [[structure]] and [[behavior]] of the system.\n\n;Natural and human-made systems\n:There are natural and human-made (designed) systems. Natural systems may not have an apparent objective but their behavior can be interpreted{{by whom?|date=April 2016}} as purposefull by an observer. Human-made systems are made to satisfy an identified and stated need with purposes that are achieved by the delivery of wanted outputs. Their parts must be related; they must be \"designed to work as a coherent entity\" \u2013 otherwise they would be two or more distinct systems.\n\n[[File:OpenSystemRepresentation.svg|thumb|252px|''Open systems'' have input and output flows, representing exchanges of matter, energy or information with their surroundings.]]\n;Theoretical framework\n:An [[Open system (systems theory)|open system]] exchanges matter and energy with its surroundings. Most systems are open systems; like a car, a [[coffeemaker]], or a computer. A [[closed system]] exchanges energy, but not matter, with its environment; like Earth or the project [[Biosphere 2 | Biosphere2]] or 3. An [[isolated system]] exchanges neither matter nor energy with its environment. A theoretical example of such system is the [[Universe]].\n\n;Process and transformation process\n:An [[open system (systems theory)| open system]] can also be viewed as a bounded transformation process, that is, a [[black box]] that is a process or collection of processes that transforms inputs into outputs.{{cn|date=April 2016}} Inputs are consumed; outputs are produced. The concept of input and output here is very broad. For example, an output of a passenger ship is the movement of people from departure to destination.\n\n;Subsystem\n:A ''subsystem'' is a set of elements, which is a system itself, and a component of a larger system.\n\n;System model\n:A system comprises [[view model|multiple views]]. Man-made systems may have such views as [[concept]], [[systems analysis|analysis]], [[Systems design|design]], [[implementation]], deployment, structure, behavior, input data, and output data views. A [[system model]] is required to describe and represent all these multiple views.\n\n;Systems architecture\n:A [[system's architecture]], using one single integrated model for the description of [[view model|multiple views]] such as [[concept]], [[systems analysis|analysis]], [[Systems design|design]], [[implementation]], deployment, structure, behavior, structure-behavior coalescence, input data, and output data views, is a kind of [[system model]].\n\n==Analysis of systems==\nEvidently, there are many types of systems that can be analyzed both [[Quantitative research|quantitative]]ly and [[Qualitative research|qualitative]]ly. For example, with an analysis of urban systems dynamics, [A.W. Steiss]<ref>Steiss 1967, pp. 8\u201318.</ref> defines five intersecting systems, including the physical subsystem and behavioral system. For sociological models influenced by systems theory, where [[Kenneth D. Bailey (sociologist)|Kenneth D. Bailey]]<ref>Bailey, 1994.</ref> defines systems in terms of [[conceptual system|conceptual]], [[concrete]] and abstract systems; either [[Isolated system|isolated]], [[Closed system|closed]], or [[Open system (systems theory)|open]], [[Walter F. Buckley]]<ref>Buckley, 1967.</ref> defines social systems in sociology in terms of [[Mechanics|mechanical]], [[organic (model)|organic]], and [[process modeling|process]] models. [[Bela H. Banathy]]<ref>Banathy, 1997.</ref> cautions that with any inquiry into a system that understanding the type of system is crucial and defines Natural and Designed systems.\n\nSystems that are purposed by man inherently have a major flaw they must have a starting assumption(s) in which this starting assumption(s) is used to build further knowledge upon. This starting assumption(s) is not inherently bad, but it is used as the foundation of the system and as it is assumed to be true, and not definitively so then the system is not as structurally sound as perceived to be. For example, in Geometry (a subsystem of Math) this is highly evident when one goes through the process of taking theorems and extrapolates proofs from those set theorems.\n\nIn offering these more global definitions, the author maintains that it is important not to confuse one for the other. The theorist explains that natural systems include sub-atomic systems, [[living systems theory|living systems]], the [[solar system]], the [[galactic]] system and the Universe. Designed systems are our creations, our physical structures, hybrid systems which include natural and designed systems, and our conceptual knowledge. The human element of organization and activities are emphasized with their relevant abstract systems and representations. A key consideration in making distinctions among various types of systems is to determine how much freedom the system has to select purpose, goals, methods, tools, etc. and how widely is the freedom to select itself distributed (or concentrated) in the system.\n\n[[George J. Klir]]<ref>Klir 1969, pp. 69\u201372</ref> maintains that no \"classification is complete and perfect for all purposes,\" and defines systems in terms of abstract, [[The Real|real]], and [[conceptual system|conceptual]] [[physical systems]], bounded and [[unbounded system]]s, discrete to continuous, pulse to [[hybrid system]]s, etc. The interaction between systems and their environments are categorized in terms of relatively closed, and [[open system (systems theory)|open system]]s. It seems most unlikely that an absolutely closed system can exist or, if it did, that it could be known by us. Important distinctions have also been made between hard and soft systems.<ref>Checkland 1997; Flood 1999.</ref> Hard systems are technical in nature and amenable to methods such as [[systems engineering]], operations research and quantitative systems analysis. Soft systems involve people and organisations and are commonly associated with concepts developed by [[Peter Checkland]] and [[Brian Wilson (systems scientist)|Brian Wilson]] through ''Soft Systems Methodology'' (SSM) involving methods such as [[action research]] and emphasizing participatory designs. Where hard systems might be identified as more \"scientific,\" the distinction between them is actually often hard to define.\n\n===Cultural system===\nA cultural system may be defined as the interaction of different elements of [[culture]]. While a cultural system is quite different from a [[social system]], sometimes both systems together are referred to as the sociocultural system. A major concern in the social sciences is the problem of order.\n\n===Economic system===\n{{Main article|Economic system}}\nAn economic system is a mechanism ([[social institution]]) which deals with the [[Economic production|production]], [[distribution (business)|distribution]] and [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] of [[Good (economics)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] in a particular [[society]]. The economic system is composed of [[person|people]], [[institutions]] and their relationships to resources, such as the [[Convention (norm)|convention]] of [[property]]. It addresses the problems of [[economics]], like the allocation and scarcity of resources.\n\n==Application of the system concept==\nSystems modeling is generally a basic principle in engineering and in social sciences. The system is the representation of the entities under concern. Hence inclusion to or exclusion from system context is dependent of the intention of the modeler.\n\nNo model of a system will include all features of the real system of concern, and no model of a system must include all entities belonging to a real system of concern.\n\n===Systems in information and computer science===\nIn [[computer science]] and [[information science]], '''system''' is a [[software system]] which has [[Component (UML)|components]] as its structure and observable [[inter-process communication]]s as its behavior. Again, an example will illustrate: There are systems of counting, as with [[Roman numerals]], and various systems for filing papers, or catalogues, and various library systems, of which the [[Dewey Decimal Classification|Dewey Decimal System]] is an example. This still fits with the definition of components which are connected together (in this case in order to facilitate the flow of information).\n\nSystem can also be used referring to a framework, be it software or hardware, designed to allow software programs to run, see [[platform (computing)|platform]].\n\n===Systems in engineering and physics===\nIn [[engineering]] and [[physics]], a physical system is the portion of the universe that is being studied (of which a [[thermodynamic system]] is one major example). Engineering also has the concept of a system that refers to all of the parts and interactions between parts of a complex project. [[Systems engineering]] refers to the branch of engineering that studies how this type of system should be planned, designed, implemented, built, and maintained.\n\n===Systems in social and cognitive sciences and management research===\nSocial and cognitive sciences recognize systems in human person models and in human societies. They include human brain functions and human mental processes as well as normative ethics systems and social/cultural behavioral patterns.\n\nIn [[management science]], [[operations research]] and [[organizational development]] (OD), human organizations are viewed as '''systems''' (conceptual systems) of interacting components such as subsystems or system aggregates, which are carriers of numerous complex [[business processes]] ([[organizational behavior]]s) and organizational structures. Organizational development theorist [[Peter Senge]] developed the notion of organizations as systems in his book ''The Fifth Discipline''.\n\n[[Systems thinking]] is a style of thinking/[[reasoning]] and problem solving. It starts from the recognition of system properties in a given problem. It can be a leadership competency. Some people can ''think globally while acting locally''. Such people consider the potential consequences of their decisions on other parts of larger systems. This is also a basis of systemic coaching in psychology.\n\n[[Organizational studies|Organizational theorists]] such as [[Margaret Wheatley]] have also described the workings of organizational systems in new metaphoric contexts, such as [[quantum physics]], [[chaos theory]], and the [[self-organizing systems|self-organization of systems]].\n\n===Pure logical systems===\n\nThere is also such a thing as a logical system. The most obvious example is the calculus developed simultaneously by [[Leibniz]] and [[Isaac Newton]]. Another example is [[George Boole]]'s Boolean operators. Other examples have related specifically to philosophy, biology, or cognitive science. [[Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]] applies psychology to biology by using pure logic. Numerous psychologists, including [[Carl Jung]] and [[Sigmund Freud]] have developed systems which logically organize psychological domains, such as personalities, motivations, or intellect and desire. Often these domains consist of general categories following a [[Corollary]] such as a [[Theorem]]. Logic has been applied to categories such as [[Taxonomy (general)|Taxonomy]], [[Ontology]], [[Assessment]]{{disambiguation needed|date=April 2014}}, and [[Hierarchies]].\n\n===Systems applied to strategic thinking===\nIn 1988, military strategist, [[John A. Warden III]] introduced the [[Warden's Five Rings|Five Ring System]] model in his book, ''The Air Campaign'', contending that any complex system could be broken down into five concentric rings. Each ring\u2014Leadership, Processes, Infrastructure, Population and Action Units\u2014could be used to isolate key elements of any system that needed change. The model was used effectively by Air Force planners in the [[First Gulf War]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Warden |first=John A.
