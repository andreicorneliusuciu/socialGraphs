This includes treatment of an individual or group, based on their actual or perceived membership in a certain group or social category, \"in a way that is worse than the way people are usually treated\".<ref>{{cite web|title=discrimination, definition|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/american-english/discrimination |work=Cambridge Dictionaries Online|publisher=Cambridge University|accessdate=29 March 2013}}</ref> It involves the group's initial reaction or interaction going on to influence the individual's actual behavior towards the group leader or the group, restricting members of one group from opportunities or privileges that are available to another group, leading to the exclusion of the individual or entities based on logical or irrational decision making.<ref>Introduction to sociology. 7th ed. New York: [[W. W. Norton & Company]] Inc, 2009. p. 334.</ref>\n\nDiscriminatory traditions, policies, ideas, practices, and laws exist in many countries and [[institution]]s in every part of the world, even in ones where discrimination is generally looked down upon. In some places, controversial attempts such as quotas have been used to benefit those believed to be current or past victims of discrimination\u2014but have sometimes been called [[reverse discrimination]]. In the US, a government policy known as [[affirmative action]] was instituted to encourage employers and universities to seek out and accept groups such as [[African Americans]] and women, who have been subject to discrimination for a long time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bibliography on Race, Gender and Affirmative Action|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~eandersn/biblio.htm |work=Race, Gender, and Affirmative Action|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=28 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term ''discriminate'' appeared in the early 17th century in the English language. It is from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''discriminat-'' 'distinguished between', from the verb ''discriminare'', from ''discrimen'' 'distinction', from the verb ''discernere''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Definition of discrimination; Origin|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/discriminate?q=discriminate|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University|accessdate=14 January 2013}}</ref>  Since the [[American Civil War]] the term \"discrimination\" generally evolved in [[American English]] usage as an understanding of prejudicial treatment of an individual based solely on their race, later generalized as membership in a certain socially undesirable [[Social group|group]] or social category.<ref>Introduction to sociology. 7th ed. New York: [[W. W. Norton & Company]] Inc, 2009. page 324. Print.</ref>  \"Discrimination\" derives from Latin, where the verb ''discrimire'' means \"to separate, to distinguish, to make a distinction\".\n\n==Definitions==\nMoral philosophers have defined discrimination as ''disadvantageous'' treatment or consideration. This is a comparative definition. An individual need not be actually harmed in order to be discriminated against. They just need to be treated ''worse'' than others for some arbitrary reason. If someone decides to donate to help orphan children, but decides to donate less, say, to black children out of a racist attitude, then they would be acting in a discriminatory way even though the people they discriminate against are actually benefited by having some money donated to them.<ref>Kasper Lippert-Rasmussen, \"Private Discrimination: A Prioritarian, Desert-Accommodating Account\", ''San Diego Law Review'', 43, 817\u2013856 (2006); Oscar Horta, \"Discrimination in Terms of Moral Exclusion\", ''Theoria: Swedish Journal of Philosophy'', 76, 346-364 (2010).</ref>\n\nBased on realistic-conflict theory<ref>Sherif, M.

'''Sex discrimination''', on the other hand, may have legal consequences. Though what constitutes sex discrimination varies between countries, the essence is that it is an adverse action taken by one person against another person that would not have occurred had the person been of another sex. Discrimination of that nature is considered a form of [[prejudice]] and in certain enumerated circumstances is illegal in many countries.\n\nSexual discrimination can arise in different contexts. For instance, an employee may be discriminated against by being asked discriminatory questions during a job interview, or by an [[employer]] not hiring or promoting, unequally paying, or wrongfully terminating, an employee based on their gender. [[Image:OECD gender wage gap.svg|thumb|350px|The gender gap in median earnings of full-time employees according to the [[OECD]] 2015.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[OECD]]|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/54/57/40846335.pdf|title=OECD Employment Outlook 2008 \u2013 Statistical Annex OECD, Paris|year=2008|page=358|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206221033/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/54/57/40846335.pdf|archivedate= December 6, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref>]] Sexual discrimination can also arise when the dominant group holds a bias against the minority group.

Another setting where there have been claims of gender discrimination is banking; for example if one is refused credit or is offered unequal loan terms based on one\u2019s gender.<ref>{{cite book|author=Wilson, F.|year=2003|title=Organizational Behaviour and Gender|edition=2nd|location=Aldershot|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=9780754609001}}</ref>  As with other forms of unlawful discrimination, there are two types of sex discrimination \u2013 direct discrimination and indirect discrimination.

While a glass ceiling implies that women are less like to reach the top of the job ladder, a sticky floor is defined as the pattern that women are, compared to men, less likely to start to climb the job ladder. A sticky floor is related to gender differences at the bottom of the wage distribution.

Nevertheless, the problem of gender discrimination does not stop at transgender individuals or with women. Men are often the victim in certain areas of employment as men begin to seek work in office and childcare settings traditionally perceived as \"women's jobs\". One such situation seems to be evident in a recent case concerning alleged YMCA discrimination and a Federal Court Case in Texas.<ref>''Noack v YMCA of Greater Houston Area'',132,S. Ct.425 (US, 2011)</ref> The case actually involves alleged discrimination against both men and black people in childcare, even when they pass the same strict background tests and other standards of employment. It is currently being contended in federal court, as of fall 2009.\n\nDiscrimination in slasher films is relevant.  Gloria Cowan had a research group study on 57 different slasher films. Their results showed that the non-surviving females were more frequently sexual than the surviving females and the non-surviving males. Surviving as a female slasher victim was strongly associated with the absence of sexual behavior. In slasher films, the message appears to be that sexual women get killed and only the pure women survive, thus reinforcing the idea that female sexuality can be costly.<ref name=Cowan>{{cite journal|last=Cowan|first=Glora|author2=O'Brien, Margaret|title=Gender and Survival vs. Death in Slasher Films: A Content Analysis|journal=Sex Roles|year=1990|volume=23|pages=187\u2013196|doi=10.1007/BF00289865|issue=3\u20134}}</ref>\n\n===Sexual orientation===\n[[File:20051129 northlake-il5.jpg|thumb|right|[[Homophobia]]]]\n[[File:Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill protest.jpg|thumb|right|Protests in New York City against [[Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill|Uganda's Anti-Homosexuality Bill]].]]\n{{See also|Heterosexism|Heteronormativity|Biphobia|Homophobia}}\nOne\u2019s sexual orientation is a \"predilection for homosexuality, heterosexuality, or bisexuality\".<ref>''World English Dictionary'', [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sexual+orientation \"Sexual Orientation\"]</ref> Like most minority groups, homosexuals and bisexuals are not immune to prejudice and discrimination from the majority group.

It is a system of discrimination whereby the characteristics of a group are used to distinguish them as separate from the norm.<ref>Mountz, Alison. (2009) Key Concepts in Political Geography. SAGE. pp.328</ref> Othering plays a fundamental role in the history and continuance of racism and other forms of discrimination. For example, by objectifying culture as something different, exotic or underdeveloped is to generalise that it is not the same as \u2018normal\u2019 society. Europe\u2019s colonial attitude towards the Orient exemplifies through the attitude that the East was the opposite of the West; feminine where the West was masculine, weak where the West was strong and traditional where the West was progressive.<ref name=\"autogenerated357\">Said, Edward. (1978) Orientalism. New York: Pantheon Books. pp.357</ref> By making these generalisations and othering the East, Europe was simultaneously defining herself as the norm, further entrenching the perceived gap.<ref>Gregory, Derek. (2004) The Colonial Present. Blackwell Publishers. pp. 4</ref> Much of the process of othering relies on imagined difference, or the expectation of difference. Spatial difference can be enough to conclude that 'we' are 'here\u2019 and the 'others' are over 'there', making 'here' normal and 'there' foreign.<ref name=\"autogenerated357\"/> Imagined differences serve to categorise people into groups and assign them characteristics that suit the imaginer\u2019s expectations and desires.<ref>Said, Edward.

At the start of each session, each participant was assigned a color at random, either red or blue.  At each round, each player learned the color assigned to his or her opponent, but nothing else about the opponent.  Hargreaves-Heap and Varoufakis found that the players' behavior within a session frequently developed a discriminatory convention, giving a [[Nash equilibrium]] where players of one color (the \"advantaged\" color) [[pure strategy|consistently]] played the aggressive \"hawk\" strategy against players of the other, \"disadvantaged\" color, who played the acquiescent \"dove\" strategy against the advantaged color.  Players of both colors used a [[mixed strategy]] when playing against players assigned the same color as their own.\n\nThe experimenters then added a [[prisoners' dilemma|cooperation]] option to the game, and found that disadvantaged players usually cooperated with each other, while advantaged players usually did not.  They state that while the equilibria reached in the original HD game are predicted by [[evolutionary game theory]], game theory does not explain the emergence of cooperation in the disadvantaged group.  Citing earlier psychological work of [[Matthew Rabin]], they hypothesize that a norm of differing entitlements emerges across the two groups, and that this norm could define a \"fairness\" equilibrium within the disadvantaged group.<ref>{{citation|journal=[[The Economic Journal]]\n|author1=Shaun Hargreaves-Heap\n|author2=Yanis Varoufakis\n|url=http://varoufakis.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/ej-full-paper.pdf\n|title=Some experimental evidence on the evolution of discrimination, co-operation and perceptions of fairness\n|date=July 2002|volume=112\n|pages=679\u2013703|publisher=[[Royal Economic Society]]|doi=10.1111/1468-0297.00735}}</ref>\n\n==State vs. free market==\n{{Tone|date=December 2011}}\n\n===State discrimination===\n[[File:Lotshampa refugees in Beldangi Camp.jpg|thumb|In the 1990s, [[Bhutan]] [[Bhutanese refugees|expelled or forced to leave]] its Hindu population in the name of preserving its Buddhist culture and identity.]]\nIn politics, the dominating part of the population rules.

In the U.S., for example, around 1900 African-Americans started to compete for jobs that had previously been all-white. Officials, voted in by white majorities, changed the hiring rules for the federal civil service. Photographs of applicants were made obligatory in civil service job applications, and hiring officials were given discretion to choose between the three top scoring applicants. The number of blacks in federal employment was kept artificially low for decades.<ref name=enc>[http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Discrimination.html Discrimination], The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics, Library of Economics</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century, South Africa mine owners preferred hiring black workers because they were cheaper. Then the whites successfully persuaded the government to enact laws that highly restricted the black's rights to work (see [[Apartheid]]).<ref name=enc/>\n\nSimilarly, to make more profits, producers secretly hired screenwriters who were on Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]]'s blacklist, which mitigated the effects of the list.<ref name=enc/>\n\nWhen the \"Jim Crow\" racial segregation laws were enacted in the U.S., many companies disobeyed them for years, because the market automatically punishes companies that discriminate: they lose customers and get additional expenses. It took 15 years for the government to break down the resistance of the companies.<ref name=roback>Jennifer Roback, \"The Political Economy of Segregation: The Case of Segregated Streetcars.\" Journal of Economic History 56, no. 4 (December 1986): 893\u2013917.</ref>\n\n===Markets punish the discriminator===\nIn ''The Economics of Discrimination'' (University of Chicago Press, 1957), economist [[Gary Becker]] asserts that markets automatically punish the companies that discriminate.<ref name=murphy/>  According to Becker, the profitability of the company that discriminates is decreased, and the loss is \"directly proportional to how much the employer's decision was based on prejudice, rather than on merit\". Indeed, choosing a worker with lower performance (in comparison to salary) causes losses proportional to the difference in performance. Similarly, the customers who discriminate against certain kinds of workers in favor of less effective ones have to pay more for their services, on average.<ref name=murphy/>\n\nIf a company discriminates, it typically loses profitability and market share to the companies that do not discriminate, unless the state limits free competition protecting the discriminators.<ref name=enc/>\n\nIn  ''The Welfare Implications of Becker's Discrimination Coefficient'',   Richard S. Toikka disagrees, citing the ambivalent relations between discrimination and economic efficiency, as shown by the literature. According to Toikka the \"discriminatory tastes\", in Becker's explanation, was shown to be problematic because it implies discrimination is efficient.<ref>Richard S. Toikka, The Welfare Implications of Becker\u2019s Discrimination Coefficient, 13 J. ECON. THEORY 472, 472 (1976);  Glen G. Cain, The Economic Analysis of Labor Market Discrimination: A Survey, in 1 HANDBOOK OF LABOR ECONOMICS 693, 774 (Orley Ashenfelter & Richard Layard eds., 1986).</ref> Further, the very aim of the markets is to cater efficiently for the different \"tastes\" of all individuals, including customers, employees, employers, and firm owners (and discrimination happens within and between all these groups). If discrimination were just another \"taste\", then the markets were not to punish for it. Second, microeconomic theory turns to unusual method \u2013 explicit treatment of production functions \u2013 when it analyzes discrimination. And third, the very existence of discrimination in employment (defined as wages which differ from marginal product of the discriminated employees) at the long run, contradicts perfect competition and efficiency (which imply equality of wages and the said marginal product). Hence, the very existence of discrimination at the long run, contradicts the claim that the markets function well and punish the discriminators.<ref>For review of the literature in regard to the last two points see [http://www.glima.info/pdf/Employment-Discrimination-Paper-final.pdf Menahem Pasternak, Employment Discrimination: Some Economic Definitions, Critique and Legal Implications, 33 N.
