(2001) Delta Parallel Robot \u2014 the Story of Success, Online article available at http://www.parallemic.org/Reviews/Review002.html</ref> It consists of three arms connected to [[universal joints]] at the base. The key design feature is the use of [[parallelogram]]s in the arms, which maintains the orientation of the [[Industrial robot end effector|end effector]].  By contrast, a [[Stewart platform]] can change the orientation of its end effector.<ref>Bonev, I. The True Origins of Parallel Robots. Online article available at http://www.parallemic.org/Reviews/Review007.html</ref>\n\nDelta robots have popular usage in picking and packaging in factories because they can be quite fast, some executing up to 300 picks per minute.<ref>http://www.botjunkie.com/2009/11/03/adept-quattro-is-fastest-ever-for-the-moment/</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:TOSY Parallel Robot.JPG|thumb|Commercial [[pick and place]] robots]]\nThe delta robot (a parallel arm robot) was invented in the early 1980s by a research team led by professor [[Reymond Clavel]] at the [[\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne]] (EPFL, Switzerland).<ref>{{cite patent|US|4976582}}</ref> The purpose of this new type of robot was to manipulate light and small objects at a very high speed, an industrial need at that time.\nIn 1987, the Swiss company Demaurex purchased a license for the delta robot and started the production of delta robots for the [[packaging|packaging industry]]. In 1991 Reymond Clavel presented his doctoral thesis 'Conception d'un robot parall\u00e8le rapide \u00e0 4 degr\u00e9s de libert\u00e9',<ref name=\"Clavel, PhD\" >Clavel, R. (1991) [http://library.epfl.ch/theses/?nr=925 Conception d'un robot parall\u00e8le rapide \u00e0 4 degr\u00e9s de libert\u00e9]. Ph.D. Thesis, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland</ref> and received the golden robot award in 1999 for his work and development of the delta robot. Also in 1999, [[ABB Asea Brown Boveri|ABB Flexible Automation]] started selling its delta robot, the FlexPicker. By the end of 1999 delta robots were also sold by Sigpack Systems.\n\nIn 2009, [[FANUC]] released the newest version of the Delta robot, the FANUC M-1iA Robot,<ref>http://www.fanucrobotics.com/robotics-news/fanuc-press-releases/2009-Press-Releases/FANUC%20Robotics%20Introduces%20M-1iA%20Assembly%20Robot.pdf</ref> and would later release variations of this Delta robot for heavier payloads. FANUC released the M-3iA in 2010 for heavier payloads,<ref>http://www.fanucrobotics.com/robotics-news/fanuc-press-releases/2010-Press-Releases/01-11-10%20FANUC%20Robotics%20Introduces%20M-3iA%20Assembly%20Robot%20(6).pdf</ref> and most recently the FANUC M-2iA Robot for medium-sized payloads in 2012.<ref>http://www.fanucrobotics.com/robotics-news/fanuc-press-releases/2012-Press-Releases/9-12%20Stamped%20Part%20Stacking-New%20M-2iA.pdf</ref>\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:DeltaRamki.gif|thumb|Delta robot kinematics]]\nThe delta robot is a [[parallel robot]], i.e. it consists of multiple [[kinematic chain]]s connecting the base with the end-effector. The robot can also be seen as a spatial generalisation of a [[four-bar linkage]].<ref>Merlet, J.-P., Parallel Robots, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2000.</ref>\n\nThe key concept of the delta robot is the use of parallelograms which restrict the movement of the end platform to pure translation, i.e. only movement in the X, Y or Z direction with no rotation.\n\nThe robot's base is mounted above the workspace and all the [[actuator]]s are located on it. From the base, three middle jointed arms extend. The ends of these arms are connected to a small triangular platform. Actuation of the input links will move the triangular platform along the X, Y or Z direction. Actuation can be done with [[linear actuator|linear]] or rotational actuators, with or without reductions ([[Direct drive mechanism|direct drive]]).\n\nSince the actuators are all located in the base, the arms can be made of a light [[composite material]]. As a result of this, the moving parts of the delta robot have a small [[inertia]]. This allows for very high speed and high [[acceleration]]s. Having all the arms connected together to the end-effector increases the robot stiffness, but reduces its working volume.\n\nThe version developed by [[Reymond Clavel]] has four [[degrees of freedom (engineering)|degrees of freedom]]:<ref name=\"Clavel, PhD\" /> three translations and one rotation. In this case a fourth leg extends from the base to the middle of the triangular platform giving to the end effector a fourth, rotational degree of freedom around the vertical axis.\n\nCurrently other versions of the delta robot have been developed:\n* Delta with 6 degrees of freedom: developed by the company [[Fanuc]], on which a serial kinematic with 3 rotational degrees of freedom is placed on the end effector \n* Delta with 4 degrees of freedom: developed by the company [[Adept Technology|Adept]], which has 4 parallelogram directly connected to the end-platform instead of having a fourth leg coming in the middle of the end-effector\n* [[Pocketdelta robot|Pocket Delta]]: developed by the Swiss company [http://www.astral.ch/en/index.htm Astral SA], a 3-axis version of the Delta Robot adapted for flexible part feeding systems and other high-speed, high-precision applications.\n* Delta Direct Drive: a 3 degrees of freedom Delta Robot having the motor directly connected to the arms. Accelerations can be very high, from 30<ref>Miller, K., \"Modeling of Dynamics and Model-Based Control of DELTA Direct-Drive Parallel Robot,\" Journal of Robotics and Mechatronics, Vol. 17, No. 4, pp. 344-352, 1995.</ref> up to 100 [[G-force|g]].\n* Delta Cube: developed by the [[EPFL]] university laboratory LSRO, a delta robot built in a monolithic design, having flexure-hinges joints. This robot is adapted for ultra-high-precision applications.\n* Several \"linear delta\" arrangements have been developed where the motors drive linear actuators rather than rotating an arm. Such linear delta arrangements can have much larger working volumes than rotational delta arrangements.<ref>\n[http://issuu.com/epfl/docs/reymond_clavel_eng \"Gallery of robots - prof. Reymond Clavel\"]\n</ref><ref>\nReymond CLAVEL.\n[http://jnrr2011.irccyn.ec-nantes.fr/presentations/ReymondClavel.pdf \"Robots parall\u00e8les\"]\n</ref>\n\nThe majority of delta robots use rotary actuators. Vertical linear actuators have recently been used (using a linear delta design) to produce a novel design of [[3D printer]].<ref>{{Cite web\n  |title=Rostock (delta robot 3D printer)\n  |url=http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:17175\n  |publisher=[[Thingiverse]]\n  |author=Johann Rocholl \n  |date=6 Feb 2012 \n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web\n  |title=3D printing with a delta robot that seems to simplify the concept\n  |url=http://hackaday.com/2012/07/13/3d-printing-with-a-delta-robot-that-seems-to-simplify-the-concept/\n  |date=13 July 2012\n  |author=Mike Szczys\n}}</ref> These offer advantages over conventional leadscrew-based 3D printers of quicker access to a larger build volume for a comparable investment in hardware.\n\n== Applications ==\n[[File:Large delta-style 3D printer.jpg|thumb|Large delta-style 3D printer<ref>{{cite news|title=Hoosier Daddy \u2013 The Largest Delta 3D Printer In the World|url=http://www.3dprinterworld.com/article/hoosier-daddy-largest-delta-3d-printer-world|accessdate=28 September 2014|work=3D Printer World|publisher=Punchbowl Media|date=23 July 2014}}</ref>]]\n\n{{refimprove section|date=July 2012}}\nIndustries that take advantage of the high speed of delta robots are the packaging industry, medical and pharmaceutical industry. For its stiffness it is also used for surgery. Other applications include high precision assembly operations in a [[clean room]] for electronic components.\nThe structure of a delta robot can also be used to create [[Haptic technology#Games|haptic]] controllers.<ref>{{cite web\n  |title=Feeling virtual worlds\n  |url=http://sunnybains.typepad.com/blog/2007/08/feeling-virtual.html\n  |author= Sunny Bains\n  |date=8 August 2007\n}}</ref> More recently, the technology has been adapted to [[3D printers]]. These printers can be built for about a thousand dollars and compete well with the traditional Cartesian printers from the [[RepRap]] project.\n\n== References ==\n{{Commons category|Delta robots}}\n{{Reflist|colwidth=35em}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2011}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Delta Robot}}\n[[Category:Robot kinematics]]\n[[Category:Industrial robots]]\n[[Category:Delta robots| ]]\n[[Category:Parallel robots]]"}]}}}}
