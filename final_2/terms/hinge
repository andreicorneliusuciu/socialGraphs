Two objects connected by an ideal hinge rotate relative to each other about a fixed [[axis of rotation]]. Hinges may be made of [[Flexure bearing|flexible material]] or of moving components. In [[biology]], many [[joint]]s function as hinges like the elbow joint.\n\n==Door types==\nThere are many types of [[door]] hinges. The main types include:\n\n;Barrel hinge: which is a sectional barrel secured by a [[wiktionary:pivot|pivot]]. A ''barrel'' is a component of a hinge, that has a hollow [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] shaped section where the rotational bearing force is applied to the pivot, and may also have a [[screw]] shaped section for fastening and/or driving the pivot.\n;Pivot hinges: which pivot in openings in the floor and the top of the door frame. Also referred to as a double-acting floor hinge. This type is found in ancient dry stone buildings and rarely in old wooden buildings. These are also called haar-hung doors.\n;Butt/Mortise hinges: usually in threes or fours, which are inset (mortised) into the door and frame.  Most residential hinges found in the U.S. are made of steel, although mortise hinges for exterior doors are often made of brass or stainless steel to prevent corrosion.\n;Case hinges: Case hinges are similar to a butt hinge however usually more of a decorative nature most commonly used in suitcases, briefcases and the like.\n[[File:Continuoushinge.jpg|50px|right]]\n;Continuous hinges, or piano hinges: This type of hinge is also known as a piano hinge. It runs the entire length of the door, panel, or box. Continuous hinges are manufactured with or without holes. These hinges also come in various thicknesses, pin diameters, and knuckle lengths.\n[[File:Topfscharnier.jpg|50px|right]]\n;{{anchor|Concealed hinge}}Concealed hinges: Used for furniture doors (with or without self-closing feature, and with or without damping systems). They are made of two parts: One part is the hinge cup and the arm, the other part is the mounting plate. Also called \"cup hinge\", or \"Euro hinge\", as they were developed in Europe and use metric installation standards.  Most such concealed hinges offer the advantage of full ''in situ'' adjustability for standoff distance from the cabinet face as well as pitch and roll by means of two screws on each hinge.\n;Butterfly hinges, or Parliament (UK) Hinges: These were known as dovetail hinges from the 17th century onwards and can be found on old desks and cabinets from about 1670 until the 18th century. The form of these hinges varied slightly between manufacturers, and their size ranged from the very large for heavy doors to the tiniest decorative hinge for use on jewellery boxes. Many hinges of this type were exported to America to support the home trade's limited supply. They are still found to be both fairly cheap and decorative, especially on small items.\n;Flag hinges: A flag hinge can be taken apart with a fixed pin on one leaf. Flag hinges can also swivel a full 360 degrees around the pin. Flag hinges are manufactured as a right hand and a left hand configuration.\n[[File:Hinge 03.jpg|50px|right]]\n;Strap hinges: Strap hinges are an early hinge and used on many kinds of interior and exterior doors and cabinets.\n;H hinges: Shaped like an H and used on flush-mounted doors.  Small H hinges ({{convert|3|\u2013|4|in|mm|abbr=on|disp=or}}) tend to be used for cabinets hinges, while larger hinges ({{convert|6|\u2013|7|in|mm|abbr=on|disp=or}}) are for passage doors or closet doors.\n;HL hinges: Large HL hinges were common for passage doors, room doors and closet doors in the 17th, 18th and even 19th centuries. On taller doors H hinges were occasionally used in the middle along with the HL hinges.\n\nOther types include:\n*Counterflap hinge\n*Flush hinge\n*Coach hinge\n*Rising Butt hinge\n*Double action spring hinge\n*Tee hinge\n*Friction hinge\n*Security hinge\n*Cranked hinge or stormproof hinge\n*Lift-off hinge\n*Self closing hinge\n\n==Building access==\nSince at least [[medieval]] times there have been hinges to [[draw bridge]]s for defensive purposes for fortified buildings. Hinges are used in contemporary [[architecture]] where building settlement can be expected over the life of the building. For example, the [[Dakin Building]] in [[Brisbane, California|Brisbane]], [[California]], was designed with its entrance ramp on a large hinge to allow settlement of the building built on piles over [[bay mud]]. This device was effective until October 2006, when it was replaced due to damage and excessive ramp slope.\n\n==Large structures==\nHinges appear in large structures such as elevated freeway and railroad viaducts. These are included to reduce or eliminate the transfer of bending stresses between structural components, typically in an effort to reduce sensitivity to [[earthquakes]]. The primary reason for using a hinge, rather than a simpler device such as a slide, is to prevent the separation of adjacent components. When no bending stresses are transmitted across the hinge it is called a ''zero moment hinge''.\n\n== Spacecraft ==\n\nPeople have developed a variety of self-actuating, self-locking hinge designs for spacecraft [[deployable structure]]s such as [[solar array]] panels, synthetic aperture radar antennas, booms, radiators, etc.<ref>\nAlan M. Watt; and Sergio Pellegrino.\n[http://www-civ.eng.cam.ac.uk/dsl/publications/TSR_hinge.pdf \"Tape-Spring Rolling Hinges\"]\np. 2.\n</ref>\n\n==Hinge Terminology==\n[http://www.hingecraft.com/Terminology.html Hingecraft has graphic] visualizing many of these terms. More terms and explanations also on [http://www.guden.com/Control/glossary Guden's page].\n\n===Components===\n;Pin: The rod that holds the ''leaves'' together, inside the ''knuckle''.\n;Knuckle: The hollow\u2014typically circular\u2014portion creating the joint of the hinge through which the ''pin'' is set. The ''knuckles'' of either ''leaf'' typically alternate and interlock with the ''pin'' passing through all of them. (aka. '''loop''', '''joint''', '''node''' or '''curl''')\n;Leaf: The portions (typically two) that extend laterally from the ''knuckle'' and typically revolve around the ''pin''.\n\n===Characteristics===\n;End Play: Axial movement between the ''leaves'' along the axis of the ''pin''. This motion allows the leaves to rotate without binding and is determined by the typical distance between ''knuckles'' (knuckle gap) when both edges of the ''leaves'' are aligned.\n;Gauge: Thickness of the ''leaves''.\n;Hinge Width: Length from the outer edge of one ''leaf'' to the outer edge of the other ''leaf'', perpendicularly across the ''pin''. (aka. '''open width''')\n;Hinge Length: The length of the ''leaves'' parallel to the pin.\n;Knuckle Length: The typical length of an individual ''knuckle'' parallel to the pin.\n;Leaf Width: Length from the center of the ''pin'' to the outer edge of the ''leaf''.\n;Pitch: Distance from the end of a knuckle to the same edge of its adjacent knuckle on the same leaf\n;Slop: A colloquialism referring to loose angular movement of the leaves relative to the pin ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy9Di5FWp6c video demonsetration]).\n\n==Other types==\n;Hinge (film): A short film by Aldo Emiliano Velasco (Echo) about the origin of the hinge.\n;[[tray|Butler tray]] hinge: Fold to 90 degrees and also snap flat. They are for tables that have a tray top for serving.\n;Card table hinge: Mortised into edge of antique or reproduction card tables and allow the top to fold onto itself.\n;[[Drop-leaf table]] hinge: Mounted under the surface of a table with leaves that drop down. They are most commonly used with rule joints.\n;Piano hinge: a long hinge, originally used for [[piano]] lids, but now used in many other applications where a long hinge is needed.\n;[[Living hinge]]: a hinge consisting of material that flexes\n\n<gallery>\nImage:HingesOldA.jpg|Old construction of hinges in the dry stone wall near [[Bignasco]].\nImage:HingesOldB.jpgAncient pivot hinges, found in the [[Dry stone wall|dry stone]] buildings.\nImage:Hingebifold.JPG|A flushed door hinge.\nImage:Hinge2P2.jpg|A barrel hinge made of wrought iron.\nImage:Hinge2P3.jpg|A barrel hinge made of bronze strap.\nImage:Hinge3P.jpg|Increasing the number of loops to 3 allows the butt hinge axis to be fixed from both ends.\nImage:Topfscharnier.jpg|Door in furniture with spring to lock door both fully shut and fully open positions.
