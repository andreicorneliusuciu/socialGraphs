In principle, any [[alternating current|AC]] [[electrical generator]] can be called an alternator, but usually the term refers to small rotating machines driven by automotive and other internal combustion engines. An alternator that uses a [[magnet|permanent magnet]] for its [[magnetic field]] is called a [[magneto]]. Alternators in [[power station]]s driven by [[steam turbine]]s are called turbo-alternators.

This emf reverses its polarity when it moves under magnetic poles of opposite polarity. Typically, a rotating magnet, called the [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]] turns within a stationary set of conductors wound in coils on an iron core, called the [[stator]]. The field cuts across the conductors, generating an induced EMF (electromotive force), as the mechanical input causes the rotor to turn.\n\nThe [[rotating magnetic field]] induces an [[alternating current|AC voltage]] in the stator windings.  Since the currents in the stator windings vary in step with the position of the rotor, an alternator is a synchronous generator.<ref name=Slemon/>\n\nThe rotor's magnetic field may be produced by permanent magnets, or by a field coil electromagnet. Automotive alternators use a rotor winding which allows control of the alternator's generated voltage by varying the current in the rotor field winding.  Permanent magnet machines avoid the loss due to magnetizing current in the rotor, but are restricted in size, due to the cost of the magnet material.  Since the permanent magnet field is constant, the terminal voltage varies directly with the speed of the generator.  Brushless AC generators are usually larger than those used in automotive applications.\n\nAn automatic voltage control device controls the field current to keep output voltage constant. If the output voltage from the stationary armature coils drops due to an increase in demand, more current is fed into the rotating field coils through the [[voltage regulator]] (VR). This increases the magnetic field around the field coils which induces a greater voltage in the armature coils. Thus, the output voltage is brought back up to its original value.\n\nAlternators used in central [[power station]]s also control the field current to regulate [[reactive power]] and to help stabilize the power system against the effects of momentary [[fault (power engineering)|faults]]. Often there are three sets of stator windings, physically offset so that the rotating magnetic field produces a [[three phase]] current, displaced by one-third of a period with respect to each other.\n\n==Synchronous speeds==\n\nOne cycle of alternating current is produced each time a pair of field poles passes over a point on the stationary winding. The relation between speed and frequency is <math>N=120f/P</math>, where <math>f </math> is the frequency in Hz (cycles per second). <math>P</math> is the number of poles (2,4,6...) and <math> N </math> is the rotational speed in [[revolutions per minute]] (RPM). Very old descriptions of [[alternating current]] systems sometimes give the frequency in terms of alternations per minute, counting each half-cycle as one ''alternation''; so 12,000 alternations per minute corresponds to 100&nbsp;Hz.\n\nThe output [[frequency]] of an alternator depends on the number of poles and the rotational speed. The speed corresponding to a particular frequency is called the ''synchronous speed'' for that frequency. This table<ref>The Electrical Year Book 1937, published by Emmott & Co. Ltd., Manchester, England, page 72</ref> gives some examples:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Poles\n! RPM for 50&nbsp;Hz\n! RPM for 60&nbsp;Hz\n!

The alternators that use permanent magnets are specifically called [[Magneto (generator)|magnetos]]. \nIn other alternators, wound field coils form an [[electromagnet]] to produce the rotating magnetic field.\n\nAll devices that use permanent magnets and produce alternating current are called PMA or permanent magnet alternator.  A \"permanent magnet generator\" (PMG) may produce either alternating current, or direct current if it has a [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]]. If the permanent magnet device makes only AC current, it is correctly called a PMA.\n\n==== Direct connected DC generator ====\nThis method of excitation consists of a smaller [[Direct current|direct-current]] (DC) generator fixed on the same shaft with the alternator. The DC generator generates a small amount of electricity just enough to ''excite'' the field coils of the connected alternator to generate electricity. A variation of this system is a type of alternator which uses direct current from the battery for excitation, after which the alternator is self-excited.<ref name=\"faa\"/>\n\n==== Transformation and rectification ====\nThis method depends on residual magnetism retained in the iron core to generate weak magnetic field which would allow weak voltage to be generated. The voltage is used to excite the field coils for the alternator to generate stronger voltage as part of its ''build up'' process. After the initial AC voltage buildup, the field is supplied with [[rectifier|rectified voltage]] from the alternator.<ref name=\"faa\"/>\n\n==== Brushless alternators ====\nA brushless alternator is composed of two alternators built end-to-end on one shaft. Smaller brushless alternators may look like one unit but the two parts are readily identifiable on the large versions. The larger of the two sections is the main alternator and the smaller one is the exciter. The exciter has stationary field coils and a rotating armature (power coils). The main alternator uses the opposite configuration with a rotating field and stationary armature. A [[bridge rectifier]], called the rotating rectifier assembly, is mounted on the rotor. Neither brushes nor slip rings are used, which reduces the number of wearing parts. The main alternator has a rotating field as described above and a stationary armature (power generation windings).\n\nVarying the amount of current through the stationary exciter field coils varies the 3-phase output from the exciter. This output is rectified by a rotating rectifier assembly, mounted on the rotor, and the resultant DC supplies the rotating field of the main alternator and hence alternator output. The result of all this is that a small DC exciter current indirectly controls the output of the main alternator.\n\nEarly Honda four-cylinder motorcycles (CB750F, CB350F, CB500F, CB550F) used a brushless Hitachi 200W alternator. This had a fixed \"rotor\" winding on the outer cover; the outer end of the iron core was a disc that closed the outer rotor pole. The rotor comprised two intermeshed six- pole \"claws\" welded to and spaced apart by a non-magnetic ring. It bolted directly to the end of the five-bearing crank by the hub of one pole. The other pole had an open end to receive the stator winding. The outer cover also mounted the three-phase stator windings. The magnetic circuit had two auxiliary air gaps between the rotor and its stationary core. The regulator was a conventional automotive type with vibrating points. As it had no slip rings, it was very compact and rugged, but due to the auxiliary air gaps, it had poor efficiency.\n\n===  By number of phases ===\n{{Main|Single-phase generator|Polyphase coil}}\nAnother way to classify alternators is by the number of phases of their output voltage. The output can be single phase, or polyphase. Three-phase alternators are the most common, but polyphase alternators can be two phase, six phase, or more.<ref name=\"faa\"/>\n\n=== By rotating part ===\nThe revolving part of alternators can be the [[Armature (electrical engineering)|armature]] or the magnetic field. The revolving armature type has the armature wound on the rotor, where the winding moves through a stationary magnetic field. The revolving armature type is not often used.<ref name=\"faa\"/> The revolving field type has magnetic field on the rotor to rotate through a stationary armature winding. The advantage is that then the rotor circuit carries much less power than the armature circuit, making the [[slip ring]] connections smaller and less costly; only two contacts are needed for the direct-current rotor, whereas often a rotor winding has three phases and multiple sections which would each require a slip ring connection. The stationary armature can be wound for any convenient medium voltage level, up to tens of thousands of volts; manufacture of slip ring connections for more than a few thousand volts is costly and inconvenient.\n\n==Specific applications==\n\n===Electric generators===\n{{details|Electric generator}}\nMost power generation stations use synchronous machines as their generators. Connection of these generators to the utility grid requires synchronization conditions to be met.<ref>[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6175812 Soft synchronization of dispersed generators to micro grids for smart grid applications]</ref>\n\n===Automotive alternators===\n{{details|Alternator (automotive)}}\n[[File:Jeep 2.5 liter 4-cylinder engine chromed e.jpg|thumb|right|Alternator mounted on an automobile engine with a [[serpentine belt]] pulley]]\nAlternators are used in modern [[automobile]]s to charge the [[Automotive battery|battery]] and to power the electrical system when its [[internal combustion engine|engine]] is running.\n\nUntil the 1960s, automobiles used DC [[dynamo]] generators with [[commutator (electric)|commutator]]s. With the availability of affordable [[silicon diode]] rectifiers, alternators were used instead.\n\n=== Diesel electric locomotive alternators ===\nIn later [[diesel electric locomotive]]s and [[diesel electric multiple unit]]s, the [[prime mover (locomotive)|prime mover]] turns an alternator which provides electricity for the [[traction motor]]s (AC or DC).\n\nThe traction alternator usually incorporates integral silicon diode rectifiers to provide the traction motors with up to 1200 volts DC (DC traction, which is used directly) or the common inverter bus (AC traction, which is first inverted from dc to three-phase ac).\n\nThe first diesel electric locomotives, and many of those still in service, use DC generators as, before silicon power electronics, it was easier to control the speed of DC traction motors. Most of these had two generators: one to generate the excitation current for a larger main generator.\n\nOptionally, the generator also supplies [[head end power]] (HEP) or power for [[electric train heating]]. The HEP option requires a constant engine speed, typically 900 RPM for a 480 V 60&nbsp;Hz HEP application, even when the locomotive is not moving.\n\n=== Marine alternators ===\nMarine alternators used in yachts are similar to automotive alternators, with appropriate adaptations to the salt-water environment. Marine alternators are designed to be [[explosion proof]] so that brush sparking will not ignite explosive gas mixtures in an engine room environment. They may be 12 or 24 volt depending on the type of system installed. Larger marine diesels may have two or more alternators to cope with the heavy electrical demand of a modern yacht. On single alternator circuits, the power may be split between the engine starting battery and the domestic or house battery (or batteries) by use of a [[split-charge diode]] ([[battery isolator]]) or a voltage-sensitive relay.\n\n=== Radio alternators ===\nHigh frequency alternators of the variable-reluctance type were applied commercially to radio transmission in the low-frequency radio bands. These were used for transmission of [[Morse code]] and, experimentally, for transmission of voice and music. In the [[Alexanderson alternator]], both the field winding and armature winding are stationary, and current is induced in the armature by virtue of the changing magnetic reluctance of the rotor (which has no windings or current carrying parts). Such machines were made to produce radio frequency current for radio transmissions, although the efficiency was low.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Bottle dynamo]]\n* [[Dynamo]]\n* [[Electric generator]]\n*[[Engine-generator]]\n*[[Folsom Powerhouse State Historic Park]]\n* [[Hub dynamo]]\n*[[Induction generator]], using regular induction (asynchronous) motor\n*[[Jedlik's dynamo]]\n*[[Linear alternator]]\n* [[Magneto]]\n*[[Polyphase coil]]\n*[[Revolving armature alternator]]\n*[[Single-phase generator]]\n*[[Flux switching alternator]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Thompson, Sylvanus P., ''Dynamo-Electric Machinery, A Manual for Students of Electrotechnics'', Part 1, Collier and Sons, New York, 1902\n* White, Thomas H.,\"''[http://earlyradiohistory.us/sec008.htm Alternator-Transmitter Development] (1891\u20131920)''\".
