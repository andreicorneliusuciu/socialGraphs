The sound waves are generated by a sound source, such as the vibrating [[Diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] of a [[stereo]] speaker. The sound source creates vibrations in the surrounding medium. As the source continues to vibrate the medium, the vibrations propagate away from the source at the [[speed of sound]], thus forming the sound wave. At a fixed distance from the source, the pressure, [[velocity]], and displacement of the medium vary in time. At an instant in time, the pressure, velocity, and displacement vary in space. Note that the particles of the medium do not travel with the sound wave. This is intuitively obvious for a solid, and the same is true for liquids and gases (that is, the vibrations of particles in the gas or liquid transport the vibrations, while the ''average'' position of the particles over time does not change).  During propagation, waves can be [[Reflection (physics)|reflected]], [[Refraction|refracted]], or [[Attenuation|attenuated]] by the medium.<ref name=\"JHU\">{{cite web|url=http://pages.jh.edu/~virtlab/ray/acoustic.htm|title=The Propagation of sound|accessdate=26 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe behavior of sound propagation is generally affected by three things:\n* A complex relationship between the [[density]] and pressure of the medium. This relationship, affected by [[temperature]], determines the speed of sound within the medium.\n* Motion of the medium itself. If the medium is moving, this movement may increase or decrease the absolute speed of the sound wave depending on the direction of the movement. For example, sound moving through wind will have its speed of propagation increased by the speed of the wind if the sound and wind are moving in the same direction. If the sound and wind are moving in opposite directions, the speed of the sound wave will be decreased by the speed of the wind.\n* The viscosity of the medium. Medium [[viscosity]] determines the rate at which sound is attenuated. For many media, such as air or water, attenuation due to viscosity is negligible.\n\nWhen sound is moving through a medium that does not have constant physical properties, it may be [[refracted]] (either dispersed or focused).<ref name=\"JHU\" />\n\n[[File:Spherical pressure waves.gif|thumb|right|260px|Spherical compression (longitudinal) waves]]\n\nThe mechanical vibrations that can be interpreted as sound are able to travel through all [[State of matter|forms of matter]]: [[gas]]es, [[liquid]]s, [[solid]]s, and [[plasma (physics)|plasmas]]. The matter that supports the sound is called the [[Transmission medium|medium]]. Sound cannot travel through a [[vacuum]].\n\n===Longitudinal and transverse waves===\nSound is transmitted through gases, plasma, and liquids as [[longitudinal wave]]s, also called [[compression (physical)|compression]] waves. It requires a medium to propagate. Through solids, however, it can be transmitted as both longitudinal waves and [[transverse wave]]s. Longitudinal sound waves are waves of alternating [[pressure]] deviations from the [[Mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] pressure, causing local regions of [[compression (physical)|compression]] and [[rarefaction]], while [[transverse wave]]s (in solids) are waves of alternating [[shear stress]] at right angle to the direction of propagation.\n\nSound waves may be \"viewed\" using parabolic mirrors and objects that produce sound.<ref>{{cite web|title=What Does Sound Look Like?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px3oVGXr4mo|work=NPR|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=9 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe energy carried by an oscillating sound wave converts back and forth between the potential energy of the extra [[compression (physical)|compression]] (in case of longitudinal waves) or lateral displacement [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] (in case of transverse waves) of the matter, and the kinetic energy of the displacement velocity of particles of the medium.\n\n===Sound wave properties and characteristics===\n[[File:The Elements of Sound jpg.jpg|thumb|right|upright |260 px| A 'pressure over time' graph of a 20 ms recording of a clarinet tone demonstrates the two fundamental elements of sound: Pressure and Time.]]\n[[File:Sine waves different frequencies.svg|thumb|right|260px|Sounds can be represented as a mixture of their component [[Sine wave|Sinusoidal waves]] of different frequencies.

The horizontal axis represents time.]]\nAlthough there are many complexities relating to the transmission of sounds, at the point of reception (i.e. the ears), sound is readily dividable into two simple elements: pressure and time. These fundamental elements form the basis of all sound waves. They can be used to describe, in absolute terms, every sound we hear.\n\nHowever, in order to understand the sound more fully, a complex wave such as this is usually separated into its component parts, which are a combination of various sound wave frequencies (and noise).<ref name=\"Handel, S. 1995\">Handel, S.

Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT press.</ref>\n\nSound [[wave]]s are often simplified to a description in terms of [[Sine wave|sinusoidal]] [[plane wave]]s, which are characterized by these generic properties:\n* [[Frequency]], or its inverse, the [[Wavelength]]\n* [[Amplitude]]\n* [[Sound pressure]] / [[Sound intensity|Intensity]]\n* [[Speed of sound]]\n* [[Direction (geometry, geography)|Direction]]\n\nSound that is perceptible by humans has frequencies from about 20&nbsp;Hz to 20,000&nbsp;Hz. In air at [[standard temperature and pressure]], the corresponding wavelengths of sound waves range from 17&nbsp;m to 17&nbsp;mm.\nSometimes speed and direction are combined as a [[velocity]] [[Vector (geometric)|vector]]; wave number and direction are combined as a [[wave vector]].\n\n[[Transverse wave]]s, also known as [[Shear stress|shear]] waves, have the additional property, ''[[Polarization (waves)|polarization]]'', and are not a characteristic of sound waves.\n\n===Speed of sound===\n[[File:FA-18 Hornet breaking sound barrier (7 July 1999) - filtered.jpg|right|thumb|U.S. Navy [[F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18]] approaching the sound barrier. The white halo is formed by condensed water droplets thought to result from a drop in air pressure around the aircraft (see [[Prandtl-Glauert Singularity]]).<ref name=nasa>{{Cite APOD|title=A Sonic Boom|access-date=26 June 2015|date=19 August 2007}}</ref>]]\n<math></math>\nThe [[speed of sound]] depends on the medium that the waves pass through, and is a fundamental property of the material. The first significant effort towards the measure of the speed of sound was made by Newton. He believed that the speed of sound in a particular substance was equal to the square root of the pressure acting on it ([[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|STP]]) divided by its density.\n\n<math>\nc = \\sqrt{ {p \\over \\rho}}\\,\n</math>\n\nThis was later proven wrong when found to incorrectly derive the speed. French mathematician [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]] corrected the formula by deducing that the phenomenon of sound travelling is not isothermal, as believed by Newton, but [[Adiabatic process|adiabatic]]. He added another factor to the equation-''gamma''-and multiplied <math>\n\\sqrt{\\gamma}\\,\n</math> to <math>\\sqrt{ {p \\over \\rho}}\\,</math>, thus coming up with the equation <math>\nc = \\sqrt{\\gamma \\cdot {p \\over \\rho}}\\,\n</math> . Since <math>\nK = \\gamma \\cdot p\\,\n</math> the final equation came up to be <math>\nc = \\sqrt{\\frac{K}{\\rho}}\\,\n</math> which is also known as the Newton-Laplace equation. In this equation, K = elastic bulk modulus, c = velocity of sound, and <math> {\\rho}\\,</math> = density. Thus, the speed of sound is proportional to the [[square root]] of the [[ratio]] of the [[bulk modulus]] of the medium to its density.\n\nThose physical properties and the speed of sound change with ambient conditions. For example, the speed of sound in gases depends on [[temperature]]. In {{convert|20|C|F|lk=on}} air at [[sea level]], the speed of sound is approximately {{convert|343|m/s|km/h mph|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} using the formula \"v = (331 + 0.6 T)&nbsp;m/s\". In fresh water, also at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C, the speed of sound is approximately {{convert|1482|m/s|km/h mph|abbr=on|sigfig=4}}. In [[steel]], the speed of sound is about {{convert|5960|m/s|km/h mph|abbr=on|sigfig=4}}. The speed of sound is also slightly sensitive, being subject to a second-order [[Anharmonicity|anharmonic]] effect, to the sound amplitude, which means that there are non-linear propagation effects, such as the production of harmonics and mixed tones not present in the original sound (see [[parametric array]]).\n\n==Perception of sound==\nA distinct use of the term ''sound'' from its use in physics is that in physiology and psychology, where the term refers to the subject of ''perception'' by the brain. The field of [[psychoacoustics]] is dedicated to such studies. Historically the word \"sound\" referred exclusively to an effect in the mind. Webster's 1947 dictionary defined sound as: \"that which is heard; the effect which is produced by the vibration of a body affecting the ear.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Webster|first1=Noah|title= Sound. In Webster's New Twentieth Century Dictionary|date=1947|publisher=The World Publishing Company|location=Clevelend Ohio|pages =1621\u20132|edition=Revised}}</ref> This meant (at least in 1947) the correct response to the question: \"[[If a tree falls in a forest|if a tree falls in the forest with no one to hear it fall, does it make a sound?]]\" was \"no\". However, owing to contemporary usage, definitions of sound as a physical effect are prevalent in most dictionaries. Consequently, the answer to the same question (see above) is now \"yes, a tree falling in the forest with no one to hear it fall does make a sound\".\n\nThe physical reception of sound in any hearing organism is limited to a range of frequencies. Humans normally hear sound  frequencies between approximately 20 [[Hertz|Hz]] and 20,000&nbsp;Hz (20 [[kHz]]),{{r|Olson1967|page1=382}} The upper limit decreases with age.<ref name=\"Olson1967\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RUDTFBbb7jAC&pg=PA382|title=Music, Physics and Engineering|isbn=9780486217697|author1=Olson|first1=Harry F.

Other [[species]] have different ranges of hearing. For example, dogs can perceive vibrations higher than 20&nbsp;kHz, but are deaf below 40&nbsp;Hz.\n\nAs a signal perceived by one of the major [[sense]]s, sound is used by many species for [[defence mechanism (biology)|detecting danger]], [[navigation]], [[predation]], and [[communication]]. [[Earth]]'s [[atmosphere]], [[hydrosphere|water]], and virtually any [[physical phenomenon]], such as [[fire]], [[rain]], [[wind]], [[ocean surface wave|surf]], or [[earthquake]], produces (and is characterized by) its unique sounds. Many species, such as [[frog]]s, [[bird]]s, [[marine mammals|marine]] and terrestrial [[mammal]]s, have also developed special [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] to produce sound. In some species, these produce [[bird vocalization|song]] and [[speech communication|speech]]. Furthermore, [[human]]s have developed culture and technology (such as [[music]], [[telephone]] and [[radio]]) that allows them to generate, record, transmit, and broadcast sound.\n\n===Elements of sound perception===\n\n[[File:Pitch perception.png|thumb|upright|300px|Figure 1. Pitch perception]]\n[[File:Duration perception.png|thumb|upright|300px|Figure 2. Duration perception]]\nThere are six experimentally separable ways in which sound waves are analysed. They are:  [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], [[duration (music)|duration]], [[loudness]], [[timbre]], [[texture (music)|sonic texture]] and  [[Sound localization|spatial location]].<ref>Burton, R. L. (2015).

Paper presented at: Music: Educating for life: ASME XXth National Conference (pp.22 - 28), Parkville, Victoria: The Australian Society for Music Education Inc.</ref>\n\n====Pitch====\n[[Pitch (music)|Pitch]] is perceived as how \"low\" or \"high\" a sound is and represents the cyclic, repetitive nature of the vibrations that make up sound. For simple sounds, pitch relates to the frequency of the slowest vibration in the sound (called the fundamental harmonic). In the case of complex sounds, pitch perception can vary. Sometimes individuals identify different pitches for the same sound, based on their personal experience of particular sound patterns. Selection of a particular pitch is determined by pre-conscious examination of vibrations, including their frequencies and the balance between them. Specific attention is given to recognising potential harmonics.<ref>De Cheveigne, A. (2005). Pitch perception models. Pitch, 169-233.</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Krumbholz | first1 = K. | last2 = Patterson | first2 = R. | last3 = Seither-Preisler | first3 = A. | last4 = Lammertmann | first4 = C. | last5 = L\u00fctkenh\u00f6ner | first5 = B. | year = 2003 | title = Neuromagnetic evidence for a pitch processing center in Heschl's gyrus | url = | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 13 | issue = 7| pages = 765\u2013772 | doi=10.1093/cercor/13.7.765}}</ref>  Every sound is placed on a pitch continuum from low to high. For example: [[white noise]] (random noise spread evenly across all frequencies) sounds higher in pitch than [[pink noise]] (random noise spread evenly across octaves) as white noise has more high frequency content.  Figure 1 shows an example of pitch recognition. During the listening process, each sound is analysed for a repeating pattern (See Figure 1: orange arrows) and the results forwarded to the auditory cortex as a single pitch of a certain height (octave) and chroma (note name).\n\n====Duration====\n[[duration (music)|Duration]] is perceived as how \"long\" or \"short\" a sound is and relates to onset and offset signals created by nerve responses to sounds. The duration of a sound usually lasts from the time the sound is first noticed until the sound is identified as having changed or ceased.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = S. | last2 = Longe | first2 = O. | last3 = Pato | first3 = M.

For example; in a noisy environment, gapped sounds (sounds that stop and start) can sound as if they are continuous because the offset messages are missed owing to disruptions from noises in the same general bandwidth.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Nishihara | first1 = M. | last2 = Inui | first2 = K. | last3 = Morita | first3 = T. | last4 = Kodaira | first4 = M. | last5 = Mochizuki | first5 = H. | last6 = Otsuru | first6 = N. | last7 = Kakigi | first7 = R. | year = 2014 | title = Echoic memory: Investigation of its temporal resolution by auditory offset cortical responses | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 9 | issue = 8| page = e106553 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0106553}}</ref> This can be of great benefit in understanding distorted messages such as radio signals that suffer from interference, as (owing to this effect) the message is heard as if it was continuous. Figure 2 gives an example of duration identification. When a new sound is noticed (see Figure 2, Green arrows), a sound onset message is sent to the auditory cortex. When the repeating pattern is missed, a sound offset messages is sent.\n\n====Loudness====\n[[Loudness]] is perceived as how \"loud\" or \"soft\" a sound is and relates to the totalled number of auditory nerve stimulations over short cyclic time periods, most likely over the duration of theta wave cycles.<ref>{{citation |author=Corwin, J. |date=2009 |title=The auditory system |url=http://www.medicine.virginia.edu/basic-science/departments/neurosci/research/corwin-lab/educationresearch/handouts/Auditory-System-handout-revised-for-2009-by-JTC.pdf |access-date=2013-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Massaro | first1 = D.

Past around 200 ms this is no longer the case and the duration of the sound no longer affects the apparent loudness of the sound. Figure 3 gives an impression of how loudness information is summed over a period of about 200 ms before being sent to the auditory cortex. Louder signals create a greater 'push' on the Basilar membrane and thus stimulate more nerves,creating a stronger loudness signal. A more complex signal also creates more nerve firings and so sounds louder (for the same wave amplitude) than a simpler sound, such as a sine wave.\n\n====Timbre====\n[[Timbre]] is perceived as the quality of different sounds (e.g. the thud of a fallen rock, the whir of a drill, the tone of a musical instrument or the quality of a voice) and represents the pre-conscious allocation of a sonic identity to a sound (e.g. \u201cit\u2019s an oboe!\"). This identity is based on information gained from frequency transients, noisiness, unsteadiness, perceived pitch and the spread and intensity of overtones in the sound over an extended time frame.<ref name=\"Handel, S. 1995\"/><ref name=\"Kendall, R. A. 1986\"/><ref name=\"Matthews, M. 1999 pp. 79-88\"/> The way a sound changes over time (see figure 4) provides most of the information for timbre identification. Even though a small section of the wave form from each instrument looks very similar (see the expanded sections indicated by the orange arrows in figure 4), differences in changes over time between the clarinet and the piano are evident in both loudness and harmonic content. Less noticeable are the different noises heard, such as air hisses for the clarinet and hammer strikes for the piano.\n{|style=\"margin: 0 auto;\"\n|[[File:Loudness perception v5.gif|thumb|upright=2.0|Figure 3.

The texture of a market place is very different to a school hall because of the differences in the various sound sources.\n\n====Spatial location====\nSpatial location (see: [[Sound localization]]) represents the cognitive placement of a sound in an environmental context; including the placement of a sound on both the horizontal and vertical plane, the distance from the sound source and the characteristics of the sonic environment.<ref name=\"Cariani, P. 2012 pp. 351-390\"/><ref>Levitin, D.

It is the main reason why we can pick the sound of an oboe in an orchestra and the words of a single person at a cocktail party.\n\n{{Sound measurements}}\n\n===Noise===\n[[Noise]] is a term often used to refer to an unwanted sound. In science and engineering, noise is an undesirable component that obscures a wanted signal. However, in sound perception it can often be used to identify the source of a sound and is an important component of timbre perception (see above).\n\n===Soundscape===\n[[Soundscape]] is the component of the acoustic environment that can be perceived by humans. The acoustic environment is the combination of all sounds (whether audible to humans or not) within a given area as modified by the environment and understood by people, in context of the surrounding environment.\n\n==Sound pressure level==\n{{main article|Sound pressure level}}\n[[Sound pressure]] is the difference, in a given medium, between average local pressure and the pressure in the sound wave. A square of this difference (i.e., a square of the deviation from the equilibrium pressure) is usually averaged over time and/or space, and a square root of this average provides a [[root mean square]] (RMS) value. For example, 1 [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] RMS sound pressure (94 dBSPL) in atmospheric air implies that the actual pressure in the sound wave oscillates between (1 atm <math>-\\sqrt{2}</math> Pa) and (1 atm <math>+\\sqrt{2}</math> Pa), that is between 101323.6 and 101326.4 Pa.\nAs the human ear can detect sounds with a wide range of amplitudes, sound pressure is often measured as a level on a logarithmic [[decibel]] scale. The '''sound pressure level''' (SPL) or ''L''<sub>p</sub> is defined as\n:<math>\nL_\\mathrm{p}=10\\, \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{{p}^2}{{p_\\mathrm{ref}}^2}\\right) =20\\, \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{p}{p_\\mathrm{ref}}\\right)\\mbox{ dB}\\,\n</math>\n\n:where ''p'' is the [[root-mean-square]] sound pressure and <math>p_\\mathrm{ref}</math> is a reference sound pressure. Commonly used reference sound pressures, defined in the standard [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] [[ANSI S1.1-1994|S1.1-1994]], are 20 [[micropascal|\u00b5Pa]] in air and 1 [[micropascal|\u00b5Pa]] in water. Without a specified reference sound pressure, a value expressed in decibels cannot represent a sound pressure level.\n\nSince the human [[ear]] does not have a flat [[Responsivity|spectral response]], sound pressures are often [[frequency]] weighted so that the measured level matches perceived levels more closely. The [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) has defined several weighting schemes. [[A-weighting]] attempts to match the response of the human ear to noise and A-weighted sound pressure levels are labeled dBA. C-weighting is used to measure peak levels.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n;Sound sources: [[musical instrument]], [[sound box]], [[earphones]], [[sonar]], [[sound reproduction]], \n;Sound entertainment: [[Radio]], [[Music]]\n;Sound measurement:\n* [[Decibel]], [[Sone]], [[Mel scale|mel]], [[Phon]], [[Hertz]]\n* [[Sound pressure level]], [[Sound pressure]]\n* [[Particle velocity]], [[Acoustic velocity]]\n* [[Particle displacement]], [[Particle amplitude]], [[Particle acceleration]]\n* [[Sound power]], [[Sound power level]]\n* [[Sound energy flux]]\n* [[Sound intensity]], [[Sound intensity level]]\n* [[Acoustic impedance]], [[Sound impedance]], [[Characteristic impedance]]\n* [[Speed of sound]], [[Amplitude]]\n;General:\n* [[Acoustic theory]]\n* [[Beat (acoustics)|Beat]]\n* [[Doppler effect]]\n* [[Echo (phenomenon)|Echo]]\n* [[Musical tone]]\n* [[Pitch (music)|Pitch]]\n* [[Resonance]]\n* [[Reverberation]]\n* [[Sonic weaponry]]\n* [[Sound localization]]\n* [[Soundproofing]]\n* [[Structural acoustics]]\n* [[Timbre]]\n* [[Ultrasound]]\n* [[List of unexplained sounds]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{wikibooks}}\n{{commons category}}\n{{Wikisource}}\n{{Library resources box \n|by=no \n|onlinebooks=no \n|others=no \n|about=yes \n|label=Sound }}\n* [http://www.acoustics.salford.ac.uk/schools/index1.htm Sounds Amazing; a KS3/4 learning resource for sound and waves]\n* [http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/sound/soucon.html HyperPhysics: Sound and Hearing]\n* [http://podcomplex.com/guide/physics.html Introduction to the Physics of Sound]\n* [http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/~jw/hearing.html Hearing curves and on-line hearing test]\n* [http://www.audiodesignline.com/howto/audioprocessing/193303241 Audio for the 21st Century]\n* [http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-soundlevel.htm Conversion of sound units and levels]\n* [http://www.sengpielaudio.com/Calculations03.htm Sound calculations]\n* [http://www.audiocheck.net Audio Check: a free collection of audio tests and test tones playable on-line]\n* [http://www.acoustics.salford.ac.uk/feschools/ More Sounds Amazing; a sixth-form learning resource about sound waves]\n\n{{Acoustics}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Hearing]]\n[[Category:Waves]]\n[[Category:Qualia]]\n[[Category:Sound]]"}]}}}}
