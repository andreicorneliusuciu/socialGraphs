However, this can be avoided if a DAW switches from integer to [[Floating-point arithmetic|floating-point]] arithmetic.  This usually entails some loss of precision although the final precision should still be significantly better than that which is needed for the final music processing.  \n\nThe signal passes through an [[Anti-aliasing filter|anti-aliasing]], [[Sample rate conversion|resampling]], or [[reconstruction filter]], which may increase peak amplitude slightly due to the [[Gibbs phenomenon]] (The Gibbs Phenomenon is a mathematical concept and only applies to one point so in practice it is irrelevant to real life circuits and devices). It is possible,  for the ''analog'' signal ''represented'' by the digital data to exceed digital full scale even if the digital data does not, and vice versa.  In the analog domain there is no peak/clipping problem unless the d/a analog circuitry was badly designed. In the digital domain there are no peaks created by these conversions. \n  \nIn analog systems, full scale may be defined by the maximum voltage available, or the maximum deflection ('''full scale deflection''' or '''FSD''') or indication of an analog instrument such as a moving coil meter or [[galvanometer]].\n\nIf a proper (no clipping/saturation) analog signal is converted to digital via A/D with sufficient samples, and then reconverted to analog via D/A then  Nyquist theorem guarantees that there will be no problem in the analog domain due to \"peak\" issues because the restored analog signal will be an exact copy of the original analog signal.\n\n==See also==\n* [[dBFS]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Full Scale}}\n[[Category:Digital signal processing]]\n[[Category:Digital audio]]"}]}}}}
