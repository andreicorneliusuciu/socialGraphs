It is a commonly used term in electronics, mathematics, sound, and image processing.\n\n==In electronics==\nIn [[alternating current]], the '''zero-crossing''' is the instantaneous point at which there is no [[voltage]] present.  In a [[sine wave]] or other simple [[waveform]], this normally occurs twice during each [[interval (time)|cycle]].\n\nThe zero-crossing is important for systems which send [[Digital data|digital]] [[data]] over AC [[electrical network|circuits]], such as [[modem]]s, [[X10 (industry standard)|X10]] [[home automation]] [[control system]]s, and [[Digital Command Control]] type systems for [[Lionel Corporation|Lionel]] and other AC [[model train]]s.\n\nCounting zero-crossings is also a method used in [[speech processing]] to estimate the [[fundamental frequency]] of speech.\n\nIn a system where an amplifier with digitally controlled gain is applied to an input signal, artifacts in the non-zero output signal occur when the gain of the amplifier is abruptly switched between its discrete gain settings. At audio frequencies, such as in modern consumer electronics like [[digital audio player]]s, these effects are clearly audible, resulting in a 'zipping' sound when rapidly ramping the gain, or a soft 'click' when a single gain change is made.  [[Artifact (error)|Artifacts]] are disconcerting and clearly not desirable. If changes are made only at zero-crossings of the input signal, then no matter how the amplifier gain setting changes, the output also remains at zero, thereby minimizing the change.  (The instantaneous change in gain will still produce distortion, but will not produce a click.)\n\nIf electrical power is to be switched, no [[electrical interference]] is generated if switched at an instant when there is no current\u2014a zero crossing. Early light [[dimmer]]s and similar devices generated interference; later versions were designed to switch at the zero crossing.\n\n==In image processing==\nIn the field of [[Digital data|Digital]] [[Image Processing]], great emphasis is placed on operators which seek out edges within an image.  They are called 'Edge Detection' or 'Gradient filters'.  A [[edge detection|gradient filter]] is a filter which seeks out areas of rapid change in pixel value.  These points usually mark an edge or a boundary.  A Laplace filter is a filter which fits in this family, though it sets about the task in a different way.  It seeks out points in the signal stream where the digital signal of an image passes through a pre-set '0' value, and marks this out as a potential edge point.  Because the signal has crossed through the point of zero, it is called a '''zero-crossing'''.   An example can be found [http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/zerocdemo.htm here], including the source in Java.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Reconstruction from zero crossings]]\n* [[Zero-crossing rate]]\n* [[Root of a function]]\n* [[Sign function]]\n\n[[Category:Signal processing]]"}]}}}}
