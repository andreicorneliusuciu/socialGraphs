There are many different standards and types of horsepower. Two common definitions in use today are the '''mechanical horsepower''' (or '''imperial horsepower'''), which for example approximately 745.7 watts; and the '''metric horsepower''', which is approximately 735.5 watts.\n\nThe term was adopted in the late 18th century by [[Scottish people|Scottish]] engineer [[James Watt]] to compare the output of [[steam engine]]s with the power of [[draft horse]]s. It was later expanded to include the output power of other types of [[piston engines]], as well as [[turbine]]s, [[electric motor]]s and other machinery.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/272384/horsepower \"Horsepower\"], ''Encyclopedia Britannica Online''.

It was used for rating steam [[boiler]]s and is equivalent to 34.5 pounds (about 15.6&nbsp;kg) of water evaporated per hour at 212 degrees [[Fahrenheit]] (100 degrees Celsius).\n* One horsepower for rating [[electric motor]]s is equal to 746 watts.\n* One horsepower for rating Continental European electric motors is equal to 735&nbsp;watts.

It is one of the [[tax horsepower]] systems adopted around Europe.\n\n==History of the unit==\n\nThe development of the [[steam engine]] provided a reason to compare the output of horses with that of the engines that could replace them. In 1702, [[Thomas Savery]] wrote in ''The Miner's Friend'':\n\n<blockquote>So that an engine which will raise as much water as two horses, working together at one time in such a work, can do, and for which there must be constantly kept ten or twelve horses for doing the same. Then I say, such an engine may be made large enough to do the work required in employing eight, ten, fifteen, or twenty horses to be constantly maintained and kept for doing such a work\u2026<ref>[http://www.history.rochester.edu/steam/savery/ Rochester history department website: \"The miner's friend\"] Accessed July 21, 2011</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe idea was later used by [[James Watt (inventor)|James Watt]] to help market his improved steam engine.  He had previously agreed to take royalties of one third of the savings in coal from the older [[Newcomen steam engine]]s.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.pballew.net/arithm17.html#hp |title=Math Words \u2014 horsepower |publisher= pballew.net |accessdate=2007-08-11 |postscript=  }}</ref>  This royalty scheme did not work with customers who did not have existing steam engines but used horses instead.\n\nWatt determined that a horse could turn a [[Horse mill|mill wheel]] 144 times in an hour (or 2.4 times a minute).<ref name=Engineers121>Hart-Davis, Adam, ''Engineers'', pub Dorling Kindersley, 2012, p121.</ref>  The wheel was {{convert|12|ft}} in radius; therefore, the horse travelled 2.4 \u00d7 2\u03c0 \u00d7 12 feet in one minute.

Watt, while aware of the trick, accepted the challenge and built a machine which was actually even stronger than the figure achieved by the brewer, and it was the output of that machine which became the horsepower.<ref>''[[Popular Mechanics]]''.

This hydraulic power, considerably more than this, may also be used to drive a down-hole mud motor to power [[directional drilling]].<ref name=\"Schlumberger, Hydraulic horsepower\" />\n\n=== Boiler horsepower ===\nBoiler horsepower is a [[steam boiler|boiler]]'s capacity to deliver [[steam]] to a [[steam engine]] and is not the same unit of power as the 550&nbsp;ft-lb/s definition. One boiler horsepower is equal to the thermal energy rate required to evaporate 34.5&nbsp;lb of fresh water at 212&nbsp;\u00b0F in one hour. In the early days of steam use, the boiler horsepower was roughly comparable to the horsepower of engines fed by the boiler.<ref>Robert McCain Johnston ''Elements of Applied Thermodynamics'', Naval Institute Press, 1992 ISBN 1557502269,  p.503</ref>\n\nThe term \"boiler horsepower\" was originally developed at the [[Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition]] in 1876, where the best steam engines of that period were tested.  The average steam consumption of those engines (per output horsepower) was determined to be the evaporation of 30 pounds of water per hour, based on feed water at 100&nbsp;\u00b0F, and saturated steam generated at 70 [[psig]].  This original definition is equivalent to a boiler heat output of 33,485 Btu/hr.  Years later in 1884, the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers|ASME]] re-defined the boiler horsepower as the thermal output equal to the evaporation of 34.5 pounds per hour of water \"from and at\" 212&nbsp;\u00b0F.  This considerably simplified boiler testing, and provided more accurate comparisons of the boilers at that time. This revised definition is equivalent to a boiler heat output of 33,469 Btu/hr.  Present industrial practice is to define \"boiler horsepower\" as a boiler thermal output equal to 33,475 Btu/hr, which is very close to the original and revised definitions.\n\nBoiler horsepower is still used to measure boiler output in industrial boiler engineering in Australia, the US, and New Zealand. Boiler horsepower is abbreviated BHP, not to be confused with brake horsepower, below, which is also called BHP.\n\n===Drawbar horsepower===\n{{See also|Power at rail}}\n\nDrawbar horsepower (dbhp) is the power a [[railway]] [[locomotive]] has available to haul a [[train]] or an agricultural tractor to pull an implement. This is a measured figure rather than a calculated one. A special [[railway car]] called a [[dynamometer car]] coupled behind the locomotive keeps a continuous record of the [[drawbar (haulage)|drawbar]] pull exerted, and the speed. From these, the power generated can be calculated. To determine the maximum power available, a controllable load is required; it is normally a second locomotive with its brakes applied, in addition to a static load.\n\nIf the drawbar force (<math>F</math>) is measured in pounds-force (lbf) and speed (<math>v</math>) is measured in miles per hour (mph), then the drawbar power (<math>P</math>) in horsepower (hp) is:\n\n:<math>P / {\\rm hp} = {(F / {\\rm lbf}) (v / {\\rm mph}) \\over 375}</math>\n\nExample: How much power is needed to pull a drawbar load of 2,025 pounds-force at 5 miles per hour?\n\n:<math>P / {\\rm hp} = {{2025 \\times 5 } \\over 375} = 27</math>\n\nThe constant 375 is because 1&nbsp;hp = 375&nbsp;lbf\u00b7mph. If other units are used, the constant is different. When using coherent [[SI]] units (watts, newtons, and metres per second), no constant is needed, and the formula becomes <math>P = Fv</math>.\n\nThis formula may also be used to calculate the horsepower of a jet engine, using the speed of the jet and the thrust required to maintain that speed.\n\nExample: How much power is generated with a thrust of 4,000 pounds at 400 miles per hour?\n\n:<math>P / {\\rm hp} = {{4000 \\times 400 } \\over 375} = 4266.666666666667</math>\n\n===RAC horsepower (taxable horsepower)===\n\n{{See also|Tax horsepower}}\nThis measure was instituted by the [[Royal Automobile Club]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and was used to denote the power of early 20th-century British [[automobile|cars]]. (An identical measure, known as [[ALAM]] horsepower or [[National Automobile Chamber of Commerce|NACC]] horsepower, was used for early U.S. automobiles.) Many cars took their names from this figure (hence the [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]] Seven and [[Riley (automobile)|Riley]] Nine), while others had names such as \"40/50 hp\", which indicated the RAC figure followed by the true measured power.\n\nTaxable horsepower does not reflect developed horsepower; rather, it is a calculated figure based on the engine's bore size, number of cylinders, and a (now archaic) presumption of engine efficiency. As new engines were designed with ever-increasing efficiency, it was no longer a useful measure, but was kept in use by UK regulations which used the rating for [[tax horsepower|tax purposes]].\n\n:<math>\\text{RAC h.p.}=\\frac{2}{5}D^2 n</math>\n\n:where\n\n: ''D'' is the diameter (or [[Bore (engine)|bore]]) of the cylinder in inches\n: ''n'' is the number of cylinders <ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.designchambers.com/wolfhound/wolfhoundRACHP.htm |title= The RAC HP (horsepower) Rating - Was there any technical basis? |first= Richard |last= Hodgson |publisher=wolfhound.org.uk |accessdate=2007-08-11 |postscript=}}</ref>\n\nThis is equal to the [[engine displacement]] in cubic inches divided by 0.625\u03c0 then divided again by the [[Stroke (engine)|stroke]] in inches.\n\nSince taxable horsepower was computed based on bore and number of cylinders, not based on actual displacement, it gave rise to engines with 'undersquare' dimensions (bore smaller than stroke) this tended to impose an artificially low limit on rotational speed ([[revolutions per minute|rpm]]), hampering the potential power output and efficiency of the engine.\n\nThe situation persisted for several generations of four- and six-cylinder British engines: for example, [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar's]] 3.4-litre XK engine of the 1950s had six cylinders with a bore of {{convert|83|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} and a stroke of {{convert|106|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}},<ref>{{Cite web |first= Dan |last= Mooney |url= http://www.classicjaguar.com/xkengine.html |title= The XK engine by Roger Bywater |publisher= Classicjaguar.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-13 |postscript= }}</ref> where most American automakers had long since moved to oversquare (large bore, short stroke) [[V8 engine|V-8s]] (see, for example, the early [[Chrysler FirePower engine|Chrysler Hemi]]).\n\n==Measurement==\n\nThe power of an engine may be measured or estimated at several points in the transmission of the power from its generation to its application. A number of names are used for the power developed at various stages in this process, but none is a clear indicator of either the measurement system or definition used.\n\nIn the case of an engine [[dynamometer]], power is measured at the engine's [[flywheel]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Also, with a chassis dynamometer or ''rolling road'', power output is measured at the driving wheels. This accounts for energy or power loss through the drive train inefficiencies and weight thereof as well as gravitational force placed upon components therein.\n\nIn general:\n:[[#Nominal (or rated) horsepower (nhp or rhp)|Nominal]] or rated horsepower is derived from the size of the engine and the piston speed and is only accurate at a pressure of {{convert|48|kPa|psi|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Brown>Brown, DK ''Before the ironclad'', pub Conway, 1990,  p188.</ref>{{clarify|reason=pressure of what?|date=November 2015}}\n\n:[[#Indicated horsepower|Indicated]] or gross horsepower (theoretical capability of the engine)  [ PLAN/ 33000]\n::minus frictional losses within the engine (bearing drag, rod and crankshaft windage losses, oil film drag, etc.), equals\n:[[#Brake horsepower|Brake]] / net / crankshaft horsepower (power delivered directly to and measured at the engine's crankshaft)\n::minus frictional losses in the transmission (bearings, gears, oil drag, windage, etc.), equals\n:[[#Shaft horsepower|Shaft]] horsepower (power delivered to and measured at the output shaft of the transmission, when present in the system)\n::minus frictional losses in the universal joint/s, differential, wheel bearings, tire and chain, (if present), equals\n:[[#Effective horsepower (ehp)|Effective]], True (thp) or commonly referred to as wheel horsepower (whp)\n\nAll the above assumes that no power inflation factors have been applied to any of the readings.\n\nEngine designers use expressions other than horsepower to denote objective targets or performance, such as brake mean effective pressure (BMEP). This is a coefficient of theoretical brake horsepower and cylinder pressures during combustion.\n\n===<span id=\"nhp\"></span>Nominal (or rated) horsepower (nhp or rhp)===\nNominal horsepower (nhp) is an early 19th-century [[rule of thumb]] used to estimate the power of steam engines.<ref name=\"Brown\" />\n\nnhp = 7 x area of piston x equivalent piston speed/33,000\n\nFor paddle ships the piston speed was estimated as 129.7 x (stroke)<sup>1/3.35</sup>.<ref name=\"Brown\" />\n\nThe stroke was the distance moved by the piston.\n\nFor the nominal horsepower to equal the actual power it would be necessary for the mean steam pressure in the cylinder during the stroke to be {{convert|48|kPa|psi|0|abbr=on}} and for the piston speed to be of the order of 54\u201375&nbsp;m/min.<ref name=\"Brown\" />\n\nThe French Navy used the same definition of nominal horse power as Britain.<ref name=\"Brown\" />\n\n===Indicated horsepower (ihp) {{anchor|Indicated horsepower}}===\nIndicated horsepower (ihp) is the theoretical power of a reciprocating engine if it is completely frictionless in converting the expanding gas energy (piston pressure \u00d7 displacement) in the cylinders.  It is calculated from the pressures developed in the cylinders, measured by a device called an ''[[indicator diagram|engine indicator]]'' \u2013 hence indicated horsepower. As the piston advances throughout its stroke, the pressure against the piston generally decreases, and the indicator device usually generates a graph of pressure vs stroke within the working cylinder. From this graph the amount of work performed during the piston stroke may be calculated.\n\nIndicated horsepower was a better measure of engine power than nominal horsepower (nhp) because it took account of steam pressure.  But unlike later measures such as shaft horsepower (shp) and brake horsepower (bhp), it did not take into account power losses due to the machinery internal frictional losses, such as a piston sliding within the cylinder, plus bearing friction, transmission and gear box friction, etc.\n\n=== {{anchor|brake horsepower|bhp}} Brake horsepower (bhp) ===\n\nIt is the measure of an engine's horsepower before the loss in power caused by the gearbox and drive train.\n\nIn Europe the DIN standard tested the engine fitted with all ancillaries and exhaust system as used in the car. The American SAE system tests without alternator, water pump, and other auxiliary components such as power steering pump, muffled exhaust system, etc. so the figures are higher than the European figures for the same engine. Brake refers to the device which was used to load an engine and hold it at a desired rotational speed. During testing, the output torque and rotational speed were measured to determine the brake horsepower. Horsepower was originally measured and calculated by use of the \"indicator diagram\" (a James Watt invention of the late 18th century), and later by means of a [[Prony brake]] connected to the engine's output shaft.\n\nMore recently, an electrical brake [[dynamometer]] is used instead of a Prony brake. Although the output delivered to the driving wheels is less than that obtainable at the engine's crankshaft, a chassis dynamometer gives an indication of an engine's \"real world\" horsepower after losses in the drive train and gearbox.\n\n===Shaft horsepower (shp)===\nShaft horsepower (shp) is the power delivered to the [[propeller]] shafts of a [[steamship]] (or one powered by [[diesel engine]]s or [[nuclear power]]), or an [[aircraft]] powered by a [[piston engine]] or a [[gas turbine]] engine, and the rotors of a helicopter. This shaft horsepower can be measured with [[Measuring instrument|instruments]], or estimated from the indicated horsepower and a standard figure for the losses in the transmission (typical figures are around 10%). This measure is not commonly used in the [[automobile]] industry, because in that context drive train losses can become significant.\n\n===Wheel horsepower (whp)===\n\nMotor vehicle dynamometers are used which measure the actual horsepower delivered to the driving wheel(s), which represents the actual usable power levels available considering all losses in the drive train, and all parasitic losses such as pumps, fans, alternator, etc.  The vehicle is generally attached to the dynamometer and accelerates a large roller and Power Absorbing Unit which is driven by the vehicle's drive wheel(s).  The actual power is then computer calculated based on the rotational inertia of the roller, its resultant acceleration rates and power applied by the Power Absorbing Unit. Some motor vehicle (and motorbike) dynamometers can also be purely inertia-based where the power output is calculated from measuring the acceleration of a roller drum with a known rotational inertia and known parasitic frictional losses of the roller drum's bearings.\n\n==Engine power test standards==\nThere exist a number of different standard determining how the power and torque of an automobile engine is measured and corrected. Correction factors are used to adjust power and torque measurements to standard atmospheric conditions, to provide a more accurate comparison between engines as they are affected by the pressure, humidity, and temperature of ambient air.<ref>Heywood, J.B. \"Internal Combustion Engine Fundamentals\", ISBN 0-07-100499-8, page 54</ref> Some standards are described below.\n\n===Society of Automotive Engineers/SAE International===\n\n====Early \"SAE horsepower\" (see [[Horsepower#RAC horsepower (taxable horsepower)|RAC horsepower]])====\nIn the early twentieth century, a so-called \"SAE horsepower\" was sometimes quoted for U.S. automobiles. This long predates the SAE horsepower measurement standards and was really just another term for the widely used ALAM or NACC horsepower figure, which was the same as the British RAC horsepower, used for tax purposes.\n\n====SAE gross power====\nPrior to the 1972 model year, American automakers rated and advertised their engines in brake horsepower (bhp), frequently referred to as SAE gross horsepower, because it was measured in accord with the protocols defined in [[Society of Automotive Engineers|SAE]] standards J245 and J1995. As with other brake horsepower test protocols, SAE gross hp was measured using a stock test engine, without accessories (such as dynamo/alternator, radiator fan, water pump),<ref name=\"Lucchesi\" /> and sometimes fitted with long tube test [[Exhaust manifold|headers]] in lieu of the [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] exhaust manifolds. The atmospheric correction standards for barometric pressure, humidity and temperature for testing were relatively idealistic.\n\n====SAE net power====\nIn the United States, the term ''bhp'' fell into disuse in 1971\u20131972, as automakers began to quote power in terms of SAE net horsepower in accord with SAE standard J1349. Like SAE gross and other brake horsepower protocols, SAE Net hp is measured at the engine's crankshaft, and so does not account for transmission losses. However, the SAE net power testing protocol calls for standard production-type belt-driven accessories, air cleaner, emission controls, exhaust system, and other power-consuming accessories. This produces ratings in closer alignment with the power produced by the engine as it is actually configured and sold.\n\n====SAE certified power====\nIn 2005, the SAE introduced \"SAE Certified Power\" with SAE J2723.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sae.org/certifiedpower/ |title=Certified Power - SAE J1349 Certified Power SAE International |publisher=Sae.org |date= |accessdate=2011-07-18}}</ref> This test is voluntary and is in itself not a separate engine test code but a certification of either J1349 or J1995 after which the manufacturer is allowed to advertise \"Certified to SAE J1349\" or \"Certified to SAE J1995\" depending on which test standard have been followed. To attain certification the test must follow the SAE standard in question, take place in an ISO9000/9002 certified facility and be witnessed by an SAE approved third party.\n\nA few manufacturers such as Honda and Toyota switched to the new ratings immediately, with multi-directional results; the rated output of [[Cadillac|Cadillac's]] [[supercharger|supercharged]] [[GM Premium V engine#Supercharged|Northstar]] V8 jumped from {{convert|440|to|469|hp|kW|abbr=on}} under the new tests, while the rating for [[Toyota Motor Corporation|Toyota's]] [[Toyota Camry|Camry]] 3.0&nbsp;L ''[[Toyota MZ engine#1MZ-FE|1MZ-FE]]'' V6 fell from {{convert|210|to|190|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. The company's Lexus ES 330 and Camry SE V6 were previously rated at {{convert|225|hp|kW|abbr=on}} but the ES 330 dropped to {{convert|218|hp|kW|abbr=on}} while the Camry declined to {{convert|210|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. The first engine certified under the new program was the 7.0&nbsp;L [[GM LS engine#7.0 L|LS7]] used in the 2006 [[Chevrolet Corvette]] Z06.  Certified power rose slightly from {{convert|500|to|505|hp|kW|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}.\n\nWhile Toyota and Honda are retesting their entire vehicle lineups, other automakers generally are retesting only those with updated powertrains. For example, the 2006 Ford Five Hundred is rated at 203 horsepower, the same as that of 2005 model. However, the 2006 rating does not reflect the new SAE testing procedure, as Ford is not going to incur the extra expense of retesting its existing engines. Over time, most automakers are expected to comply with the new guidelines.\n\nSAE tightened its horsepower rules to eliminate the opportunity for engine manufacturers to manipulate factors affecting performance such as how much oil was in the crankcase, engine control system calibration, and whether an engine was tested with premium fuel. In some cases, such can add up to a change in horsepower ratings. A road test editor at Edmunds.com, John Di Pietro, said decreases in horsepower ratings for some 2006 models are not that dramatic. For vehicles like a midsize family sedan, it is likely that the reputation of the manufacturer will be more important.<ref>Jeff Plungis, ''Asians Oversell Horsepower'', Detroit News</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|DIN|70020}}''Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung'' 70020===\nDIN 70020 is a standard from [[Germany|German]] [[DIN]] regarding road vehicles.
