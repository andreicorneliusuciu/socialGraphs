Each font was a matched set of type, one piece (called a \"[[Sort (typesetting)|sort]]\") for each [[glyph]], and a typeface consisting of a range of fonts that shared an overall design.\n\nIn modern usage, with the advent of [[digital typography]], \"font\" is frequently synonymous with \"typeface\", although the two terms do not necessarily mean the same thing. In particular, the use of [[computer font|\"vector\" or \"outline\" font]]s means that different sizes of a typeface can be dynamically generated from one design. Each style may still be in a separate \"font file\"\u2014for instance, the typeface \"[[Bulmer (typeface)|Bulmer]]\" may include the fonts \"Bulmer [[roman type|roman]]\", \"Bulmer [[italic type|italic]]\", \"Bulmer [[boldface|bold]]\" and \"Bulmer extended\"\u2014but the term \"font\" might be applied either to one of these alone or to the whole typeface.\n[[File:Friedlaender.webmsd.webm|thumb|Israeli typographer [[Henri Friedlaender]] examines ''Hadassah Hebrew'' typeface sketches. The sequence was shot in his study in [[Motza Illit]] (near Jerusalem) in 1978.]]\n\n==Etymology==\n{{wiktionary}}\nThe word ''font'' (traditionally spelled ''fount'' in [[British English]], but in any case pronounced {{IPAc-en|f|\u0252|n|t}}) derives from [[Middle French]] ''fonte'' \"[something that has been] melted; a [[casting (metalworking)|casting]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=font |title=font |year=2001 |author=Douglas Harper |website=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |accessdate=2013-07-19 }}</ref> The term refers to the process of casting metal type at a [[type foundry]].\n\n==Metal type==\nIn a manual printing ([[letterpress]]) house the word \"font\" would refer to a complete set of [[typeface|metal type]] that would be used to [[typesetting|typeset]] an entire page. Unlike a digital typeface it would not include a single definition of each character, but commonly used characters (such as vowels and periods) would have more physical type-pieces included. A font when bought new would often be sold as (for example in a Roman alphabet) 12pt 14A 34a, meaning that it would be a size 12-point font containing 14 uppercase \"A\"s, and 34 lowercase \"A\"s. \n\nGiven the name upper and lowercase because of which case the metal type was located in, otherwise known as majuscule and minuscule. The rest of the characters would be provided in quantities appropriate for the [[Letter_frequency|distribution]] of letters in that language. Some metal type characters required in typesetting, such as [[em dash|dashes]], spaces and line-height spacers, were not part of a specific font, but were generic pieces which could be used with any font.<ref>{{cite web | title = Basic Letterpress Tools | url=http://my.execpc.com/~bosshard/printing/letrprss/basictools.html | accessdate = 2008-12-07}}</ref> Line spacing is still often called \"[[leading]]\", because the strips used for line spacing were made of [[lead]] (rather than the harder alloy used for other pieces). The reason for this spacing strip being made from \"lead\" was because lead was a softer metal than the traditional forged metal type pieces (which was part lead, antimony and tin) and would compress more easily when \"locked-up\" in the printing \"chase\" (i.e. a carrier for holding all the type together).\n\nIn the 1880s\u201390s, \"hot lead\" typesetting was invented, in which type was cast as it was set, either piece by piece (as in the [[Monotype System|Monotype]] technology) or in entire lines of type at one time (as in the [[Linotype machine|Linotype]] technology).\n\n==Font characteristics==\nIn addition to the character height, when using the mechanical sense of the term, there are several characteristics which may distinguish fonts, though they would also depend on the [[writing system|script]](s) that the typeface supports. In European [[alphabet|alphabetic scripts]], i.e. [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] and [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], the main such properties are the [[#Weight|stroke width, called weight]], the [[#Slope|style or angle]] and the [[#Width|character width]].\n\nThe regular or standard font is sometimes labeled ''roman'', both to distinguish it from ''bold'' or ''thin'' and from ''italic'' or ''oblique''. The keyword for the default, regular case is often omitted for variants and never repeated, otherwise it would be ''Bulmer regular italic'', ''Bulmer bold regular'' and even ''Bulmer regular regular''. ''Roman'' can also refer to the language coverage of a font, acting as a shorthand for \"Western European\".\n\nDifferent fonts of the same typeface may be used in the same work for various degrees of readability and [[emphasis (typography)|emphasis]], or in a specific design to make it be of more visual interest.\n\n===Weight===\nThe weight of a particular font is the thickness of the character outlines relative to their height.\n\n[[File:Helvetica Neue typeface weights.svg|thumb|[[Helvetica|Helvetica Neue]] weights]]\nA typeface may come in fonts of many weights, from ultra-light to extra-bold or black; four to six weights are not unusual, and a few typefaces have as many as a dozen. Many typefaces for office, web and non-professional use come with just a normal and a bold weight which are linked together. If no bold weight is provided, many renderers (browsers, word processors, graphic and DTP programs) support faking a bolder font by rendering the outline a second time at an offset, or just smearing it slightly at a diagonal angle.\n\nThe base weight differs among typefaces; that means one ''normal'' font may appear bolder than some other ''normal'' font. For example, fonts intended to be used in posters are often quite bold by default while fonts for long runs of text are rather light. Therefore, weight designations in font names may differ in regard to the actual absolute stroke weight or density of glyphs in the font.\n\nAttempts to systematize a range of weights led to a numerical classification first used by [[Adrian Frutiger]] with the [[Univers]] typeface: 35 ''Extra Light'', 45 ''Light'', 55 ''Medium'' or ''Regular'', 65 ''Bold'', 75 ''Extra Bold'', 85 ''Extra Bold'', 95 ''Ultra Bold'' or ''Black''.\nDeviants of these were the \"6 series\" (italics), e.g. ''46 Light Italics'' etc., the \"7 series\" (condensed versions), e.g. ''57 Medium Condensed'' etc., and the \"8 series\" (condensed italics), e.g. 68 ''Bold Condensed Italics''.\nFrom this brief numerical system it is easier to determine exactly what a font's characteristics are, for instance \"Helvetica 67\" (HE67) translates to \"Helvetica Bold Condensed\".\n\nThe [[TrueType]] font format introduced a scale from 100 through 900, which is also used in [[Cascading Stylesheets|CSS]] and [[OpenType]], where 400 is regular (roman or plain). The first algorithmic description of fonts was perhaps made by [[Donald Knuth]] in his [[Metafont]] and [[TeX]] system of programs.\n\n[[File:Regular and bold.png|thumb|Regular and bold versions of three common fonts. [[Helvetica]] has a quite monoline design and all strokes increase in weight; less monoline fonts like [[Optima]] and [[Utopia (typeface)|Utopia]] increase the weight of the thicker strokes more and thinner strokes less in bold. In all three designs, the curve on 'n' thins as as it joins the left-hand vertical.]]\nThere are many names used to describe the weight of a font in its name, differing among type foundries and designers, but their relative order is usually fixed, something like this:\n* Hairline\n* Thin\n* Ultra-light\n* Extra-light\n* Light\n* Book\n* Normal / regular / plain\n* Medium\n* Demi-bold / semi-bold\n* Bold\n* Extra-bold / extra\n* Heavy\n* Black\n* Extra-black\n* Ultra-black / ultra\nThe terms ''normal'', ''regular'' and ''plain'', sometimes also ''book'', are being used for the standard weight font of a typeface. Where both appear and differ, ''book'' is often lighter than ''regular'', but in some typefaces it is bolder.\n\nBefore the arrival of computers, each weight had to be drawn manually. As a result, many older multi-weight families such as [[Gill Sans]] and [[Monotype Grotesque]] have considerable differences in styles from light to extra-bold. Since the 1980s, it has become increasingly common to use automation to construct a range of weights as points along a trend, [[multiple master fonts|multiple master]] or other parameterized font design. This means that many modern digital fonts such as [[Myriad (typeface)|Myriad]] and [[TheSans]] are offered in a large range of weights which offer a smooth and continuous transition from one weight to the next, although some digital fonts are created with extensive manual corrections.<ref name=\"Phinney MM\">{{cite web|last1=Phinney|first1=Thomas|title=Comments on Quora thread|url=http://www.quora.com/When-creating-type-superfamilies-would-a-type-designer-ever-need-to-manipulate-the-glyphs-of-the-interpolated-auto-generated-weights/answer/Thomas-Phinney?share=1|publisher=Quora|accessdate=11 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nAs digital font design allows more variants to be created faster, an increasingly common development in professional font design is the use of \u201cgrades\u201d: slightly different weights intended for different types of paper and ink, or printing in a different region with different ambient temperature and humidity.<ref name=\"Equity: specimen & manual\">{{cite web|last1=Butterick|first1=Matthew|title=Equity: specimen & manual|url=http://www.mbtype.com/pdf/equity-type-specimen.pdf|publisher=MBType|accessdate=7 August 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Benton Modern\">{{cite web|title=Benton Modern|url=http://bentonmodern.webtype.com/formal/|publisher=Font Bureau|accessdate=7 August 2015}}</ref> For example, a thin design printed on book paper and a thicker design printed on [[coated paper|high-gloss magazine paper]] may come out looking identical, since in the former case the ink will soak and spread out more. Grades are typically offered with characters having the same width on all grades, so that a change of printing materials does not affect copyfit.<ref name=\"Equity review\">{{cite web|last1=Porchez|first1=Jean Fran\u00e7ois|title=Equity review|url=http://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/equity/|website=Typographica|accessdate=13 July 2015}}</ref> Grades are especially common on serif fonts with their finer details.\n\n{{anchor|italic}}\n\n=== {{anchor|Font style}} Slope===\nIn European typefaces, especially Roman ones, a slope or slanted style is used to emphasise important words. This is called [[italic type|''italic'' type]] or [[oblique type]]. These designs normally slant to the right in left-to-right scripts. Oblique styles are often called italic, but differ from 'true italic' styles.\n\nItalic styles are more flowing than the normal typeface, approaching a more [[handwriting|handwritten]], [[cursive]] style, possibly using [[typographic ligature|ligatures]] more commonly or gaining [[swash (typography)|swash]]es. \nAlthough rarely encountered, a typographic face may be accompanied by a matching calligraphic face (''cursive'', ''script''), giving an exaggeratedly italic style.\n\n[[File:Serbian Cyrillic Italic.svg|thumb|[[Cyrillic]] italics]]\nIn many sans-serif and some serif typefaces, especially in those with strokes of even thickness the characters of the italic fonts are only ''slanted'', which is often done algorithmically, without otherwise changing their appearance. Such ''[[oblique type|oblique]]'' fonts are not true italics, because lower-case letter-shapes do not change, but are often marketed as such. Fonts normally do not include both oblique and italic styles: the designer chooses to supply one or the other.\n\nSince italic styles clearly look different to regular (roman) styles, it is possible to have \"upright italic\" designs that take a more cursive form but remain upright; [[Computer Modern]] is an example of a font that offers this style.  In Latin-script countries, upright italics are rare but are sometimes used in mathematics or in complex documents where a section of text already in italics needs a \"double italic\" style to add emphasis to it. For example, the Cyrillic [[Lower case|minuscule]] \"\u0442\" may look like a smaller form of its [[capital letter|majuscule]] \"\u0422\" or more like a roman small \"m\" as in its standard italic appearance; in this case the distinction between styles is also a matter of local preference<!--m-style in South(-East) Europe, the other in Russia-->.\n\nIn Frutiger\u2019s nomenclature the second digit for upright fonts is a 5, for italic fonts a 6 and for condensed italic fonts an 8.\n\nThe two [[Kana|Japanese syllabaries]], [[katakana]] and [[hiragana]], are sometimes seen as two styles or typographic variants of each other, but usually are considered separate character sets as a few of the characters have separate [[kanji]] origins.\nThe [[blackletter|''gothic'' style]] of the roman script with broken letter forms, on the other hand, is usually considered a mere typographic variant.\n\nCursive-only scripts such as [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] also have different styles, in this case for example [[Naskh (script)|Naskh]] and [[Kufic]], although these often depend on application, area or era. <!--There also have been proposals for real(NPOV?) Arabic typefaces without the need for different initial, medial, final and isolated forms or ligatures with even monospaced variants possible. (Source needed)-->\n\nThere are other aspects that can differ among font styles, but more often these are considered immanent features of the typeface. \nThese include the look of digits ([[text figures]]) and the minuscules, which may be smaller versions of the capital letters (''[[small caps]]'') although the script has developed characteristic shapes for them. \nSome typefaces do not include separate glyphs for the cases at all, thereby abolishing the [[letter case|bicamerality]]. While most of these use uppercase characters only, some labeled ''[[unicase]]'' exist which choose either the majuscule or the minuscule glyph at a common height for both characters.\n\n{{anchor|stretch}}\n\n[[File:Avenir Next regular and condensed widths.png|thumb|The typeface Avenir Next in condensed and regular widths.]]\n\n===Width===\n\nSome typefaces include fonts that vary the width of the characters (''stretch''), although this feature is usually rarer than weight or stroke.\n\nNarrower fonts are usually labeled ''compressed'', ''condensed'' or ''narrow''. In Frutiger's system, the second digit of condensed fonts is a 7. \nWider fonts may be called ''wide'', ''extended'' or ''expanded''. \nBoth can be further classified by prepending ''extra'', ''ultra'' or the like.\n\nThese separate fonts have to be distinguished from techniques that alter the [[letter-spacing]] to achieve narrower or smaller words, especially for [[Justification (typesetting)|justified text alignment]].\n[[Image:Mediaevalziffern.svg|thumb|right|[[Hoefler Text]] uses non-lining or text figures as default, providing upper-case or lining figures as an alternative.]]\nMost typefaces either have [[Typeface#Proportion|proportional]] or [[Monospaced font|monospaced]] (i.e. typewriter-style) letter widths, if the script provides the possibility. There are, however, superfamilies covering both styles.\n\nSome fonts provide both [[Typeface#Typesetting numbers|proportional and fixed-width]] (''tabular'') digits, where the former usually coincide with lowercase [[text figures]] and the latter with uppercase [[lining figures]].\n\nThe width of a font will depend on its intended use. [[Times New Roman]] was designed with the goal of having small width, to fit more text into a newspaper. On the other hand, [[Palatino]] has large width to increase readability.\n\n===Optical size===\n[[File:Optical Size Demonstration.png|thumb|Optical sizes in the open-source family [[Garamond#EB Garamond|EB Garamond]]. At top, correct use: ''Green'' is in a slimmer style designed for text printed large, and ''authority'' in a thicker style for text printed small. The bottom pair are the wrong way round: ''Green'' looks too thick and ''authority'' too thin.]]\nSome professional digital typefaces include fonts that are optimised for certain sizes, for instance by using a thinner stroke weight if they are intended to be printed larger, or by using [[ink trap]]s if they are to be printed at small size on poor-quality paper.<ref name=\"How To Choose The Right Face For A Beautiful Body\">{{cite web|last1=Reynolds|first1=Dan|title=How To Choose The Right Face For A Beautiful Body|url=http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/05/how-to-choose-the-right-face-for-a-beautiful-body/|website=Smashing|accessdate=13 September 2015}}</ref> This was a natural feature in the metal type period for most typefaces, since each size would be cut separately and made to its own slightly different design.<ref name=MicroPlus>{{cite web|last1=Frere-Jones|first1=Tobias|title=MicroPlus|url=https://frerejones.com/blog/introducing-microplus|publisher=Frere-Jones Type|accessdate=1 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Requiem features|url=http://www.typography.com/fonts/requiem/features/|publisher=Hoefler & Frere-Jones|accessdate=2 July 2015}}</ref> However, it declined in use as the [[pantograph]], phototypesetting and digital fonts made printing the same font at any size simpler; a revival has taken place in recent years as the range of competition in the font market has increased.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ahrens and Mugikura|title=Size-specific Adjustments to Type Designs|url=http://justanotherfoundry.com/size-specific-adjustments-to-type-designs|publisher=Just Another Foundry|accessdate=21 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Coles|first1=Stephen|title=Book Review: Size-specific Adjustments to Type Designs|url=http://typographica.org/typography-books/size-specific-adjustments-to-type-designs/|website=Typographica|accessdate=21 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Kupferschmid|first1=Indra|title=Multi-axes type families|url=http://kupferschrift.de/cms/2012/05/multi-axes-families/|website=kupferschrift|accessdate=8 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Trianon|url=https://www.productiontype.com/collection/trianon_collection|publisher=Production Type|accessdate=2 July 2015}}</ref> Optical sizes are particularly common for serif fonts, since their finer detail will particularly need to be bulked up for smaller sizes and made less overpowering at larger ones.<ref name=MicroPlus />\n\nThere are several naming schemes for such variant designs.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Slimbach, Souser, Slye, Twardoch|title=Arno Pro specimen|url=http://wwwimages.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/products/type/pdfs/ArnoPro.pdf|publisher=Adobe|accessdate=3 July 2015}}</ref> One such scheme, invented and popularized by [[Adobe Systems]], refers to the variant fonts by the applications they are typically used for, with the exact point sizes intended varying slightly by typeface:\n; Poster: extremely large sizes, usually larger than 72 point\n; Display: large sizes, typically 19\u201372 point\n; Subhead: large text, typically about 14\u201318 point\n; (Regular): usually left unnamed, typically about 10\u201313 point\n; Small Text (''SmText''): typically about 8\u201310 point\n; Caption: very small, typically about 6\u20138 point\n[[Image:Kerning EN.svg|thumb|Kerning brings A and V closer with their serifs over each other]]\n\n===Metrics===\n[[Typeface#Font metrics|''Font metrics'']] refers to [[metadata]] consisting of numeric values relating to size and space in the font overall, or in its individual glyphs. Font-wide metrics include [[cap height]] (the height of the capitals), [[x-height]] (the height of the lower-case letters) and [[Ascender (typography)|ascender]] height, [[descender]] depth, and the font [[bounding box]]. Glyph-level metrics include the glyph bounding box, the advance width (the proper distance between the glyph's initial pen position and the next glyph's initial pen position), and sidebearings (space that pads the glyph outline on either side). Many digital (and some metal type) fonts are able to be [[Kerning|kerned]] so that characters can be fitted more closely; the pair 'Wa' is a common example of this.\n\nSome fonts, especially those intended for professional use, are duplexed: made with multiple weights having the same character width so that (for example) changing from regular to bold or italic does not affect word wrap.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Butterick|first1=Matthew|title=Concourse specimen pdf|url=http://typo.la/cots|publisher=MBType|accessdate=7 August 2015}}</ref> [[Sabon]] as originally designed was a notable example of this.\n\nEarly fonts used in digital printing were often very expensive, and featured extremely tight licensing restrictions; in particular, a basic set of fonts used by Apple and Adobe in the [[PostScript]] printing system rapidly became a standard in printing. To avoid paying licensing fees for this set or other fonts, many computer companies commissioned \"metrically-compatible\" clone fonts with the same spacing, which could be used to display the same document without it seeming clearly different. [[Arial]] and [[Century Gothic]] are notable examples of this, being almost indistinguishable from the PostScript standard fonts [[Helvetica]] and [[ITC Avant Garde]] respectively.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shaw|first1=Paul|title=Arial Addendum no. 3|url=http://www.paulshawletterdesign.com/2011/10/blue-pencil-no-18%E2%80%94arial-addendum-no-3/|website=Blue Pencil|accessdate=1 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Shaw (& Nicholas)|title=Arial addendum no. 4|url=http://www.paulshawletterdesign.com/2011/11/blue-pencil-no-18%E2%80%94arial-addendum-no-4/|website=Blue Pencil|accessdate=1 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=McDonald|first1=Rob|title=Some history about Arial|url=http://www.paulshawletterdesign.com/2011/09/blue-pencil-no-18%E2%80%94some-history-about-arial/|website=Paul Shaw Letter Design|accessdate=22 May 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"arial_dead\">{{cite journal|magazine=Step Inside Design |last=Haley |first=Allan |url=http://www.stepinsidedesign.com/STEP/Article/28763/ |title=Is Arial Dead Yet? |date=May\u2013June 2007 |accessdate=2011-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719133850/http://www.stepinsidedesign.com/STEP/Article/28763/ |archivedate=July 19, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Monotype Imaging|url=http://www.monotypeimaging.com/ProductsServices/TypeDesignerShowcase/RobinNicholas/Samples.aspx?type=samp3|title=Type Designer Showcase: Robin Nicholas \u2013 Arial|accessdate=2011-05-10}}</ref> Some of these were created in order to be freely redistributable, for example Google's open-source [[Croscore fonts]] and [[Red Hat]]'s [[Liberation fonts]] duplicating common fonts used in [[Microsoft]] software.<ref name=\"home\">{{Citation | url = https://fedorahosted.org/liberation-fonts/ | title = Liberation Fonts | publisher = Fedora}}</ref> It is not a requirement that the design be exactly the same.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Schwartz|first1=Christian|title=DB|url=http://www.christianschwartz.com/db.shtml|website=Schwartzco|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref>\n{{multiple image\n| image1 = Typeface-thesis.jpg\n| caption1 = Serifs within the [[Thesis (typeface)|Thesis]] typeface family\n| width1 = 180\n| image2 = Regular italic swash cap.png\n| caption2 = Italic capital swashes in the typeface [[Minion (typeface)|Minion]]\n| width2 = 143\n}}\n\n===Serifs===\nAlthough most typefaces are characterised by their use of [[serif]]s, there are [[font superfamily|superfamilies]] that incorporate serif (antiqua) and [[sans-serif]] (grotesque) or even intermediate [[slab serif]] (Egyptian) or semi-serif fonts with the same base outlines.\n\nA more common font variant, especially of serif typefaces, is that of alternate capitals.

Single-story characters are more commonly found as default in [[Sans-serif#geometric|geometric]] [[sans-serif]] fonts such as [[Century Gothic]], shown at bottom.]]\nTypefaces may be made in variants for different uses. These may be issued as separate font files, or the different characters may be included in the same font file if the font is a modern format such as [[OpenType]] and the application used can support this.<ref name=\"What's OpenType?\">{{cite web|title=What's OpenType?|url=http://www.typography.com/techniques/opentype/|publisher=Hoefler & Frere-Jones|accessdate=7 August 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Why a better OpenType UI matters\">{{cite web|last1=Peters|first1=Yves|title=Why a better OpenType UI matters|url=http://ilovetypography.com/2014/10/25/why-a-better-opentype-user-interface-matters/|website=i love typography|accessdate=14 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nAlternative characters are often called stylistic alternates. These may be switched on to allow users more flexibility to customise the font to suit their needs. The practice is not new: in the 1930s, [[Gill Sans]], a British design, was sold abroad with alternative characters to make it resemble fonts such as [[Futura (typeface)|Futura]] popular in other countries, while [[Bembo]] from the same period has two styles of 'R': one with a stretched-out leg for widely spaced [[all caps]] text, one that blends better into body text.<ref>{{cite web|title=Specimen Book of Monotype Printing Types (photograph)|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/bogtrykkeren/5331070318|website=Flickr|accessdate=3 May 2015}}</ref> With modern digital fonts, it is possible to group related alternative characters into stylistic sets, which may be turned on and off together. For example, in [[Caslon#Williams Caslon Text|Williams Caslon Text]], a revival of the 18th century font [[Caslon]], the default italic forms have many swashes matching the original design. For a more spare appearance, these can all be turned off at once by engaging stylistic set 4.<ref name=\"Williams Caslon Text features manual\">{{cite web|last1=Berkson|first1=William|title=Williams Caslon Text features manual|url=http://www.fontbureau.com/media/pdf/WilliamsCaslonText-Features.pdf|publisher=Font Bureau|accessdate=7 August 2015}}</ref> [[Junicode]], intended for academic publishing, uses ss15 to enable a [[E caudata|variant form of 'e']] used in medieval Latin.

They may also include separate styles for superscript and subscript digits. Professional fonts may include even more complex settings for typesetting numerals, such as numerals intended to match the height of [[small caps]].<ref name=\"Shinntype Modern Suite specification\">{{cite web|last1=Shinn|first1=Nick|title=Shinntype Modern Suite specification|url=http://shinntype.com/wp-content/uploads/files/pdf/Scotch_Modern.pdf|publisher=Shinntype|accessdate=16 October 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Paciencias specification\">{{cite web|title=Paciencias specification|url=http://www.typographias.com/|publisher=Typographias|accessdate=16 October 2015}}</ref> In addition, some fonts such as Adobe\u2019s Acumin and [[Christian Schwartz]]\u2019s [[Helvetica#Neue Haas Grotesk (2010)|Neue Haas Grotesk]] digitisation offer two heights of lining (upper-case height) figures: one slightly lower than cap height, intended to blend better into continuous text, and one at exactly the cap height to look better in combination with capitals for uses such as UK postcodes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Neue Haas Grotesk|url=http://www.fontbureau.com/nhg/|publisher=The Font Bureau, Inc.|page=Introduction}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linotype.com/6598/neuehaasgrotesk.html |title=Neue Haas Grotesk - Font News |publisher=Linotype.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christianschwartz.com/haasgrotesk.shtml |title=Schwartzco Inc |publisher=Christianschwartz.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-21}}</ref><ref name=\"Acumin - usage\">{{cite web|last1=Slimbach|first1=Robert|title=Acumin - usage|url=http://acumin.typekit.com/usage/|website=Typekit|publisher=[[Adobe Systems]]|accessdate=16 October 2015}}</ref> With the OpenType format, it is possible to bundle all these into a single digital font file, but earlier font releases may have only one type per file.\n\n==Subsetting==\nA typical font may contain hundreds or even thousands of glyphs, often representing characters from many different languages. Oftentimes, users may only need a small subset of the glyphs that are available to them. Subsetting is the process of removing unnecessary glyphs from a font file, usually with the goal of reducing file size. This is particularly important for web fonts, since reducing file size often means reducing page load time and server load. Alternatively, fonts may be issued in different files for different regions of the world, though with the spread of the OpenType format this is now increasingly uncommon.\n== See also ==\n* [[Ampersand]]\n* [[Clip font]]\n* [[Font embedding]]\n* [[Graphics|Graphic]]\n* [[List of fonts]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n*Blackwell, Lewis.
