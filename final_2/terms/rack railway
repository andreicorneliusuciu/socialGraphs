The [[train]]s are fitted with one or more [[gear|cog wheels]] or [[pinion]]s that mesh with this [[rack and pinion|rack rail]]. This allows the trains to operate on steep grades above around 7 to 10%, which is the maximum for [[Adhesion railway|friction-based rail]]. Most rack railways are [[mountain railway]]s, although a few are [[Rapid transit|transit railways]] or [[tram]]ways built to overcome a steep [[Grade (slope)|gradient]] in an [[Urban area|urban]] environment.\n\nThe first cog railway was the [[Middleton Railway]] between [[Middleton, West Yorkshire|Middleton]] and [[Leeds]] in [[West Yorkshire]], England, [[UK]], where the first commercially successful [[steam locomotive]], ''[[The Salamanca|Salamanca]]'', ran in 1812. This used a [[rack and pinion]] system designed and patented in 1811 by [[John Blenkinsop]].<ref name=Jehan>{{cite book |title=Rack Railways of Australia |last=Jehan |first=David |publisher=Illawarra Light Railway Museum Society |year=2003 |edition=2nd. |isbn=0-9750452-0-2}}</ref>\n\nThe first mountain cog railway was the [[Mount Washington Cog Railway]] in the [[United States|US]] state of [[New Hampshire]], which carried its first fare-paying passengers in 1868. The track was completed to reach the summit of [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]] in 1869. The first mountain rack railway in [[continental Europe]] was the [[Vitznau-Rigi-Bahn]] on [[Rigi|Mount Rigi]] in [[Switzerland]], which opened in 1871. Both lines are still running.\n\n== Rack systems ==\n[[File:Rack railway.jpg|thumb|Different rack systems: from the left, <br> [[Rack railway#Riggenbach|Riggenbach]], [[Rack railway#Strub|Strub]], [[Rack railway#Abt|Abt]] and [[Rack railway#Locher|Locher]].]]\nA number of different rack systems have been developed.

Blenkinsop's system remained in use for 25 years on the [[Middleton Railway]], but it became a curiosity because simple friction was found to be sufficient for railroads operating on level ground.<ref name=Abt1910>Roman Abt, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6pIEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA525 Mountain and Rack Railways] [[Cassier's Magazine]], Vol. XXXVII, No. 5 (March 1910); page 525.</ref>\n\nRack systems place the rack rail halfway between the running rails, with the exception of some early [[Rack railway#Morgan|Morgan rack]] installations.\n\n=== Marsh ===\n[[File:New England Fall Color Tour Oct. 2012 187.JPG|thumb|left|The Marsh rack and pinion system, Located in the museum.]]\nThe first successful rack railway in the US was the [[Mount Washington Cog Railway]], developed by [[Sylvester Marsh]].<ref>[http://www.cog-railway.com/smarsh.htm Sylvester Marsh]</ref>  Marsh was issued a U.S. [[patent]] for the general idea of a rack railway in September 1861,<ref name=Marsh1861>Sylvester Marsh, Improvement in Locomotive-Engines for Ascending Inclined Planes, [http://www.google.com/patents?id=M1RtAAAAEBAJ U.S. Patent 33,255], September 10, 1861.</ref> and in January 1867 for a practical rack where the gear teeth take the form of rollers arranged like the rungs of a ladder between two L-shaped wrought-iron rails.<ref>Sylvester Marsh, Improved Cog-Rail for Railroads, [http://www.google.com/patents?id=JHAAAAAAEBAJ U.S. Patent 61,221], January 15, 1867.</ref>  The first public trial of the Marsh rack on Mount Washington was made on August 29, 1866, when only one quarter of a mile (402 meters) of track had been completed.  The Mount Washington railway opened to the public on August 14, 1868.<ref>C. H. Hitchcock, Chapter IV: The Approaches to Mount Washington, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aLmHk2fFfbQC&pg=PA82 Mount Washington in Winter], Chick and Andrews, Boston, 1871; page 82-85.</ref>  The pinion wheels on the locomotives have deep teeth that ensure that at least two teeth are engaged with the rack at all times; this measure helps reduce the possibility of the pinions riding up and out of the rack.<ref name=Jehan/>\n\n=== Riggenbach ===\n[[File:Zahnradbahn riggenbach.jpg|upright|thumb|right|The Riggenbach rack system]]\nThe Riggenbach rack system was invented by [[Niklaus Riggenbach]] working at about the same time as, but independently from Marsh. Riggenbach was granted a French patent in 1863 based on a working model which he used to interest potential Swiss backers. During this time, the Swiss Consul to the United States visited Marsh's Mount Washington Cog Railway and reported back with enthusiasm to the Swiss government. Eager to boost tourism in Switzerland, the government commissioned Riggenbach to build a rack railway up [[Rigi Mountain]]. Following the construction of a prototype locomotive and test track in a quarry near [[Bern]], the [[Vitznau-Rigi-Bahn]] opened on 22 May 1871.<ref name=Jehan/>\n\nThe Riggenbach system is similar in design to the Marsh system. It uses a ladder rack, formed of [[Structural steel#Common structural shapes|steel plates]] or channels connected by round or square rods at regular intervals. The Riggenbach system suffers from the problem that its fixed [[ladder rack]] is more complex and expensive to build than the other systems.\n\nFollowing the success of the Vitznau-Rigi-Bahn, Riggenbach established the ''Maschinenfabrik der Internationalen Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Bergbahnen'' (IGB) - a company that produced rack locomotives to his design.<ref name=Jehan/>\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Strub ===\n[[File:Zahnradbahn strub.jpg|upright|thumb|right|The Strub rack system]]\nThe Strub rack system was invented by [[Emil Strub]] in 1896. It uses a rolled flat-bottom [[Rail tracks#Rail|rail]] with rack teeth machined into the head approximately 100&nbsp;mm apart. Safety jaws fitted to the locomotive engage with the underside of the head to prevent derailments and serve as a brake.<ref name=Jehan/>  Strub's US Patent, granted in 1898, also includes details of how the rack rail is integrated with the mechanism of a [[Turnout (rail)|turnout]].<ref name=Strub1898>Emil Strub, Rack-Rail for Mountain-Railways, [http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=8ulMAAAAEBAJ U.S. Patent 600,324], March 8, 1898.</ref>\n\nThe best-known use of the Strub system is on the [[Jungfraubahn]] in Switzerland.<ref name=Jehan/> It is the simplest rack system to maintain and has become increasingly popular.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Morgan ===\n[[File:MorganRack.jpg|thumb|right|The non-powered variant of the Morgan rack, from the 1919 Goodman catalog.]]\n[[File:Mammoth Vein Coal Fig 8.jpg|thumb|right|A rack-powered Goodman locomotive on a 16% grade in a coal mine near [[Marysville, Iowa#Everist|Everist, Iowa]].]]\nIn 1900, E.

Abt worked for Riggenbach at his works in [[Olten]] and later at his IGB rack locomotive company. In 1885, he founded his own civil engineering company.<ref name=Jehan/>\n\nDuring the early 1880s, Abt worked to devise an improved rack system that overcame the limitations of the Riggenbach system. In particular, the Riggenbach rack was expensive to manufacture and maintain and the [[Railroad switch|switches]] were complex. In 1882, Abt designed a new rack using solid bars with vertical teeth machined into them. Two or three of these bars are mounted centrally between the rails, with the teeth offset.<ref>Roman Abt, Permanent Way for Mountain Railways, [http://www.google.com/patents?id=ik1QAAAAEBAJ U.S. Patent 284,790], September 11, 1883</ref> The use of multiple bars with offset teeth ensures that the pinions on the locomotive driving wheels are constantly engaged with the rack.<ref>Roman Abt, Locomotive, [http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=bjBJAAAAEBAJ U.S. Patent 339,831], April 13, 1886.</ref> The Abt system is cheaper to build than the Riggenbach because it requires a lower weight of rack over a given length. However the Riggenbach system exhibits greater wear resistance than the Abt.<ref name=Jehan/>\n\nAbt also developed a system for smoothing the transition from friction to rack traction, using a spring-mounted rack section to bring the pinion teeth gradually into engagement.<ref>Roman Abt, Rack-Rail for Railways, [http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=oZlbAAAAEBAJ U.S. Patent 349,624], September 21, 1886.</ref>[[File:Abt traction transition.JPG|thumb|left|Traction transition section]]\n\nThe first use of the Abt system was on the [[Harz Narrow Gauge Railways|Harzbahn]] in Germany which opened in 1885.<ref name=Jehan/>\n\nThe pinion wheels can be mounted on the same axle as the rail wheels (as in the picture at left), or driven separately.  The steam locomotives on the [[Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company]] had separate cylinders driving the pinion wheel, as do the [['X' Class locomotives (Nilgiri Mountain Railway)|'X' Class locomotives]] on the [[Nilgiri Mountain Railway]].\n\n* The steepest gradient on the rack section of [[Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company]] was 1 in 15 (6.67%),<ref>http://www.queenstowntasmania.com/Railway_Past_And_Future_Page.php</ref>\n* The steepest gradient on the rack section of the [[Mount Morgan railway station|Mount Morgan Railway]] was 1 in 16.5 (6,06%).<ref>http://www.mountmorgan.org.au/history/the-mount-morgan-railway</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Locher ===\n[[File:LocherRackSystem.jpg|thumb|right|Locher rack system]]\n[[File:Pilatus Rack.jpg|thumb|Locher Rack system (seen from above)]]\nThe Locher rack system, invented by [[Eduard Locher]], has [[gear]] teeth cut in the sides rather than the top of the rail, engaged by two cog wheels on the locomotive.  This system allows use on steeper grades than the other systems, whose teeth could jump out of the rack.  It is used on the [[Pilatus Railway]].\n\nLocher set out to design a rack system that could be used on gradients as steep as 1 in 2 (50%). The Abt system - the most common rack system in [[Switzerland]] at the time - was limited to a maximum gradient of 1 in 4 (25%). Locher showed that on steeper grade, the Abt system was prone to the driving pinion over-riding the rack, causing potentially catastrophic derailments, as predicted by Dr. Abt.\nTo overcome this problem and allow a rack line up the steep sides of [[Pilatus (mountain)|Mt. Pilatus]], Locher developed a rack system where the rack is a flat bar with symmetrical, horizontal teeth. Horizontal pinions engage the centrally-mounted bar, both driving the locomotive and keeping it centered on the track.\n\nThis system provides very stable attachment to the track, also protecting the car from toppling over even under the most severe crosswinds. Such gears are also capable of leading the car, so even flanges on running wheels are optional. The biggest shortcoming of the system is that the standard [[railway switch]] is not usable, and a [[transfer table]] or other complex device must be used where branching of the track is needed.\n\nFollowing tests, the Locher system was deployed on the Pilatus Railway, which opened in 1889. No other public railway uses the Locher system, although some European coal mines use a similar system on steeply graded underground lines.<ref name=Jehan />\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Lamella ===\n[[File:Riggenbach-Strub.jpg|thumb|Joint between Riggenbach and Lamella]]\n[[File:Cr\u00e9maill\u00e8re - Panoramique des D\u00f4mes.jpg|thumb|left|Rack railway track using the Strub system rack.]]\nThe Lamella system (also known as the Von Roll system) was developed by the [[Von Roll company]] after the rolled steel rails used in the Strub system became unavailable. It is formed from a single blade cut in a similar fashion to the Abt system but typically wider than a single Abt bar. The Lamella rack can be used by locomotives designed for use on the Riggenbach or the Strub systems, so long as the safety-jaws that were a feature of the original Strub system are not used.  Some railways use rack from multiple systems; for example, the [[Appenzeller Bahnen|St. Gallen Gais Appenzell Railway]] in Switzerland has sections of Riggenbach, Strub and Lamella rack.<ref name=Jehan />\n\nMost of the rack railways built from the late 20th century onwards have used the Lamella system.<ref name=Jehan/>\n\n=== Rack-and-adhesion systems / Pure rack systems ===\nRack-and-adhesion systems use the cog drive only on the steepest sections and elsewhere operate as a regular railway.  Others, the steeper ones, are rack-only.  On the latter type, the locomotives' wheels are generally free-wheeling and despite appearances do not contribute to driving the train. In this case the racks continue also in the horizontal parts, if any.\n\n=== Fell ===\n{{main|Fell mountain railway system}}\nThe Fell mountain railway system is not strictly speaking a rack railway since there are no cogs with teeth.  Rather, this system uses a smooth raised centre rail between the two running rails on steep lines which is gripped on both sides to improve friction.  Trains are propelled by wheels or braked by shoes pressed horizontally onto the centre rail, as well as by means of the normal running wheels.\n\n== Switches ==\n[[File:Rack railway turnout (SPB).JPG|thumb|right|Railroad switch on a rack railway.  The turnout itself uses Lamella rack rails, but the design is one originally pioneered by Strub.  The track outside the turnout uses Riggenbach rack rails. ([[Schynige Platte Railway]], [[Switzerland]])]]\n[[File:Mount Washington Cog Railway Operators 2000.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Mount Washington Cog Railway Operators, 2000]]\n[[File:A switch of Mount Washington Cog Railway.jpg|thumb|left|300px|An automatic hydraulic turnout of Mount Washington Cog Railway]]\n\nRack railway switches are as varied as rack railway technologies, for optional rack lines such as the [[Zentralbahn]] in [[Switzerland]] and the [[West Coast Wilderness Railway]] in [[Tasmania]] it is convenient to only use switches on sections flat enough for adhesion (for example, on a pass summit).  Other systems which rely on the rack for driving (with the conventional rail wheels undriven) such as the [[Dolderbahn]] in [[Zurich]], [[\u0160trbsk\u00e9 Pleso]] in [[Slovakia]] and the [[Schynige Platte Railway|Schynige Platte rack railway]] instead must switch the rack rail.  The Dolderbahn switch works by bending all three rails, an operation that is performed every trip as the two trains pass in the middle.\n\nThe [[Track geometry|geometry]] of the rack system has a large impact on the construction of turnouts.  If the rack is elevated above the running rails, there is no need to interrupt the running rails to allow passage of the driving pinions of the engines.  Strub explicitly documented this in his U.S. patent.<ref name=Strub1898 />  Strub used a complex set of bell-cranks and push-rods linking the throw-rod for the [[Railroad switch#Points (point blades)|points]] to the two throw-rods for the moving rack sections.  One break in the rack was required to select between the two routes, and a second break was required where the rack rails cross the running rails.  Turnouts for the Morgan Rack system were similar, with the rack elevated above the running rails.  Most of the Morgan turnout patents included movable rack sections to avoid breaks in the rack,<ref name=Morgan1904a /><ref name=Morgan1904b /> but because all Morgan locomotives had two linked drive pinions, there was no need for a continuous rack.  So long as the breaks in the rack were shorter than the distance between the drive pinions on the locomotive, the rack rail could be interrupted wherever there was need to cross over a running rail.<ref name=Morgan1900 />\n\nTurnouts are far more complex when the rack is at or below the level of the running rails.  Marsh's first rack patent shows such an arrangement,<ref name=Marsh1861 /> and the original [[Mount Washington Cog Railway]] he built had no turnouts.  It was not until 1941 that a turnout was constructed on this line.<ref>[http://www.cog-railway.com/timeline.htm Mount Washington Railway Company Historical Timeline]</ref>  There were more turnouts built for the line but all were hand operated. In 2003, a new automatic hydraulic turnout was developed and built at the base as a prototype. With the success of the new turnout, more new automatic hydraulic turnouts were built to replace the hand-operated ones. The new turnouts installed on the Mount Washington line in 2007 are essentially [[transfer table]]s.<ref>{{cite news|title=New Switching System Installed|url=http://thecog.com/media.php?article=new_switch|accessdate=14 July 2014|work=Cog Railway Media Resources|publisher=Mount Washington Cog Railway}}</ref> The Locher rack also requires transfer tables.\n\n== Cog locomotives ==\n\n[[File:Rigi vertical boiler.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Vertical boiler locomotive of the [[Rigi Railways|Arth\u2013Rigi Railway]].]]\n[[File:Mount Washington Cog Railway 2 035.jpg|thumb|left|200px|\"Old Peppersass\" of the Mt. Washington Cog Railway, USA.]]\n[[File:Cog railway Schneeberg.jpeg|thumb|[[Schneeberg Railway (cog railway)|Schneeberg cog railway]] steam locomotive, with tilted boiler, on level track.]]\n[[File:Ferrovia Renon.jpg|right|thumb|[[Rittnerbahn]] early electric cog locomotive and carriage]]\nOriginally almost all [[gear|cog]] railways were powered by [[steam locomotive]]s.  The steam locomotive needs to be extensively modified to work effectively in this environment.  Unlike a [[diesel locomotive]] or [[electric locomotive]], the steam locomotive only works when its powerplant (the boiler, in this case) is fairly level.  The locomotive boiler requires water to cover the [[Fire-tube boiler|boiler tubes]] and [[Firebox (steam engine)|firebox]] sheets at all times, particularly the [[crown sheet]], the metal top of the firebox.  If this is not covered with water, the heat of the fire will soften it enough to give way under the boiler pressure, leading to a catastrophic failure.\n\nOn rack systems with extreme gradients, the boiler, cab and general superstructure of the locomotive are tilted forward relative to the wheels so that they are more or less horizontal when on the steeply graded track.  These locomotives often cannot function on level track, and so the entire line, including maintenance shops, must be laid on a gradient. This is one of the reasons why [[rack and pinion|rack]] railways were among the first to be electrified and most of today's rack railways are electrically powered. In some cases, the [[vertical boiler]] can be used that is less sensitive for the track gradient.\n\nOn a rack-only railroad, locomotives are always downward of their [[passenger car (rail)|passenger car]]s for safety reasons: the locomotive is fitted with powerful brakes, often including hooks or clamps that grip the rack rail solidly.  Some locomotives are fitted with automatic brakes that apply if the speed gets too high, preventing runaways.  Often there is no coupler between locomotive and train since gravity will always push the passenger car down against the locomotive.  Electrically powered vehicles often have electromagnetic track brakes as well.\n\nThe maximum speed of trains operating on a cog railway is very low, generally from 9 to 25&nbsp;km/h (6 to 16&nbsp;mph) depending on gradient and propulsion method.  Because the [[Skitube]] has gentler gradients than typical, its speeds are higher than typical.\n\n== List of cog and rack railways ==\n{{See also|list of mountain railways}}\n{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}\n\n=== Angola ===\n\n* Lengue gorge.<ref>http://trains-worldexpresses.com/700/705.htm</ref>\n* on [[Benguela railway]] - 1906<ref>http://www.railpage.com.au/f-t11357768-s75.htm</ref>\n\n=== Argentina ===\n* [[Transandine Railway]] between [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]] and [[Los Andes, Chile|Santa Rosa de Los Andes, Chile]], see [[Chile]] below.\n\n=== Australia ===\n* [[West Coast Wilderness Railway]] in [[Tasmania]], originally opened in 1896 to service the [[Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company|Mount Lyell]] copper mine and closed and completely removed in 1960s.
