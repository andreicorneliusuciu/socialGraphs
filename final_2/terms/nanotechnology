A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the [[National Nanotechnology Initiative]], which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 [[nanometers]]. This definition reflects the fact that [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] effects are important at this [[quantum realm|quantum-realm]] scale, and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter which occur below the given size threshold. It is therefore common to see the plural form \"nanotechnologies\" as well as \"nanoscale technologies\" to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size. Because of the variety of potential applications (including industrial and military), governments have invested billions of dollars in nanotechnology research. Until 2012, through its National Nanotechnology Initiative, the USA has invested 3.7 billion dollars, the European Union has invested 1.2 billion and Japan 750 million dollars.<ref>[http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=230436 Apply nanotech to up industrial, agri output], [[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|''The Daily Star'' (Bangladesh)]], 17 April 2012.</ref>\n\nNanotechnology as defined by size is naturally very broad, including fields of science as diverse as [[surface science]], [[organic chemistry]], [[molecular biology]], [[semiconductor physics]], [[microfabrication]], [[molecular engineering]], etc.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Saini|first=Rajiv |author2=Saini, Santosh |author3=Sharma, Sugandha|title=Nanotechnology: The Future Medicine|journal=Journal of Cutaneous and Aesthetic Surgery|year=2010|volume=3|issue=1|pages=32\u201333|doi=10.4103/0974-2077.63301|pmc=2890134|pmid=20606992}}</ref>  The associated research and applications are equally diverse, ranging from extensions of conventional [[Semiconductor device|device physics]] to completely new approaches based upon [[molecular self-assembly]], from developing [[Nanomaterial|new materials]] with dimensions on the nanoscale to [[Molecular nanotechnology|direct control of matter on the atomic scale]].\n\nScientists currently debate the future [[implications of nanotechnology]]. Nanotechnology may be able to create many new materials and devices with a vast range of [[List of nanotechnology applications|applications]], such as in [[nanomedicine]], [[nanoelectronics]], [[biomaterial]]s energy production, and consumer products. On the other hand, nanotechnology raises many of the same issues as any new technology, including concerns about the [[Nanotoxicology|toxicity]] and environmental impact of nanomaterials,<ref>{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Buzea | first1 = C. \n| last2 = Pacheco | first2 = I.

These concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special [[regulation of nanotechnology]] is warranted.\n\n==Origins==\n{{Main article|History of nanotechnology}}\nThe concepts that seeded nanotechnology were first discussed in 1959 by renowned physicist [[Richard Feynman]] in his talk ''[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]]'', in which he described the possibility of synthesis via direct manipulation of atoms. The term \"nano-technology\" was first used by [[Norio Taniguchi]] in 1974, though it was not widely known.\n\n[[File:Comparison of nanomaterials sizes.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Comparison of Nanomaterials Sizes]]\n\nInspired by Feynman's concepts, [[K. Eric Drexler]] used the term \"nanotechnology\" in his 1986 book ''[[Engines of creation|Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology]]'', which proposed the idea of a nanoscale \"assembler\" which would be able to build a copy of itself and of other items of arbitrary complexity with atomic control. Also in 1986, Drexler co-founded [[The Foresight Institute]] (with which he is no longer affiliated) to help increase public awareness and understanding of nanotechnology concepts and implications.\n\nThus, emergence of nanotechnology as a field in the 1980s occurred through convergence of Drexler's theoretical and public work, which developed and popularized a conceptual framework for nanotechnology, and high-visibility experimental advances that drew additional wide-scale attention to the prospects of atomic control of matter. In the 1980s, two major breakthroughs sparked the growth of nanotechnology in modern era.\n\nFirst, the invention of the [[scanning tunneling microscope]] in 1981 which provided unprecedented visualization of individual atoms and bonds, and was successfully used to manipulate individual atoms in 1989. The microscope's developers [[Gerd Binnig]] and [[Heinrich Rohrer]] at [[IBM Zurich Research Laboratory]] received a [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1986.<ref name=\"Binnig\">{{Cite journal|first1=G. |last1=Binnig |first2=H. |last2=Rohrer|title=Scanning tunneling microscopy|journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development|volume=30|issue=4|year=1986|pages=355\u201369}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Press Release: the 1986 Nobel Prize in Physics|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1986/press.html|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=12 May 2011|date=15 October 1986}}</ref> Binnig, [[Calvin F.

Controversies emerged regarding the definitions and potential implications of nanotechnologies, exemplified by the [[Royal Society]]'s report on nanotechnology.<ref name=\"royalsociety\">{{cite web |publisher=Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering |title=Nanoscience and nanotechnologies: opportunities and uncertainties |date=July 2004 |url=http://www.nanotec.org.uk/finalReport.htm |accessdate=13 May 2011}}</ref> Challenges were raised regarding the feasibility of applications envisioned by advocates of molecular nanotechnology, which culminated in a public debate between Drexler and Smalley in 2001 and 2003.<ref name=\"counterpoint\">{{cite journal |url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/8148/8148counterpoint.html |title=Nanotechnology: Drexler and Smalley make the case for and against 'molecular assemblers' |journal=Chemical & Engineering News |volume=81 |issue=48 |pages=37\u201342 |publisher=American Chemical Society |date=1 December 2003 |accessdate=9 May 2010 |doi=10.1021/cen-v081n036.p037}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, commercialization of products based on advancements in nanoscale technologies began emerging. These products are limited to bulk applications of [[nanomaterials]] and do not involve atomic control of matter. Some examples include the [[Silver Nano]] platform for using [[silver nanoparticles]] as an antibacterial agent, [[nanoparticle]]-based transparent sunscreens, [[Carbon fibers|carbon fiber]] strengthening using silica nanoparticles, and carbon nanotubes for stain-resistant textiles.<ref name=\"americanelements\">{{cite web|title=Nanotechnology Information Center: Properties, Applications, Research, and Safety Guidelines|url=http://www.americanelements.com/nanotech.htm|publisher=[[American Elements]]|accessdate=13 May 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"emergingnano\">{{cite web |year=2008 |url=http://www.nanotechproject.org/inventories/consumer/analysis_draft/ |publisher=The Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies |title=Analysis: This is the first publicly available on-line inventory of nanotechnology-based consumer products |accessdate=13 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nGovernments moved to promote and [[Funding of science|fund research]] into nanotechnology, such as in the U.S. with the [[National Nanotechnology Initiative]], which formalized a size-based definition of nanotechnology and established funding for research on the nanoscale, and in Europe via the European [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development]].\n\nBy the mid-2000s new and serious scientific attention began to flourish.  Projects emerged to produce nanotechnology roadmaps<ref name=PNRoadmap>{{cite web|title=Productive Nanosystems Technology Roadmap|url=http://www.productivenanosystems.com/docs/Nanotech_Roadmap_2007_main.pdf}}</ref><ref name=NASAroadmap>{{cite web|title=NASA Draft Nanotechnology Roadmap|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/501325main_TA10-Nanotech-DRAFT-Nov2010-A.pdf}}</ref>  which center on atomically precise manipulation of matter and discuss existing and projected capabilities, goals, and applications.\n\n==Fundamental concepts==\nNanotechnology is the engineering of functional systems at the molecular scale. This covers both current work and concepts that are more advanced. In its original sense, nanotechnology refers to the projected ability to construct items from the bottom up, using techniques and tools being developed today to make complete, high performance products.\n\nOne [[nanometer]] (nm) is one billionth, or 10<sup>\u22129</sup>, of a meter. By comparison, typical carbon-carbon [[bond length]]s, or the spacing between these [[atom]]s in a [[molecule]], are in the range {{nowrap|0.12\u20130.15 nm}}, and a [[DNA]] double-helix has a diameter around 2&nbsp;nm. On the other hand, the smallest [[cell (biology)|cellular]] life-forms, the bacteria of the genus [[Mycoplasma]], are around 200&nbsp;nm in length. By convention, nanotechnology is taken as the scale range {{nowrap|1 to 100 nm}} following the definition used by the National Nanotechnology Initiative in the US. The lower limit is set by the size of atoms (hydrogen has the smallest atoms, which are approximately a quarter of a nm diameter) since nanotechnology must build its devices from atoms and molecules. The upper limit is more or less arbitrary but is around the size below which  phenomena not observed in larger structures start to become apparent and can be made use of in the nano device.<ref>{{cite book |first=Fritz |last=Allhoff |first2=Patrick |last2=Lin |first3=Daniel |last3=Moore |title=What is nanotechnology and why does it matter?: from science to ethics |pages=3\u20135 |location= |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=2010 |isbn=1-4051-7545-1 }}</ref> These new phenomena make nanotechnology distinct from devices which are merely miniaturised versions of an equivalent [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] device; such devices are on a larger scale and come under the description of [[microtechnology]].<ref>{{cite book |first=S.

In the \"bottom-up\" approach, materials and devices are built from molecular components which [[self-assembly|assemble themselves]] chemically by principles of [[molecular recognition]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|last1=Kralj|first1=Slavko|last2=Makovec|first2=Darko|title=Magnetic Assembly of Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticle Clusters into Nanochains and Nanobundles|journal=ACS Nano|date=27 October 2015|volume=9|issue=10|pages=9700\u20139707|doi=10.1021/acsnano.5b02328}}</ref> In the \"top-down\" approach, nano-objects are constructed from larger entities without atomic-level control.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Nature Nanotechnology|author=Rodgers, P. |year=2006|title=Nanoelectronics: Single file|doi=10.1038/nnano.2006.5}}</ref>\n\nAreas of physics such as [[nanoelectronics]], [[nanomechanics]], [[nanophotonics]] and [[nanoionics]] have evolved during the last few decades to provide a basic scientific foundation of nanotechnology.\n\n===Larger to smaller: a materials perspective===\n[[File:Atomic resolution Au100.JPG|right|thumb|Image of [[Surface reconstruction|reconstruction]] on a clean [[Gold]]([[Miller index|100]]) surface, as visualized using [[scanning tunneling microscopy]]. The positions of the individual atoms composing the surface are visible.]]\n\n{{main article|Nanomaterials}}\n\nSeveral phenomena become pronounced as the size of the system decreases. These include [[statistical mechanics|statistical mechanical]] effects, as well as [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] effects, for example the \"[[quantum]] size effect\" where the electronic properties of solids are altered with great reductions in particle size. This effect does not come into play by going from macro to micro dimensions. However, quantum effects can become significant when the nanometer size range is reached, typically at distances of 100 nanometers or less, the so-called [[quantum realm]]. Additionally, a number of physical (mechanical, electrical, optical, etc.) properties change when compared to macroscopic systems. One example is the increase in surface area to volume ratio altering mechanical, thermal and catalytic properties of materials. Diffusion and reactions at nanoscale, nanostructures materials and nanodevices with fast ion transport are generally referred to nanoionics. ''Mechanical'' properties of nanosystems are of interest in the nanomechanics research. The catalytic activity of nanomaterials also opens potential risks in their interaction with [[biomaterial]]s.\n\nMaterials reduced to the nanoscale can show different properties compared to what they exhibit on a macroscale, enabling unique applications. For instance, opaque substances can become transparent (copper); stable materials can turn combustible (aluminium); insoluble materials may become soluble (gold). A material such as gold, which is chemically inert at normal scales, can serve as a potent chemical [[catalyst]] at nanoscales. Much of the fascination with nanotechnology stems from these quantum and surface phenomena that matter exhibits at the nanoscale.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lubick N | year = 2008 | title = Silver socks have cloudy lining | url = | journal = Environ Sci Technol | volume = 42 | issue = 11| page = 3910 | pmid=18589943 | doi = 10.1021/es0871199 | last2 = Betts | first2 = Kellyn|bibcode = 2008EnST...42.3910L }}</ref>\n\n===Simple to complex: a molecular perspective===\n{{Main article|Molecular self-assembly}}\n\nModern [[chemical synthesis|synthetic chemistry]] has reached the point where it is possible to prepare small molecules to almost any structure. These methods are used today to manufacture a wide variety of useful chemicals such as [[drug|pharmaceuticals]] or commercial [[polymer]]s. This ability raises the question of extending this kind of control to the next-larger level, seeking methods to assemble these single molecules into [[supramolecular assembly|supramolecular assemblies]] consisting of many molecules arranged in a well defined manner.\n\nThese approaches utilize the concepts of molecular self-assembly and/or [[supramolecular chemistry]] to automatically arrange themselves into some useful conformation through a [[Top-down and bottom-up#Nanotechnology|bottom-up]] approach. The concept of molecular recognition is especially important: molecules can be designed so that a specific configuration or arrangement is favored due to [[Noncovalent bonding|non-covalent]] [[intermolecular force]]s. The Watson\u2013Crick [[base pair|basepairing]] rules are a direct result of this, as is the specificity of an [[enzyme]] being targeted to a single [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]], or the specific [[protein folding|folding of the protein]] itself. Thus, two or more components can be designed to be complementary and mutually attractive so that they make a more complex and useful whole.\n\nSuch bottom-up approaches should be capable of producing devices in parallel and be much cheaper than top-down methods, but could potentially be overwhelmed as the size and complexity of the desired assembly increases. Most useful structures require complex and thermodynamically unlikely arrangements of atoms. Nevertheless, there are many examples of self-assembly based on molecular recognition in [[biology]], most notably Watson\u2013Crick basepairing and enzyme-substrate interactions. The challenge for nanotechnology is whether these principles can be used to engineer new constructs in addition to natural ones.\n\n===Molecular nanotechnology: a long-term view===\n{{Main article|Molecular nanotechnology}}\n\nMolecular nanotechnology, sometimes called molecular manufacturing, describes engineered nanosystems (nanoscale machines) operating on the molecular scale. Molecular nanotechnology is especially associated with the [[molecular assembler]], a machine that can produce a desired structure or device atom-by-atom using the principles of [[mechanosynthesis]]. Manufacturing in the context of [[productive nanosystems]] is not related to, and should be clearly distinguished from, the conventional technologies used to manufacture nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and nanoparticles.\n\nWhen the term \"nanotechnology\" was independently coined and popularized by [[Eric Drexler]] (who at the time was unaware of an [[History of nanotechnology|earlier usage]] by Norio Taniguchi) it referred to a future manufacturing technology based on [[molecular machine]] systems. The premise was that molecular scale biological analogies of traditional machine components demonstrated molecular machines were possible: by the countless examples found in biology, it is known that sophisticated, [[stochastic]]ally optimised [[Molecular machine#Biological|biological machines]] can be produced.\n\nIt is hoped that developments in nanotechnology will make possible their construction by some other means, perhaps using [[biomimetic]] principles. However, Drexler and other researchers<ref>Phoenix, Chris (March 2005) [http://www.crnano.org/developing.htm Nanotechnology: Developing Molecular Manufacturing]. crnano.org</ref> have proposed that advanced nanotechnology, although perhaps initially implemented by biomimetic means, ultimately could be based on mechanical engineering principles, namely, a manufacturing technology based on the mechanical functionality of these components (such as gears, bearings, motors, and structural members) that would enable programmable, positional assembly to atomic specification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imm.org/PNAS.html|title=Some papers by K. Eric Drexler|work=imm.org}}</ref> The physics and engineering performance of exemplar designs were analyzed in Drexler's book ''Nanosystems''.\n\nIn general it is very difficult to assemble devices on the atomic scale, as one has to position atoms on other atoms of comparable size and stickiness. Another view, put forth by Carlo Montemagno,<ref>[http://www.cnsi.ucla.edu/institution/personnel?personnel%5fid=105488 Carlo Montemagno, Ph.D.] California NanoSystems Institute</ref> is that future nanosystems will be hybrids of silicon technology and biological molecular machines. Richard Smalley argued that mechanosynthesis are impossible due to the difficulties in mechanically manipulating individual molecules.\n\nThis led to an exchange of letters in the [[American Chemical Society|ACS]] publication [[Chemical & Engineering News]] in 2003.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/8148/8148counterpoint.html |title=Cover Story \u2013 Nanotechnology|date=December 1, 2003|volume =81|issue=48|journal=Chemical and Engineering News|pages=37\u201342}}</ref> Though biology clearly demonstrates that molecular machine systems are possible, non-biological molecular machines are today only in their infancy.

Because of the discrete (i.e. atomic) nature of matter and the possibility of exponential growth, this stage is seen as the basis of another industrial revolution. [[Mihail Roco]], one of the architects of the USA's National Nanotechnology Initiative, has proposed four states of nanotechnology that seem to parallel the technical progress of the Industrial Revolution, progressing from passive nanostructures to active nanodevices to complex [[nanomachine]]s and ultimately to productive nanosystems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/nano/reports/mcr_05-0526_intpersp_nano.pdf |title=International Perspective on Government Nanotechnology Funding in 2005}}</ref>\n*[[Programmable matter]] seeks to design materials whose properties can be easily, reversibly and externally controlled though a fusion of [[information science]] and [[materials science]].\n*Due to the popularity and media exposure of the term nanotechnology, the words [[picotechnology]] and [[femtotechnology]] have been coined in analogy to it, although these are only used rarely and informally.\n\n===Dimensionality in nanomaterials===\nNanomaterials can be classified in 0D, 1D, 2D and 3D [[nanomaterials]]. The dimensionality play a major role in determining the characteristic of nanomaterials including [[:wikt:physical|physical]], [[chemical]] and [[biological]] characteristics. With the decrease in dimensionality, an increase in surface-to-volume ratio is observed. This indicate that smaller dimensional [[nanomaterials]] have higher surface area compared to 3D nanomaterials. Recently, [[two dimensional (2D) nanomaterials]] are extensively investigated for [[electronics|electronic]], [[biomedical]], [[drug delivery]] and [[biosensor]] applications.\n\n==Tools and techniques==\n[[File:AFMsetup.jpg|thumb|right|296px|Typical [[Atomic force microscope|AFM]] setup. A microfabricated [[cantilever]] with a sharp tip is deflected by features on a sample surface, much like in a [[phonograph]] but on a much smaller scale. A [[laser]] beam reflects off the backside of the cantilever into a set of [[photodetector]]s, allowing the deflection to be measured and assembled into an image of the surface.]]\n\nThere are several important modern developments. The [[atomic force microscope]] (AFM) and the [[Scanning Tunneling Microscope]] (STM) are two early versions of scanning probes that launched nanotechnology. There are other types of [[scanning probe microscopy]]. Although conceptually similar to the scanning [[confocal microscope]] developed by [[Marvin Minsky]] in 1961 and the [[scanning acoustic microscope]] (SAM) developed by [[Calvin Quate]] and coworkers in the 1970s, newer scanning probe microscopes have much higher resolution, since they are not limited by the wavelength of sound or light.\n\nThe tip of a scanning probe can also be used to manipulate nanostructures (a process called positional assembly). [[Feature-oriented scanning]] methodology may be a promising way to implement these nanomanipulations in automatic mode.<ref name=\"feature2004\">{{cite journal|author=Lapshin, R.

Lithography is a top-down fabrication technique where a bulk material is reduced in size to nanoscale pattern.\n\nAnother group of nanotechnological techniques include those used for fabrication of [[Ion track technology (track etching)|nanotubes]] and [[Ion track technology (track replication)|nanowires]], those used in semiconductor fabrication such as deep ultraviolet lithography, electron beam lithography, focused ion beam machining, nanoimprint lithography, atomic layer deposition, and molecular vapor deposition, and further including molecular self-assembly techniques such as those employing di-block copolymers. The precursors of these techniques preceded the nanotech era, and are extensions in the development of scientific advancements rather than techniques which were devised with the sole purpose of creating nanotechnology and which were results of nanotechnology research.<ref name=\"pmid26295171\">Kafshgari MH, Voelcker NH, Harding FJ (2015) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=26295171 Applications of zero-valent silicon nanostructures in biomedicine.] ''Nanomedicine (Lond)'' 10 (16):2553-71. {{DOI|10.2217/nnm.15.91}} PMID 26295171</ref>\n\nThe top-down approach anticipates nanodevices that must be built piece by piece in stages, much as manufactured items are made. Scanning probe microscopy is an important technique both for characterization and synthesis of nanomaterials. Atomic force microscopes and scanning tunneling microscopes can be used to look at surfaces and to move atoms around. By designing different tips for these microscopes, they can be used for carving out structures on surfaces and to help guide self-assembling structures. By using, for example, feature-oriented scanning approach, atoms or molecules can be moved around on a surface with scanning probe microscopy techniques.<ref name=\"feature2004\"/><ref name=\"fospm2011\"/> At present, it is expensive and time-consuming for mass production but very suitable for laboratory experimentation.\n\nIn contrast, bottom-up techniques build or grow larger structures atom by atom or molecule by molecule. These techniques include chemical synthesis, [[self-assembly]] and positional assembly. [[Dual polarisation interferometry]] is one tool suitable for characterisation of self assembled thin films. Another variation of the bottom-up approach is [[molecular beam epitaxy]] or MBE. Researchers at [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] like John R. Arthur. Alfred Y. Cho, and Art C. Gossard developed and implemented MBE as a research tool in the late 1960s and 1970s. Samples made by MBE were key to the discovery of the fractional quantum Hall effect for which the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded. MBE allows scientists to lay down atomically precise layers of atoms and, in the process, build up complex structures. Important for research on semiconductors, MBE is also widely used to make samples and devices for the newly emerging field of [[spintronics]].\n\nHowever, new therapeutic products, based on responsive nanomaterials, such as the ultradeformable, stress-sensitive [[Transfersome]] vesicles, are under development and already approved for human use in some countries.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rajan|first=Reshmy|last2=Jose|first2=Shoma|last3=Mukund|first3=V.

Platinum is currently used as the diesel engine [[Catalysis|catalyst]] in these engines. The catalyst is what cleans the exhaust fume particles. First a reduction catalyst is employed to take nitrogen atoms from NOx molecules in order to free oxygen. Next the oxidation catalyst oxidizes the hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide to form carbon dioxide and water.<ref>[[Catalytic converter#Diesel engines|''Catalytic Converter'']] at Wikipedia.org</ref> Platinum is used in both the reduction and the oxidation catalysts.<ref>[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/catalytic-converter2.htm ''How Catalytic Converters Work''] at howstuffworks.com</ref> Using platinum though, is inefficient in that it is expensive and unsustainable. Danish company InnovationsFonden invested DKK 15 million in a search for new catalyst substitutes using nanotechnology. The goal of the project, launched in the autumn of 2014, is to maximize surface area and minimize the amount of material required. Objects tend to minimize their surface energy; two drops of water, for example, will join to form one drop and decrease surface area. If the catalyst's surface area that is exposed to the exhaust fumes is maximized, efficiency of the catalyst is maximized. The team working on this project aims to create nanoparticles that will not merge. Every time the surface is optimized, material is saved. Thus, creating these nanoparticles will increase the effectiveness of the resulting diesel engine catalyst\u2014in turn leading to cleaner exhaust fumes\u2014and will decrease cost. If successful, the team hopes to reduce platinum use by 25%.<ref>[http://www.rdmag.com/news/2014/09/nanotechnology-provide-cleaner-diesel-engines ''Nanotechnology to provide cleaner diesel engines''].
