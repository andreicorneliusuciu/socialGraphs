This is typically to finish an \"entry\" and begin the desired process, and is usually an alternative to pressing an [[OK#Computers|OK button]].\n\nThe \"[[Carriage return|return]]\" key is often also referred to by many American groups{{who|date=December 2012}} (and even marked) as the \"enter\" key, and they usually perform identical functions; however in some particular applications (mainly [[page layout]], [[word processing]] and in [[Typewriter|typewriting]]), \"return\" operates specifically like the [[carriage return]] key from which it originates. It normally has an arrow pointing down and left (\u23ce or \u21b5), which is the symbol for carriage return. In contrast, the \"Enter\" key is commonly labelled with its name in plain text on generic PC keyboards, or with the symbol \u2324 ([[Unicode|U]]+2324 {{smallcaps|up arrowhead between two horizontal bars}}) on many [[Apple Inc|Apple]] [[Apple Macintosh|Mac]] keyboards.<ref>{{cite web|author=Joe Weaks |url=http://macbiblioblog.blogspot.com/2005/05/special-key-symbols.html |title=The Macintosh Biblioblog: Special Key Symbols |publisher=Macbiblioblog.blogspot.com |date=2005-05-15 |accessdate=2016-07-16}}</ref>)\n\nThe enter key is typically located on the lower right of the numeric keypad, and the return/enter key on the right edge of the main alphanumeric portion of the keyboard, between [[backspace]] and the right-hand [[shift key|shift]] (and/or [[control key|control]]) key (as well as below the [[backslash]] key on keyboards using a standard ANSI / [[US-International]] layout).\n\nThe return/enter key can have various physical shapes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deskthority.net/wiki/Return_key |title=Deskthority Wiki Return Key}}</ref>\n\n==Differences between Enter and Return==\n[[File:Commodore-64-Computer.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Commodore 64]] (made in [[1982 in video gaming|1982]]) had only the \"return\" key.]]\nOn some keyboard layouts, the return and enter key are two different keys, an artifact of the differing handling of [[newline]]s by different operating systems. As an example, on the [[Macintosh]], the return key is the usual key, while the enter key is positioned at the lower right of the numeric key pad. While using the type tool in [[Adobe Photoshop]], the return key produces a new line while the enter key ends editing mode.\n\nOn IBM's [[IBM 3270|3270]] and [[IBM 5250|5250]] line of [[Computer terminal|terminals]], the Enter key was located to the right of the space bar and was used to send the contents of the terminal's buffer to the host computer. The Return key was located in a more standard location and was used to generate a new line.\n\nApple also took advantage of this situation to create an editable command line environment called a \"Worksheet\" in the [[Macintosh Programmer's Workshop]], where return was used strictly as a formatting key while enter was used to execute a shell command or series of commands in [[direct mode]].\n\nIn technical terms, the Macintosh keyboard maps the return key to a [[carriage return]], while the enter key maps to a newline.\n\nHistorically, many computer models did not have a separate keypad, and only had one button to function as Enter or Return.  For example, the [[Commodore 64]] (manufactured from [[1982 in video gaming|1982]]) had only the \"Return\" key.\n\nIn [[Mathematica]], the Return key creates a new line, whereas the Enter key (or Shift-Return) submits the current command for execution.\n\n==Uses==\nIn [[Calculator|pocket calculator]]-like programs (for example, [[Calculator (Windows)|Microsoft Calculator]] for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] users), the enter key of the [[numeric keypad]] acts like the ''equal to'' (=) button to obtain the result of the previously entered operations.\n\n[[File:Fl Return Button.png|thumb|right|Return button of the [[FLTK]] toolkit showing the Return symbol]]\nIn graphical computer applications, the enter or return key is often used to close and submit a form the user is editing. Usually the default \"OK\" or \"Save\" button on a form is highlighted and sometimes shows a Return symbol, giving a subtle visual clue that the user has the option of clicking the button or simply pressing Enter.\n\nIn modern [[Word processor|word processing applications]], pressing the return key ends a paragraph and starts a new one. Spacing between the paragraphs can be defined through paragraph styles.\n\nBefore computers, on electric typewriters the \u201cReturn\u201d key was kept comparatively large. This is due to the frequency of usage (which also includes the space bar), and therefore, is kept large to reduce the likelihood of [[Typographical error|finger slips]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Carriage return]]\n* [[Numeric keypad]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{keyboard}}\n{{keyboard keys}}\n\n[[Category:Computer keys]]\n\n[[da:Tastatur#Enter]]"}]}}}}
