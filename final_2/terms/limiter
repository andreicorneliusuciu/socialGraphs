Limiting is a type of [[dynamic range compression]]. [[Clipping (audio)]] is an extreme version of limiting.\n\n'''Limiting''' is any process by which a specified characteristic (usually amplitude) of the output of a device is prevented from exceeding a predetermined value.\n\nLimiters are common as a safety device in live sound and broadcast applications to prevent sudden volume peaks from occurring. Limiters are also used as protective features in some components of [[sound reinforcement system]]s (e.g., powered [[mixing board]]s and [[power amplifier]]s) and in some [[bass amp]]s, to prevent unwanted [[distortion (music)|distortion]] or speaker damage.\n\n==Types==\nLimiting can refer to non-linear [[clipping (signal processing)|clipping]], in which a signal is passed through normally but \"sheared off\" when it would normally exceed a certain threshold.  It can also refer to a type of variable-gain [[audio level compression]], in which the gain of an amplifier is changed very quickly to prevent the signal from going over a certain amplitude.\n\n*''Hard limiting'' (\"[[clipping (signal processing)|clipping]]\") is a limiting action in which there is\n**(a) over the permitted [[dynamic range]], negligible variation in the expected characteristic of the output [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]], and\n**(b) a steady-state signal, at the maximum permitted level, for the duration of each period when the output would otherwise be required to exceed the permitted dynamic range in order to correspond to the [[transfer function]] of the device.\n*''Soft limiting'' is limiting in which the transfer function of a device is a function of its instantaneous or integrated output level. The output [[waveform]] is therefore distorted, but not clipped.\n\n==In amplifiers==\n[[Bass instrument amplifier]]s and power amplifiers are more commonly equipped with limiter circuitry to prevent overloading the power amplifier and to protect speakers. [[Guitar amplifier|Electric guitar amps]] do not usually have limiters.\n\n[[PIN diode]]s can be used in '''limiter''' circuits to reflect the energy back to the source or clip the signal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skyworksinc.com/uploads/documents/200480C.pdf |title=PIN Limiter Diodes in Receiver Protectors |publisher=Skyworks |accessdate=2015-07-28}}</ref>\n\n==In FM radio==\nAn [[FM radio]] receiver usually has at least one stage of amplification for this purpose. It provides a constant level of signal to the FM [[demodulator]] stage, reducing the effect of signal level changes in the output.  If two or more signals are received at the same time, a high performance limiter stage can greatly reduce the effect of the weaker signals on the output. This is commonly referred to as the FM [[capture effect]].\n\nGenerally, FM demodulators are not affected by amplitude variations, since the baseband is contained in the frequency deviations. Some detectors, including the [[Detector (radio)#Ratio detector|ratio detector]], inherently limit gain by a nature of the circuit design. In [[AM radio]], the intelligence is located in the amplitude variations, and distortion can occur due to spurious signals that could cause the baseband to be misrepresented.\n\n==In audio production==\n[[Mastering engineer]]s often use limiting combined with make-up gain to increase the perceived [[loudness]] of an audio recording during the [[audio mastering]] process.<ref>{{cite book |title=Mastering Audio: the art and science |edition=3rd |author=Bob Katz |publisher=Focal Press |date=2015 |isbn=978-0-240-81896-2 |page=81}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1709&context=etd|title=Audio Mastering as Musical Practice|last=Shelvock|first=Matt|publisher=University of Western Ontario: EDT|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{FS1037C MS188}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dynamic range compression]]\n* [[Flow limiter]]\n* [[Limiting]]\n* [[Negative feedback]]\n* [[Voltage-controlled amplifier]]\n\n[[Category:Electronic circuits]]\n[[Category:Dynamics processing]]"}]}}}}
