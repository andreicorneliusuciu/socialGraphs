The name was established by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) in 1930.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iec.ch/about/history/overview/ |title=IEC History |publisher=Iec.ch |date=1904-09-15 |accessdate=2012-04-28}}</ref> It was adopted by the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM) (''Conf\u00e9rence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des poids et mesures'') in 1960, replacing the previous name for the unit, ''[[cycle per second|cycles per second]]'' (cps), along with its related multiples, primarily ''kilocycles per second'' (kc/s) and ''megacycles per second'' (Mc/s), and occasionally ''kilomegacycles per second'' (kMc/s). The term ''cycles per second'' was largely replaced by ''hertz'' by the 1970s. One hobby magazine, ''Electronics Illustrated'', declared their intention to stick with the traditional kc., Mc., etc. units.<ref>{{cite magazine\n|last=Cartwright |first=Rufus |date=March 1967 |title=Will Success Spoil Heinrich Hertz? |URL=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Electronics-Illustrated/Electronics-Illustrated-1967-03.pdf |format=PDF |access-date=2016-03-29 |magazine=Electronics Illustrated |pages=98\u201399 |publisher=Fawcett Publications, Inc. |editor-last=Beason |editor-first=Robert G.}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:Wave frequency.gif|thumb|400px|A [[sine wave]] with varying frequency]]\n[[File:Wiggers Diagram.svg|thumb|400px|[[Cardiac cycle|A heartbeat]] is an example of a non-[[Sine wave|sinusoidal]] periodic phenomenon that may be analyzed in terms of frequency.

Humans perceive frequency of sound waves as [[Pitch (music)|pitch]]. Each [[musical note]] corresponds to a particular frequency which can be measured in hertz. An infant's ear is able to perceive frequencies ranging from 20&nbsp;Hz to 20,000&nbsp;Hz; the average [[Adult|adult human]] can hear sounds between 20&nbsp;Hz and 16,000&nbsp;Hz.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ernst Terhardt |url=http://www.mmk.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de/persons/ter/top/dominant.html |title=Dominant spectral region |publisher=Mmk.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de |date=2000-02-20 |accessdate=2012-04-28}}</ref> The range of [[ultrasound]], [[infrasound]] and other physical vibrations such as [[molecular vibration|molecular]] and [[atom vibrations|atomic vibrations]] extends from a few [[femto]]Hz<ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2003/09sep_blackholesounds/|title=Black Hole Sound Waves - Science Mission Directorate|publisher=science.nasa.go}}</ref> into the [[tera-|tera]]hertz range<ref>[[atom vibrations|Atomic vibrations]] are typically on the order of tens of terahertz</ref> and beyond.\n\n===Electromagnetic radiation===\n[[Electromagnetic radiation]] is often described by its frequency\u2014the number of [[oscillation]]s of the perpendicular electric and magnetic fields per second\u2014expressed in hertz.\n\nRadio frequency radiation is usually measured in kilohertz (kHz), megahertz (MHz), or gigahertz (GHz). [[Light]] is electromagnetic radiation that is even higher in frequency, and has frequencies in the range of tens ([[infrared]]) to thousands ([[ultraviolet]]) of terahertz. Electromagnetic radiation with frequencies in the low terahertz range, (intermediate between those of the highest normally usable radio frequencies and long-wave infrared light), is often called [[terahertz radiation]]. Even higher frequencies exist, such as that of [[gamma ray]]s, which can be measured in exahertz. (For historical reasons, the frequencies of light and higher frequency electromagnetic radiation are more commonly specified in terms of their [[wavelength]]s or [[photon]] [[Energy|energies]]: for a more detailed treatment of this and the above frequency ranges, see [[electromagnetic spectrum]].)\n\n===Computers===\n{{details|topic=why the frequency, including for gigahertz (GHz) etc., is a flawed speed indicator for computers|Megahertz myth}}\nIn computers, most [[central processing unit]]s (CPU) are labeled in terms of their [[clock rate]] expressed in megahertz or gigahertz (10<sup>6</sup> or 10<sup>9</sup> hertz, respectively). This number refers to the frequency of the CPU's master [[clock signal]] (\"[[clock rate]]\"). This signal is a [[square wave]], which is an electrical voltage that switches between low and high values at regular intervals. Hertz has become the primary unit of measurement accepted by the general populace to determine the performance of a CPU, but many experts have criticized this approach, which they claim is an [[Megahertz myth|easily manipulable benchmark]] as some processors use multiple clock periods to perform a single operation, while others can perform multiple operations in a single cycle.<ref>{{cite web|first=Amit |last=Asaravala |url=http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,62851,00.html |title=Good Riddance, Gigahertz |website=Wired.com |date=2004-03-30 |accessdate=2012-04-28}}</ref> For home-based personal computers, CPU clock speeds have ranged from approximately 1&nbsp;MHz in the late 1970s ([[Atari]], [[Commodore International|Commodore]], [[Apple computers]]) to up to 6&nbsp;GHz in IBM POWER processors.\n\nVarious [[Bus (computing)|computer buses]], such as the [[front-side bus]] connecting the CPU and [[Northbridge (computing)|northbridge]], also operate at various frequencies in the megahertz range.\n\nThe \"speed\" or the more correct term [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] of networks, including [[wireless]], such as [[Wi-Fi]], [[3G]], [[4G]], [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]], etc. is not affected by the myth described above. In general, higher frequency means higher bandwidth or bit rates, that lower the times to download big files. In general, however, higher frequencies do not pass through walls, making lower frequencies an advantage e.g. indoors (most common equipment reports the highest frequency used, but usually also work at lower, making this often not a problem). Bandwidth is often equated with \"speed\", while [[latency (engineering)|latency]] (\"lag\"), is the perceived problem, that is a distinct measure from bandwidth, while higher bandwidth has an influence on latency.\n\n== SI multiples ==\n<!-- Other articles link here. -->\n{{SI multiples\n| symbol=Hz\n| unit=hertz\n| note=Common prefixed units are in bold face.\n| k=|M=|G=|T=|\n| anchor=SI_prefixed_forms_of_hertz\n| right=\n}}\n\nHigher frequencies than the International System of Units provides prefixes for are believed to occur naturally in the frequencies of the quantum-mechanical vibrations of high-energy, or, equivalently, massive particles, although these are not directly observable and must be inferred from their interactions with other phenomena. For practical reasons, these are typically not expressed in hertz, but in terms of the equivalent quantum energy, which is proportional to the frequency by the factor of [[Planck constant|Planck's constant]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Alternating current]]\n* [[Bandwidth (signal processing)]]\n* [[Electronic tuner]]\n* [[FLOPS]]\n* [[Frequency changer]]\n* [[Normalized frequency (digital signal processing)|Normalized frequency]]\n* [[Orders of magnitude (frequency)]]\n* [[Periodic function]]\n* [[Radian per second]]\n* [[Rate (mathematics)|Rate]]\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter2/2-1/second.html BIPM Cesium ion f<sub>Cs</sub> definition]\n* [http://archive.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/projects/inms/fountain-clock.html National Research Council of Canada: ''Cesium fountain clock'']\n* [http://www.npl.co.uk/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.1086 National Physical Laboratory: ''Trapped ion optical frequency standards'']\n* [http://archive.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/projects/inms/trapped-ion.html National Research Council of Canada: ''Optical frequency standard based on a single trapped ion'']\n* [http://archive.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/projects/inms/optical-comb.html National Research Council of Canada: ''Optical frequency comb'']\n* [http://onlinetonegenerator.com Online Tone Generator]\n\n{{SI units}}\n\n[[Category:SI derived units]]\n[[Category:Units of frequency]]\n[[Category:Heinrich Hertz]]"}]}}}}
