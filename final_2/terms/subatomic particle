But it also reflects the modern understanding that at the [[quantum physics|quantum]] scale [[matter]] and [[energy]] behave very differently from what much of everyday experience would lead us to expect.\n\nThe idea of a particle underwent serious rethinking when experiments showed that light could behave like a stream of particles (called [[photon]]s) as well as exhibit wave-like properties. This led to the new concept of [[wave\u2013particle duality]] to reflect that quantum-scale \"particles\" behave like both particles and waves (also known as [[Wave\u2013particle duality|wavicles]]). Another new concept, the [[uncertainty principle]], states that some of their properties taken together, such as their simultaneous [[position (vector)|position]] and [[momentum]], cannot be measured exactly.<ref>{{Citation |first=W. |last=Heisenberg |title=\u00dcber den anschaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik  |language=de|journal=[[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik]] |volume=43 |issue=3\u20134 |date=1927 |pages=172\u2013198 |doi=10.1007/BF01397280 |postscript=. |bibcode = 1927ZPhy...43..172H }}</ref> In more recent times, wave\u2013particle duality has been shown to apply not only to photons but to increasingly massive particles as well.<ref>\n{{Cite journal\n | date = 2000\n | title = Wave-particle duality of C60 molecules\n | first6 =Anton\n | last6 =Zeilinger\n | first5 =Gerbrand\n | last5 =Van Der Zouw\n | first4 =Claudia\n | last4 =Keller\n | first3 =Julian\n | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]\n | last3 =Vos-Andreae\n | volume = 401\n | first2 =Olaf\n | doi =10.1038/44348\n | last2 =Nairz\n | bibcode = 1999Natur.401..680A |issue= 6754 |pages = 680\u2013682\n | last1 = Arndt\n | first1 = Markus\n| pmid=18494170\n}}</ref>\n\nInteractions of particles in the framework of [[quantum field theory]] are understood as creation and annihilation of ''[[quantum|quanta]]'' of corresponding [[fundamental interaction]]s.

For example, a proton is made of two [[up quark]]s and one [[down quark]], while the atomic nucleus of [[helium-4]] is composed of two protons and two [[neutron]]s. The neutron is made of two down quarks and one up quark. Composite particles include all [[hadron]]s: these include [[baryon]]s (such as [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s) and [[meson]]s (such as [[pion]]s and [[kaon]]s).\n\n===By mass===\nIn [[special relativity]], the [[Mass\u2013energy equivalence|energy of a particle at rest equals its mass times the speed of light squared]], {{nowrap begin}}''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>{{nowrap end}}. That is, [[mass]] can be expressed in terms of [[energy]] and vice versa. If a particle has a [[frame of reference]] where it lies [[rest (physics)|at rest]], then it has a positive [[rest mass]] and is referred to as ''massive''.\n\nAll composite particles are massive. Baryons (meaning \"heavy\") tend to have greater mass than mesons (meaning \"intermediate\"), which in turn tend to be heavier than leptons (meaning \"lightweight\"), but the heaviest lepton (the [[tau particle]]) is heavier than the two lightest flavours of baryons ([[nucleon]]s). It is also certain that any particle with an [[electric charge]] is massive.\n\nAll [[massless particle]]s (particles whose [[invariant mass]] is zero) are elementary. These include the photon and gluon, although the latter cannot be isolated.\n\n==Other properties==\n\nThrough the work of [[Albert Einstein]], [[Louis de Broglie]], and many others, current scientific theory holds that ''all'' particles also have a wave nature.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n | author = Walter Greiner\n | date = 2001\n | title = Quantum Mechanics: An Introduction\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7qCMUfwoQcAC&pg=PA29\n | page = 29\n | publisher = [[Springer (publisher)|Springer]]\n | isbn = 3-540-67458-6\n}}</ref> This has been verified not only for elementary particles but also for compound particles like atoms and even molecules.

The most fundamental of these are the laws of [[conservation of energy]] and [[conservation of momentum]], which let us make calculations of particle interactions on scales of magnitude that range from stars to [[quark]]s.<ref>[[Isaac Newton]] (1687). [[Newton's Laws of Motion]] (''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'')</ref> These are the prerequisite basics of [[Newtonian mechanics]], a series of statements and equations in ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', originally published in 1687.\n\n==Dividing an atom==\nThe negatively charged electron has a mass equal to {{frac|1837 or 1836}} of that of a [[hydrogen]] atom. The remainder of the hydrogen atom's mass comes from the positively charged [[proton]]. The [[atomic number]] of an element is the number of protons in its nucleus. Neutrons are neutral particles having a mass slightly greater than that of the proton. Different [[isotope]]s of the same element contain the same number of protons but differing numbers of neutrons. The [[mass number]] of an isotope is the total number of [[nucleon]]s (neutrons and protons collectively).\n\n[[Chemistry]] concerns itself with how electron sharing binds atoms into structures such as crystals and [[molecule]]s. [[Nuclear physics]] deals with how protons and neutrons arrange themselves in nuclei. The study of subatomic particles, atoms and molecules, and their structure and interactions, requires [[quantum mechanics]]. Analyzing processes that change the numbers and types of particles requires [[quantum field theory]]. The study of subatomic particles ''per se'' is called [[particle physics]]. The term ''[[high-energy physics]]'' is nearly synonymous to \"particle physics\" since creation of particles requires high energies: it occurs only as a result of [[cosmic ray]]s, or in [[particle accelerator]]s. [[phenomenology (particle physics)|Particle phenomenology]] systematizes the knowledge about subatomic particles obtained from these experiments.\nTotal known Isotopes of Hydrogen - Deuterium and tritium - 2\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of subatomic physics|Timeline of particle discoveries}}\nThe term \"''subatomic'' particle\" is largely a [[retronym]] of 1960s made to distinguish a big number of [[baryon]]s and [[meson]]s (that comprise [[hadron]]s) from particles that are now thought to be [[elementary particle|truly elementary]].
