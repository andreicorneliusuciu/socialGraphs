The surface formed is a [[surface of revolution]]; it encloses a solid of revolution.]]\nIn [[mathematics]], [[engineering]], and [[manufacturing]], a '''solid of revolution''' is a [[Shape|solid figure]] obtained by rotating a [[plane curve]] around some [[straight line]] (the [[axis of rotation|axis]]) that lies on the same plane.\n\nAssuming that the curve does not cross the axis, the solid's [[volume]] is equal to the [[length]] of the [[circle]] described by the figure's [[centroid]] multiplied by the figure's [[area]] ([[Pappus's centroid theorem|Pappus's second centroid Theorem]]).\n\nA '''representative disk''' is a three-[[dimension]]al [[volume element]] of a solid of revolution.  The element is created by [[rotation|rotating]] a [[line segment]] (of [[length]] {{mvar|w}}) around some axis (located {{mvar|r}} units away), so that a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] [[volume]] of {{math|\u03c0''r''<sup>2</sup>''w''}} units is enclosed.\n\n==Finding the volume==\nTwo common methods for finding the volume of a solid of revolution are the disc method and the shell method of integration. To apply these methods, it is easiest to draw the graph in question; identify the area that is to be revolved about the axis of revolution; determine the volume of either a disc-shaped slice of the solid, with thickness {{mvar|\u03b4x}}, or a cylindrical shell of width {{mvar|\u03b4x}}; and then find the limiting sum of these volumes as {{mvar|\u03b4x}} approaches 0, a value which may be found by evaluating a suitable integral.\n\n===Disc method===\n[[File:Disc integration.svg|thumb|right|Disc integration about the y-axis]]\n{{main|Disk integration}}\n\nThe disc method is used when the slice that was drawn is ''perpendicular to'' the axis of revolution; i.e. when integrating ''parallel to'' the axis of revolution.\n\nThe volume of the solid formed by rotating the area between the curves of {{math|''f''(''x'')}} and {{math|''g''(''x'')}} and the lines {{math|1=''x'' = ''a''}} and {{math|1=''x'' = ''b''}} about the {{mvar|x}}-axis is given by\n:<math>V = \\pi \\int_a^b \\left| f(x)^2 - g(x)^2\\right|\\,dx\\, .</math>\nIf {{math|1=''g''(''x'') = 0}} (e.g. revolving an area between the curve and the {{mvar|x}}-axis), this reduces to:\n:<math>V = \\pi \\int_a^b f(x)^2 \\,dx\\, .</math>\n\nThe method can be visualized by considering a thin horizontal rectangle at {{mvar|y}} between {{math|''f''(''y'')}} on top and {{math|''g''(''y'')}} on the bottom, and revolving it about the {{mvar|y}}-axis; it forms a ring (or disc in the case that {{math|1=''g''(''y'') = 0}}), with outer radius {{math|''f''(''y'')}} and inner radius {{math|''g''(''y'')}}.  The area of a ring is {{math|\u03c0(''R''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''r''<sup>2</sup>)}}, where {{mvar|R}} is the outer radius (in this case {{math|''f''(''y'')}}), and {{mvar|r}} is the inner radius (in this case {{math|''g''(''y'')}}). The volume of each infinitesimal disc is therefore {{math|\u03c0''f''(''y'')<sup>2</sup> ''dy''}}. The limit of the Riemann sum of the volumes of the discs between {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} becomes integral (1).\n\n===Cylinder method===\n[[File:Shell integration.svg|thumb|right|Shell integration]]\n{{main|Shell integration}}\n\nThe cylinder method is used when the slice that was drawn is ''parallel to'' the axis of revolution; i.e. when integrating ''perpendicular to'' the axis of revolution.\n\nThe volume of the solid formed by rotating the area between the curves of {{math|''f''(''x'')}} and {{math|''g''(''x'')}} and the lines {{math|1=''x'' = ''a''}} and {{math|1=''x'' = ''b''}} about the {{mvar|y}}-axis is given by\n:<math>V = 2\\pi \\int_a^b x |f(x) - g(x)|\\,dx\\, .</math>\nIf {{math|1=''g''(''x'') = 0}} (e.g. revolving an area between curve and {{mvar|y}}-axis), this reduces to:\n:<math>V = 2\\pi \\int_a^b x | f(x) | \\,dx\\, .</math>\n\nThe method can be visualized by considering a thin vertical rectangle at {{mvar|x}} with height {{math|''f''(''x'') \u2212 ''g''(''x'')}}, and revolving it about the {{mvar|y}}-axis; it forms a cylindrical shell.  The lateral surface area of a cylinder is {{math|2\u03c0''rh''}}, where {{mvar|r}} is the radius (in this case {{mvar|x}}), and {{mvar|h}} is the height (in this case {{math|''f''(''x'') \u2212 ''g''(''x'')}}).  Summing up all of the surface areas along the interval gives the total volume.\n\n==Parametric form==\n[[File:Paolo uccello, studio di vaso in prospettiva 02.jpg|thumb|[[Mathematics and art]]: study of a vase as a solid of revolution by [[Paolo Uccello]]. 15th century]]\n\nWhen a curve is defined by its parametric form {{math|(''x''(''t''),''y''(''t''))}} in some interval {{math|[''a'',''b'']}}, the volumes of the solids generated by revolving the curve around the {{mvar|x}}-axis or the {{mvar|y}}-axis are given by<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Application Of Integral Calculus\n|first=A.&nbsp;K.\n|last=Sharma\n|publisher=Discovery Publishing House\n|year=2005\n|isbn=81-7141-967-4\n|page=168\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V_WxjYMKuUAC&pg=PA168}}</ref>\n:<math>V_x = \\int_a^b \\pi y^2 \\, \\frac{dx}{dt} \\, dt \\, ,</math>\n\n:<math>V_y = \\int_a^b \\pi x^2 \\, \\frac{dy}{dt} \\, dt \\, .</math>\n\nUnder the same circumstances the areas of the surfaces of the solids generated by revolving the curve around the {{mvar|x}}-axis or the {{mvar|y}}-axis are given by<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Engineering Mathematics\n|edition=6th\n|first=Ravish R.\n|last=Singh\n|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill\n|year=1993\n|isbn=0-07-014615-2\n|page=6.90\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oQ1y1HCpeowC&pg=SA6-PA90}}</ref>\n:<math>A_x = \\int_a^b 2 \\pi y \\, \\sqrt{ \\left( \\frac{dx}{dt} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{dy}{dt} \\right)^2} \\, dt \\, ,</math>\n\n:<math>A_y = \\int_a^b 2 \\pi x \\, \\sqrt{ \\left( \\frac{dx}{dt} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{dy}{dt} \\right)^2} \\, dt \\, .</math>\n\n==See also==\n{{commons category|Solids of revolution}}\n* [[Gabriel's Horn]]\n* [[Guldinus theorem]]\n* [[Pseudosphere]]\n* [[Surface of revolution]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{cite web|website=CliffsNotes.com |title=Volumes of Solids of Revolution |date=12 Apr 2011 |url=http://www.cliffsnotes.com/study_guide/topicArticleId-39909,articleId-39907.html}} \n*{{cite book|author1-link=Frank J.
