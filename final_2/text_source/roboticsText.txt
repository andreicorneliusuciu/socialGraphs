*[[Actuator]], a [[Engine|motor]] that translates control signals into mechanical movement. The control signals are usually electrical but may, more rarely, be pneumatic or hydraulic. The power supply may likewise be any of these. It is common for electrical control to be used to modulate a high-power pneumatic or hydraulic motor.<ref name=ang>{{cite book|author=Joseph A.
